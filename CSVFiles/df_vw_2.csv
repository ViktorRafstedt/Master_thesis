Portrait of the Group
The Volkswagen Group, based in Wolfsburg, is one of the world’s 
leading automobile manufacturers and the largest automaker 
in Europe. In 2011 the Group increased the number of vehicles 
delivered to customers to 8.265 million (2010: 7.203 million), 
which equates to 12.3 percent of the global passenger car mar-
ket. 
In Western Europe more than one fifth of all new cars (23.0 per-
cent) were manufactured by the Volkswagen Group. The Group’s 
sales revenue totalled €159 billion in 2011 (2010: €126.9 billion). 
Profit after tax in the fiscal year 2011 totalled €15.8 billion (2010: €7.2 
billion). The Volkswagen Group owns ten brands from seven Euro-
pean countries: Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, Škoda, Bentley, Bugatti, 
Lamborghini, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN. 
Each brand has its own distinctive character and operates autono-
mously in the marketplace. The passenger car portfolio extends 
from economical compact cars to luxury high-end models. In the 
commercial vehicle sector, the range starts with pick-up trucks and 
extends all the way to buses and heavy-duty trucks. In other business 
areas the products manufactured within the Volkswagen Group in-
clude large-bore diesel engines for marine and stationary applica-
tions (turnkey power plants), turbochargers, turbomachinery 
(steam and gas turbines), compressors and chemical reactors. The 
portfolio also comprises special gear units for vehicles and wind tur-
bines, slide bearings and couplings, as well as testing systems for the 
mobility sector. Any changes in location or activities are set out in 
our current annual report under “Chronicle 2011”. 
  02
In 18 European countries and eight countries in the Americas, Asia 
and Africa, the Volkswagen Group operates 94 production facili-
ties. Around the world more than 500,000 employees produce ap-
proximately 34,500 vehicles per working day, provide vehicle-relat-
ed services or work in other business areas. The Volkswagen 
Group’s sales operations cover 153 countries. 
  01
The Group’s aim is to offer attractive, safe and eco-friendly vehicles 
that are capable of competing in an increasingly hard-fought mar-
ketplace and set the global benchmark in their respective classes.
Volkswagen AG’s subscribed capital increased to €1,190,995,443.20 
at the end of the fiscal year due to the conversion of the final tranche 
of the stock option plan. The distribution of voting rights at the re-
porting date was as follows: Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stutt-
gart, held 50.73 percent of the voting rights. The second-largest 
shareholder was the State of Lower Saxony, which held 20.0 per-
cent of the voting rights. Qatar Holding LLC was the third-largest 
shareholder, with 17.0 percent; Porsche GmbH, Salzburg, held a 
2.37 percent share of the voting rights. The remaining 9.9 percent 
of the 295,089,817 ordinary shares were attributable to other share-
holders. 
Notifications of changes in voting rights in accordance with the 
Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG – German Securities Trading 
 Act) are published on our website at www.volkswagenag.com/ir.

Dear Reader,
Last year was the most successful in the history of the Volkswagen Group. We set new records for 
all the key indicators, with 8.3 million vehicles delivered – over one million more than in the pre-
vious year – sales revenues of almost €160 billion and an operating profit of €11.3 billion.
For a company like Volkswagen, however, it is not enough to make a profitable business out of 
building superior vehicles, particularly in times like these that are marked by such fundamental 
economic and social change. Our Group squares up to the questions of our times. And what is 
more, we provide answers to those questions. 
The Volkswagen Group and its over 500,000 employees around the world adhere to the principle 
of responsibility:
•�in�the�interests�of�our�customers,�employees,�business�partners�and�shareholders;
•�in�the�interests�of�secure,�good�jobs�at�our�facilities�around�the�world;
•�in�the�interests�of�the�training�and�prospects�of�the�younger�generation;
•�in�the�interests�of�education,�science�and�the�arts;
•�in�the�interests�of�a�society�in�which�every�individual�can�fulfil�their�personal�potential;
•�and�above�all�in�the�interests�of�an�intact�environment.
Mobility is an inherent and fundamental human need. And mobility is a key driver of freedom and 
growth,�here�in�Europe�and�across�the�globe.�Our�job,�our�responsibility,�is�to�safeguard�the�future�
of widespread personal mobility, keeping it affordable, safe and environmentally compatible.  
That is why we recently gave the go-ahead for the far-reaching ecological restructuring of the 
Volkswagen Group: as a Group we are setting the bar much higher in terms of sustainability and 
at the same time setting ourselves new and ambitious goals. In overall terms we are going to re-
duce the CO2 emissions of our European new vehicle fleet by 30 percent by 2015, compared to 
2006. As a result, in 2015 for the first time ever our fleet will be below the key threshold of 120 
grams of CO2 per kilometre. Each new generation of our vehicles is on average 10 to 15 percent 
more efficient, and we are making our efficiency technologies – such as the start-stop system and 
recuperation – standard equipment in all new models. 
We are also aiming to make production operations at our plants around the world 25 percent 
more eco-friendly by 2018. In concrete terms that means 25 percent less energy and water con-
sumption,�emissions�and�waste.�One�major�contributory�factor�here�is�the�€600�million�invest-

ment we are making in energy from renewables, including solar and hydroelectric power and 
wind energy. This will lead to a 40 percent drop in CO2 emissions from energy supplies to our pro-
duction plants. We have also taken the pioneering step of appointing a Group Chief Officer for the 
Environment, Energy and New Business Areas.  
Just how seriously we mean business is underlined by our worldwide investment programme: of 
the €62.4 billion that we will be investing by 2016, plus an additional €14 billion in China together 
with� our� joint� venture� partners,� more� than� two� thirds� will� flow� directly� and� indirectly� into� in-
creasingly efficient vehicles, powertrains and technologies, as well as into environmentally com-
patible production at our plants around the world.
This report is designed to inform you about how we lived up to our responsibility in the 2011 finan-
cial�year�and�the�tasks�we�have�set�ourselves�for�the�future.�So�along�with�the�major�guidelines�pro-
vided by our sustainability strategy, you will find many informative examples from the economic, 
environmental and social sectors. To provide you, our readers, with maximum transparency, we 
have again had this report audited in accordance with the AA1000AS standard. And the Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI) has again awarded us its highest rating “A+”, which means our reporting is 
also compliant with the requirements of the German Sustainability Code. Our commitment to sus-
tainable development is further confirmed by our inclusion in international indexes such as the 
Dow�Jones�Sustainability�World�Index�or�the�FTSE4Good,�by�the�Carbon�Disclosure�Project�and�by�
our outstanding performance in attaining third place in the Sustainalytics DAX 30 rating. 
In all of this we continue to take our lead from our commitment to the UN Global Compact, the 
world’s largest initiative for businesses that support sustainability and responsibility, the protec-
tion of human rights and the battle against corruption. 
We hope you find this report makes interesting reading and provides you with a wealth of inform-
ative insights into the present and future world of the Volkswagen Group. 
Sincerely,
Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Martin Winterkorn

Automobile engineering and mobility systems are on the cusp 
of fundamental changes. During the “second half” of the auto-
mobile era we will see innovations that are at least as far-reach-
ing as those in its history to date. We are about to experience a 
veritable mobility boom: the number of cars worldwide is set to 
increase from roughly 1 billion at present to around 1.3 billion 
over the next ten years. We need to take a responsible approach 
to this growth. 
  07
More than ever, mobility is the driving force behind economic 
development in dynamic growth markets. Individual mobility 
enables people to participate in this progress and improve 
their prospects. This means that our Company, with over 
500,000 employees producing more than eight million vehi-
cles a year over 90 production sites worldwide, has a growing 
responsibility to make a sustainable contribution to a global 
mobility system. 
Thanks to our competitiveness and innovative strength, the 
number�of�jobs�in�the�Volkswagen�Group�showed�a�marked�rise�
of 103,000 last year. This was due not only to the acquisition of 
MAN and Porsche-Holding Salzburg, but also to organic growth: 
the�Company�created�28,000�jobs�worldwide,�including�11,000�
in Germany alone. 
The Volkswagen Group with its ten brands provides solutions  
in all vehicle segments from sub-compact cars to heavy-duty 
trucks and buses. We use the most efficient technologies and 
pave the way for fundamental innovations. 
We take our guidance here from sustainability and responsibility – 
the basic principles underlying Volkswagen’s corporate activities.
At Volkswagen, we view corporate social responsibility (CSR) as 
the contribution our Company makes to sustainable develop-
Global responsibility. 
The eT! research vehicle from Volkswagen  
shows how, from 2020 onwards, courier, parcel 
and postal services will be able to work more  
efficiently and with less impact on the environ-
ment. At 4.09 metres long and with a steering 
wheel that turns through 365 degrees, eT! will  
fit into (almost) any parking slot. Its lithium-ion 
battery gives it a range of 100 km, which is plen-
ty for urban logistics and delivery firms. An on-
board tablet PC guides the driver along his route, 
warns of congestion and even reminds him 
where he is likely to meet an aggressive dog. 
And with the “drive stick” the driver can get the 
van to follow him along automatically from one 
house to the next at 6 km/h and in almost com-
plete silence. 
By 2018 the Volkswagen Group aims to be the most profitable, fascinating and sustainable auto-
mobile manufacturer in the world. We are ready to accept the responsibility that goes with this 
status. Across the globe.

ment on our planet. In line with our Model of Sustainable De-
velopment, our way of doing business and our consumption of 
resources may not compromise opportunities for future gener-
ations. We pursue ecological, economic and social goals in the 
same measure and are thus an integral part of efforts to create a 
sustainable economic order on a global level.
Sustainability is the foundation of corporate policy at Volks- 
wagen. This means that sustainability is integrated along the 
entire value chain of our Company. Corporate responsibility at 
Volkswagen means always considering the impact on society 
and the environment. Sustainability also safeguards the Com-
pany’s long-term future. In order to make an effective contri-
bution to sustainable mobility, and as a company with global  
responsibility, Volkswagen is working hard to develop tech-
nologies for the cleanest, most fuel-efficient cars and efficient 
mobility concepts. And in all of this, Volkswagen is always 
aware�of�the�need�to�reconcile�job�security�with�economic�effi-
ciency.
New sustainability objectives
The Volkswagen Group has set itself ambitious new sustainabil-
ity�objectives:
>  CO2 emissions by the European new vehicle fleet will be reduced 
by some 30 percent during the period from 2006 to 2015 – emis-
sions will be below the threshold of 120 grams CO2/km for the 
first time by 2015.
>  Every new vehicle generation will be an average of 10 to 15 per-
cent more efficient.
>  Efficiency technologies such as start-stop and recuperation 
systems will be standard equipment in all new models. The 
new Audi A3 and the next Golf will lead the way.
>  2013 will be the year of electromobility with the Volkswagen 
e-up!, followed by numerous other hybrid and electric vehi-
cles from the Group’s brands.
These� aimed� ambitious� product� objectives� are� joined� by� far-
reaching goals amed at sustainability in the production sector:
>  Our worldwide production operations will become 25 percent 
greener by 2018 compared to 2010. Specifically, this means a 
25-percent cut in energy and water consumption, and in 
waste and emissions.
>  A 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to en-
ergy supplies to the production sector by 2020 compared to 
2010.
>  To this end some €600 million will be invested in the expansion 
of renewable energy from solar, wind and hydro power.
This marks the start of a fundamental ecological restructuring of 
the Volkswagen Group. By 2016 the Volkswagen Group is to invest 
€62.4 billion worldwide. In addition, together with our partners 
we will be investing a further €14 billion in China. Well over two 
thirds of this investment programme will go directly or indirectly 
into more efficient vehicles, powertrains and technologies, and 
into environmentally friendly operation of our production sites.
First-class team – responsibility for every individual
To achieve these ambitious targets, Volkswagen needs a first-
class team. The 500,000 people currently working worldwide to 
ensure the day-to-day success of the Volkswagen Group are 
500,000 individuals with a great variety of talents, qualifica-
tions and experience. And we foster each one of them. This is a 
responsibility we take seriously by focussing on our employees’ 
health, skills and commitment.
Ensuring that all employees can develop their full potential and 
use their talents in a manner that creates value calls for responsi-
 ble leadership, individual personnel development and training.
Vocational training is crucial to developing a top team at Volks-
wagen. In recent years, the Group has strengthened its commit-
ment to the German dual model of vocational training and 
brought further locations into its vocational training system. 
With the aid of the Student Talent Bank, the StartUp pro-
grammes and a number of other networked measures, Volks-
wagen is making sure of its next generation of expert staff.  
Volkswagen Coaching GmbH offers employees a wide range of 
made-to-measure opportunities to qualify for all occupations 
within the Group. And the AutoUni also offers extensive contin-
uing professional development programmes.

Strate gy
At Volkswagen, both career and family life are considered ex-
tremely important, which is why the Company is redoubling its 
efforts to create a family-friendly environment. Family-friendly 
HR policies are one of the keys to becoming a top employer. This 
commitment has a long track record: in 1989, Volkswagen was 
the�first�major�German�company�to�formulate�guidelines�on�ad-
vancing women, underpinned by tailored programmes. As early 
as 2007, Volkswagen AG had set specific targets for increasing 
the proportion of women in the Company. In spring 2011, the 
Group set differentiated targets within the framework of volun-
tary undertakings to achieve sustainable growth in the propor-
tion of women working for the Company in Germany. The Com-
pany’s “Woman DriveING Award” is designed to attract the best 
female engineers from the fields of mechanical engineering, 
electrical engineering, vehicle technology and mechatronics.
The Volkswagen Group takes its social responsibility seriously 
outside the factory gates as well, for example by promoting re-
gional growth initiatives in the areas where it operates. One ex-
ample of this is Wolfsburg AG, which since 2009 has been part-
nering� with� “projekt� Region� Braunschweig� GmbH”� project� to�
form the “Alliance for the Region”. The aim of the Alliance is to 
focus skills and resources for regional development more effec-
tively. The main goal of the collaboration is to develop struc-
tures�centred�on�creating�and�safeguarding�jobs�and�improving�
the quality of life. 
As a good corporate citizen, the Volkswagen Group sponsors not 
only regional development, but also a large number of world-
wide� CSR� projects� in� the� fields� of� art,� science� and� education,�
health promotion, sport and nature conservation. 
Sustainability requirements for suppliers  
Sustainability and responsibility are also becoming more and 
more important in relations with suppliers. Our suppliers are 
subject� to� the� same� stringent� ecological� and� social� standards�
and anti-corruption principles as our own production loca-
tions. Since its implementation in 2006 this concept has been 
developed steadily and systematically on the basis of regular 
evaluation. The foundation for effective monitoring of its imple-
mentation is provided by a newly developed digital question-
naire.
Sustainable mobility – solutions today and tomorrow
As a responsible global player with a strong tradition of social 
and ecological innovation, the Volkswagen Group is working in-
tensively on an overall approach to the sustainable mobility of 
the future, which is already beginning to take shape in numer-
ous�pilot�projects.�The�car�continues�to�be�the�central�means�of�
transport. Further optimisation of internal combustion en-
gines, hybridisation and powertrain electrification point the 
way forward. Ultimately the backbone of the vehicle fleet will 
consist of zero-emission electric vehicles, mainly as feeder traf-
fic within conurbations, as well as plug-in hybrids, which will 
operate in electric mode in urban areas but with their efficient 
internal combustion engines can also be used for travel out of 
town.
Particularly in urban core areas, provision of additional mobil-
ity solutions will encourage more frequent switching to alterna-
tives such as buses, rail or two-wheeled transport. Our custom-
ers will increasingly expect tailor-made transport solutions 
and, as far as possible, a seamless mobility chain. New vehicle 
concepts tailored to very specific mobility requirements, and 
optimally integratable into the wider public/private mobility 
system, will add to the range of options. Cars will communicate 
and cooperate with other vehicles and with alternative modes of 
transport, leading to increased multi-modal mobility and im-
proved overall transport efficiency. Services such as car-shar-
ing, rental services or logistics optimisation will round off the 
transport picture, ensuring that the mobility of the future offers 
greater overall diversity, efficiency and sustainability.

Strategy 2018 – firmly on course 
A very successful year for the Volkswagen Group in 2011 con-
firms that the course we adopted in Strategy 2018 to permanent-
ly establish our Company among the world’s most successful 
automakers was the right one. And by “most successful” we 
mean in terms of profitability, customer satisfaction, product 
quality, market development and volume growth, as well as our 
attractiveness as an employer. 
The driver of our progress towards becoming the most success-
ful automaker remains our vision of being the most profitable, 
fascinating and sustainable automobile company in the world 
by 2018. 
Sustainability management  
There are currently three core developments that impact on 
companies’ approach to sustainability management:
> At the political level there are efforts under way to intervene 
in corporate sustainability reporting and give it a more bind-
ing character. Expectations and requirements in terms of 
transparency and quality are on the increase. 
>  Customers – and key account or fleet customers in particular 
– are demanding verifiable compliance with strict sustaina-
bility criteria.
>  Financial market participants are increasingly basing their 
recommendations and decisions not only on the financial 
numbers, but also on companies’ CSR and sustainability pro-
files. In other words, for analysts, CSR and sustainability per-
formance are becoming key indicators of forward-looking 
corporate leadership. 
These trends go hand-in-hand with much higher expectations 
of companies’ sustainability management. Without abandon-
ing the foundations provided by a voluntary and thus competi-
tion-driven approach, for corporate players it is increasingly a 
question of putting in place a holistic and strategic sustainabili-
ty concept. In this sense, CSR means “the responsibility of en-
terprises for their impacts on society” as defined in the Re-
newed EU Strategy 2011-14 for Corporate Social Responsibility.

The Modular Transverse Matrix (MQb)
In the course of 2011, Volkswagen finalised its prepara-
tions for the launch of the Modular Transverse Matrix 
(MQB). The MQB, which will be introduced in 2012 for 
the Audi, Seat, Škoda and Volkswagen brands, is one of 
the biggest development initiatives in the history of 
the Group, and will achieve significant improvements 
not only in production efficiency but also, and above 
all, in sustainability, safety and comfort. The Modular 
Transverse Matrix is based on a flexible vehicle archi-
tecture that allows defined variations in some key con-
cept-defining dimensions of Group products such as 
wheelbase, track width, wheel size and seat position, 
while some dimensions such as the distance between 
the pedals and the centre of the front wheels are fixed, 
resulting in a standardised front-end system.
benefits for design
Front wheel repositioning towards the front of the car 
results in very balanced styling proportions and space-
maximising interior packaging. Partly due to the ability 
to vary wheelbase and track width, a modular matrix 
principle also offers much more potential than a plat-
form for creating widely differing types of vehicle, in-
cluding niche models with a strong emotional compo-
nent.
Environmental benefits
Completely redeveloped engine families with a strict 
focus on reducing CO2 output – measures include 
standard-fitted start/stop and recuperation systems, 
cylinder deactivation on the four-cylinder units (which 
include EU6-rated versions), and CNG versions –  
significantly reduce emissions. Along with millions 
of customers, the environment benefits as well – 
the MQB will cut CO2 emissions by more than one 
million tons a year. The electrically powered Golf Blue-
e-Motion, which will go into production in 2013, will 
also be MQB-based.
Weight benefits
Thanks to an intelligent multi-material mix and state-
of-the-art construction methods, the MQB will reverse 
the prevailing trend towards heavier vehicles. For ex-
ample despite including tremendous advances in the 
field of comfort and safety, the next generation of the 
Golf will weigh roughly the same as the fourth-genera-
tion model (1997-2004).

merge a modern understanding of responsibility and sustaina-
bility with the traditional values underlying entrepreneurial ac-
tivity. As a globally active company, Volkswagen is able to inte-
grate the fine tradition of shouldering responsibility in the 
sense of helping the needy (the traditional but restricted take 
on CSR as “charity”) with the new model of responsibility and 
sustainability. This new model unites the challenges of the 21st 
century, and in particular resource conservation and climate 
protection, with intra- and intergenerational fairness. The 
modern view of CSR sees responsibility and sustainability as 
two sides of the same coin, because sustainability calls precise-
ly for an equitable ultimate balance between the economic, eco-
logical and social dimensions. 
With its integrated CSR concept, the Volkswagen Group seeks to 
prevent risks, ensure timely identification of growth opportuni-
ties and enhance the Company’s reputation. Thus, CSR makes 
an important contribution to safeguarding the long-term future 
of the Company and increasing its value over time.

Corporate social responsibility and sustainability 
Group activities in the area of CSR and sustainability have been 
coordinated by a CSR office since 2006. Its responsibility is to 
align CSR activities strategically and optimise sustainability 
management. The idea of the office as a guidance unit has prov-
en itself with respect to both internal management processes 
and dialogue with external stakeholders. The CSR office coor-
dinates the regular interchange between brands and regions in 
the Volkswagen Group. It reports to the CSR & Sustainability 
Steering Group, which includes all central Group business are-
as�and�the�Group�Works�Council.�They�are�joined�by�representa-
tives�of�the�brands�and�regions.�The�objective�of�the�work�in�the�
steering group is to network the internal units and improve ex-
change processes between the technical departments. The 
Board of Management is kept regularly informed on the sub-
jects�of�sustainability�and�responsibility.�Our�CSR�project�teams�
carry out cross-functional work on topical issues such as the en-
hancement of the Group’s sustainability reporting; since the 
creation of a Group-wide CSR body in 2009 there has been a 
regular international exchange of information with the CSR co-
ordinators of the brands and regions. Coordination of the ac-
tivities of environmental managers across the Group is also as-
sisted by the Group Environmental Conference and a Corporate 
Environmental Steering Group. The appointment of a Group 
Chief Officer for the Environment, Energy and New Business 
Areas will help prepare the ground for an ecological restructur-
 ing of the Volkswagen Group in the long term.
With the introduction of the IT-based sustainability manage-
ment system and the further integration of the KPI (Key Perfor-
mance Indicator) system, we have created the basis for compre-
hensive and timely CSR and sustainability reporting in the 
Group. The control efficiency and transparency of the KPI sys-
tem allow Volkswagen to meet the increasing expectations of its 
stakeholders for an up-to-date, differentiated presentation of 
the Company’s CSR and sustainability performance.

Stakeholder dialogue
For Volkswagen, the ability to help shape national, European 
and international corporate networks is an important compo-
nent of the permanent dialogue with key social groups and ac-
tors. Volkswagen contributes its technical and social capacity 
here�and�supports�numerous�projects.�The�Group�is�represent-
ed on the board of the leading European business network for 
corporate social responsibility, CSR Europe. At a national level, 
we are involved in econsense, the Forum for Sustainable Devel-
opment of German Business. Along with numerous other com-
panies, Volkswagen has signed the “Code of Responsible Con-
duct for Business” initiative.  
  09
 
Global Compact 
Since 2002, Volkswagen has been committed to the largest and 
most important CSR initiative in the world, the Global Compact. 
The 7,000 participating companies from over 135 countries work 
together to shape a more sustainable and equitable world econ-
omy. Volkswagen makes a significant contribution to this initia-
tive and publishes an annual Communication on Progress re-
garding� its� diverse� international� CSR� projects.� In� 2011� we�
attained Global Compact Advanced Level.
Ten principles governing human rights, labour standards, en-
vironmental protection and the fight against corruption de-
scribe the values of the Global Compact. At all locations of our 
Company, we again guided our business activities by these 
principles in 2011. With our expertise, we also help other com-
panies in the Global Compact to embrace their global respon-
sibility. An example of this is our active participation on the 
advisory� board� for� the� “Sustainable� Supplier� Chain”� project.�
Volkswagen will also be committing to the Rio+20 campaign 
process. 
  10
Cooperation with NAbu 
Over the last ten years and more, Volkswagen and Germany’s 
largest environmental organisation, the German Nature and 
Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), have built up a unique 
cooperation based on three components: a) advice, b) dialogue, 
and�c)�projects.��In�the�course�of�this�cooperation,�the�success�of�
which is founded on the mutual respect of existing differences 
of interest, we raise society’s awareness of environmental and 
sustainability�issues,�for�example�through�jointly-run�fuel-saver�
courses.� The� efficient� fleet� management� project� run� by� Volks-
wagen Leasing GmbH, meanwhile, is a success in both ecologi-
cal and a commercial terms. It involves using the Group’s most 
fuel-efficient models in each case. Here, cutting CO2 emissions 
goes hand-in-hand with cost savings for the fleet operators. The 
project� also� helps� to� fund� a� moorland� protection� initiative,�
which is a particularly efficient form of climate protection, giv-
en that moorlands are significant carbon sinks.

Code of Conduct and policies
With our Code of Conduct we provide our employees with a guide-
line that brings together the key basic behavioural principles un-
derlying our activities and helps them master the legal and ethical 
challenges of their daily work. The Code of Conduct constitutes a 
Group-wide guideline that is binding for all of our employees and 
members of executive bodies. Each individual bears equal respon-
sibility for ensuring compliance with the Code. 
Based on these principles,
>  we act responsibly, for the benefit of our customers, share-
holders and employees;
>  we consider compliance with international conventions, 
laws and internal rules to be the basis for sustainable and 
successful economic activities;
> we act in accordance with our declarations;
>  we accept responsibility for our actions.
The Group’s values – “closeness to the customer, superior per-
formance, value creation, renewability, respect, responsibility 
and sustainability” – are the basis for Group-wide collaboration 
and have been incorporated into our Code of Conduct.
Along with our corporate values, we base our actions on a num-
ber of conventions, laws and internal regulations drawn up by 
international organisations. They are primarily addressed to 
the respective member states, not to individual companies. 
They do, however, constitute important guidelines for the be-
haviour of an international corporate group and its employees. 
We therefore attach great importance worldwide to ensuring 
that our corporate activities are in keeping with these guide-
lines. The main conventions of this kind are listed below:
>  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, dating from 
1948 (UNO)
>  European Convention on Human Rights, 1950
>  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, 1966
>  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966
>  Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multination-
al Enterprises and Social Policy, ILO (International Labour 
Organisation) 1977
>  ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work, 1998 (especially the following topics: abolition of child 
labour; elimination of forced or compulsory labour; ban on 
discrimination; freedom of association; and the right to col-
lective bargaining)
16 
Strate gy
>  OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public 
Officials in International Business Transactions, 1997
>  “Agenda 21” on sustainable development (final document of 
the groundbreaking United Nations Conference on Environ-
ment and Development, Rio de Janeiro 1992)
>  Principles of the Global Compact for more social and more 
ecological globalisation, 1999
>  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, 2000 
We also profess our commitment to the “Declaration on Social 
Rights and Industrial Relationships at Volkswagen” (Volkswagen 
Social Charter) and the Charter on Labour Relations concerning 
fundamental social rights and principles.

On the way to sustainable mobility it is only by taking a longer-
term view of the future that we will be able to integrate underly-
ing social and technological trends into our research and devel-
opment activities. It was with this in mind that Volkswagen 
Group Research formulated its “Research Visions” in 2010. The 
topics are mobility, energy, the driving experience, safety, cost-
effectiveness in the product life cycle, and the environment. 
And with our Environmental Radar we have also created a sepa-
rate early-warning system for evaluating ecological risks. 
 
Volkswagen in sustainability ratings and indexes
Financial market participants increasingly base their recom-
mendations and decisions not only on the financial numbers, 
but also on companies’ CSR and sustainability profiles. Analysts 
and investors view CSR and sustainability performance as lead-
ing indicators of forward-looking corporate leadership. Sus-
tainability ratings are particularly well suited to capturing the 
environmental, social and economic performance of a compa-
ny. If the highest scores are achieved in these ratings, it not only 
sends a clear signal to stakeholders but also raises the compa-
ny’s attractiveness as an employer externally and the motivation 
of its existing employees internally. As in the previous year, in 
2011 Volkswagen was again able to maintain its position among 
the leaders in its sector in the most important international rat-
ings and indexes.
Volkswagen is one of only three automobile companies listed in 
the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. In the assessment by 
Swiss asset management company SAM on behalf of Dow Jones, 
Volkswagen scored top marks especially for environmental 
management and employment growth, as well as for risk man-
agement, social commitment and stakeholder relations. As of 
December 31, 2011, Volkswagen was represented in the following 
sustainability indices: Advanced Sustainability Performance In-
dex (ASPI), Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI), Dow 
Jones Sustainability World Index, ECPI Ethical Index Europe, 
ECPI Ethical Index EMU, ECPI Ethical Index Global, Ethibel 
Sustainability Index (ESI), FTSE4Good and STOXX ESG Leaders 
Indices.

We� subjected� the� findings� of� the� materiality� analysis� we� con-
ducted last year – see Sustainability Report 2010 – to close scru-
tiny. As well as using the tried and tested process of analysing 
international and current sustainability studies and require-
ments, we were also quick to engage in dialogue with the key 
stakeholders. The aim was to undertake a critical review of our 
current views. At a workshop with representatives from the 
fields of politics and local government, financial analysis, envi-
ronmental associations, trade unions, the Works Council and 
academia, we discussed in detail the main challenges facing the 
automobile industry and our Company. In a second step we 
evaluated potential approaches and formulated expectations. 
New challenges
The outcome was that key findings from last year were reaf-
firmed but some were assigned greater or lesser importance. 
Important topics included the greater future significance of  
water, of networked mobility solutions and of innovative ap-
proaches�to�providing�job�security.�This�procedure�enabled�us�

Attaining 
leadership. 
Volkswagen is on its way to becoming the top automaker. By 2018 the Group is aiming to be 
the No. 1 in the automobile industry – both economically and ecologically.
Customer satisfaction 
Satisfied customers are a top priority. And from a sustainability 
perspective, customer satisfaction is a key indicator of how well 
product developments and model facelifts cater to the needs of 
stakeholders. The Volkswagen brand, for instance, has made 
customer satisfaction a key component of its “Mach 18” strategy. 
Against this backdrop, we invariably gear our sales activities to-
ward boosting customer satisfaction. In 2011, we continued to 
implement effective measures and introduced processes that 
will enable us to further increase the satisfaction of our vehicle-
buying and aftermarket customers, as well as our dealers.
In the European core markets, the Audi brand occupies a top 
position in customer satisfaction. Around the world, satisfac-
tion with the Volkswagen brand is also high. In 2011, the Volks-
wagen brand evaluated customer satisfaction in 19 markets and 
in three front-line categories: the purchasing process, the 
workshop visit and the use of the vehicle. Since launching its 
customer satisfaction programme in 2009, Volkswagen has im-
proved on the competition as follows (averaging all markets): 
satisfaction with the dealer up 6 places (from 17th to 11th), satis-
faction with the workshop up 4 places (from 13th to 9th) and sat-
isfaction with the product (vehicle) up 7 places (from 12th to 
5th).
To obtain data for analysis, we conduct market studies, define 
needs in customer workshops and evaluate posts in online dis-
cussion forums. Our findings are reported to the Board of Man-
agement up to six times a year. In China, for example, Volkswa-
gen�started�a�very�special�“People’s�Car�Project”�(PCP)�in�2011.�
This initiative actively involves customers in designing the 
products of the future. 
In�view�of�the�ranking�performance�quoted�above,�our�objective�
remains realistic – by 2018 we aim to rank as one of the world’s 
top three automakers in terms of customer satisfaction. Our in-
terim goal for 2012, to be among the top five, remains un-
changed. To measure how successful we are in meeting these 
objectives,�we�refer�to�the�New�Car�Buyer�Study�(NCBS)�and�the�
International Aftersales Customer Satisfaction Study (IACS). 
Complaint handling is essential to boosting customer satisfac-
tion. An example from the USA illustrates our commitment in 
this area: here, every complaint is analysed, all the way to a 
face-to-face meeting with the customer if necessary. The goal is 
to understand the complaint and what the customer expects. 
Next, clear responsibilities are defined to eliminate the com-
plaint: the plant concerned is responsible for all complaints re-
lating to quality; any complaints about the purchasing process 
are used to optimise sales organisation procedures; and com-
plaints related to the vehicle concept are forwarded to the Tech-
nical Development department, where they are used to derive 
measures for the next model generation. All complaints and de-
rived measures are centrally monitored and tracked. They are 
immediately integrated in existing processes and subsequent 
projects,�thus�preventing�faults�from�reoccurring.�
In this way, customer wishes and expectations influence prod-
uct development. But meeting these individual needs in various 
markets is a challenge for a Group that also strives for efficien-
cy. Volkswagen resolves this issue through its global modular 
strategy, which enables models to be manufactured around the 
world while also taking account of local customer needs and 
wishes regarding technology, equipment and price. One exam-
ple from 2011 shows how this works: while the Passat for the 
1    
million more vehicles sold 
than in the previous year 
marks the highest growth 
rate of any automaker.

Chinese market primarily caters to customers looking for an 
exclusively-equipped car in the higher price segment, the new 
Passat for the USA above all meets customer wishes for a com-
fortable sedan at an attractive price. 
When taking customer wishes into account, Volkswagen is al-
ways�aware�of�another�conflict�of�objectives:�even�a�pared-down�
model with basic equipment must meet the standards that cus-
tomers rightfully expect from a global technology leader such as 
Volkswagen. This awareness is a prerequisite for achieving our 
goal, which is not only to meet customers’ expectations, but to 
delight them with our products.
“Think blue.”  
“Think Blue.” is the Volkswagen brand’s stance on environ-
mental sustainability. Behind this mindset is Volkswagen’s 
claim to shoulder responsibility above and beyond offering en-
vironmentally compatible products and solutions. The aim here 
is to inspire and motivate everyone to optimise their environ-
mental behaviour in everyday life in a way that is fun and does 
not involve doing without. The brand’s holistic approach to 
“Think� Blue.”� includes� ecologically� meaningful� projects� and�
initiatives around the world. 
The aim for 2011 was to establish “Think Blue.” as the mindset of 
the Volkswagen brand in the long term, based on increasing in-
ternationalisation.  Also, with “Think Blue.” we reached out to 
all our stakeholders, from employees to consumers. Another 
important part of our activities was to anchor “Think Blue.” 
along the entire value chain. A whole series of measures were 
put in place, including Eco Incentive seminars for importers 
and dealers and POS campaigns for the trade, as well as an in-
house ideas competition and other initiatives for employees. In 
our�customer�communications�too,�numerous�projects�were�re-
alised around the world: from an interactive exhibition at the 
Autostadt in Wolfsburg to the inspiring and educational “Think 
Blue.” camps in Spain and the international fuel-saving chal-
lenge, the “Think Blue. Championship 2011”. “Think Blue.” was 
also given a stronger online presence in the shape of informa-
tive international websites, as well as engaging dialogue plat-
 forms like the German-language website mythinkblue.de.  
 
  16,  
  17,  
  18
A�number�of�other�long-term�projects�along�“Think�Blue.”�lines�
were also kicked off in 2011. These included the communica-
tions that accompanied such innovative mobility services as the 
car-sharing�project�Quicar�in�Hanover�or�cooperation�with�se-
lected initiatives to step up the involvement of young people, 
such�as�“YOUTHinkgreen”.�These�and�many�other�projects�are�
being continued in 2012. At trade fairs and consumer shows in 
Customers design cars of the future.
Keeping the customer satisfied is all about being 
sensitive to their needs and identifying their wishes, 
understanding these wishes and responding to them. 
With this in mind, in 2011 Volkswagen China 2011 
launched a special initiative called the People’s Car 
Project (PCP). This actively involves customers in the 
design of future products. Via an online platform 
everyone can give free rein to their creative ideas and 
develop their own vehicle concept.
The project is made up of different phases. In 2011 
participants were asked to submit ideas in the cate-
gories of Design and Customisation. This is being  
followed in 2012 by the categories Connectivity and 
Ecology. All participants can evaluate one another’s 
ideas and suggest improvements. At the same time, 
an agency monitors the ideas submitted and an-
nounces a winner every day. This way, the partici-
pants get direct feedback on their concepts. In Febru-
ary 2012, Volkswagen China and Tongji University 
together staged a screening of the ideas submitted 
so far. Of the 111,907 submissions to date, 26,265 con-
tain material with potential for Volkswagen. 
These ideas also revealed initial trends: participants 
are keen to see a higher level of customisation for 
their vehicles as well as better adaptation to inner 
city motoring. Safety concepts are also high on the 
agenda. Now the relevant ideas are to be discussed 
with the Research & Development departments at a 
final workshop, to enable them to be fed into the 
product development process.

Geneva, Paris and Hanover, for example, “Think Blue.” formed 
an integral part of the Volkswagen products and services on 
show. And “Think Blue.” can also be experienced at the wheel: 
the “Think Blue. Trainer.” system in the up! is designed to lead 
the driver towards an eco-friendly driving style in an entertain-
ing way.

Supplier relations  
Since 2006 Volkswagen has been implementing its “Sustaina-
bility in Supplier Relations” concept, which is built on four pil-
lars:
> Sustainability requirements for suppliers, which all 
 suppliers must read before submitting quotes
> An early warning system for minimising risk
> A transparent procurement process
> A supplier monitoring and development process
From the very start, the concept has undergone continuous, sys-
tematic development. Regular evaluations of all concept struc-
tures and components ensure that it continues to evolve.
To effectively monitor implementation, a newly-developed, 
cross-functional process was put into action in 2012. It is based 
Überraschende 
Beispiele, wie 
Nachhaltigkeit mit  
Spaß gelingt, zeigt  
die FunTheory
on a digital questionnaire, which is mandatory for all suppliers. 
If the entries made do not meet Volkswagen’s specifications, 
the supplier is requested to provide a written statement. Ad-hoc 
teams of experts from the various brands and regions evaluate 
suppliers’ answers. The focus is on supplier development 
through dialogue. Available documents are analysed, and sup-
pliers may also be visited on site. If a supplier does not demon-
strate sufficient willingness to develop, the Volkswagen Group 
has in the past suspended the business relationship and will 
continue to do so in future. 
Even so, twelve possible violations in the areas of pay, occupa-
tional health and safety, working hours, discrimination, free-
dom of association as well as environmental protection were 
reported in supplier operations during 2011. All cases were clar-
ified, corresponding measures were introduced and any defi-
cits eliminated. Throughout this process, Volkswagen seeks to 
provide its suppliers and partners with practical support.
The regular meetings and videoconferences held by the “Sus-
tainable Procurement Network” include reports on how con-
cept implementation is progressing in the brands and regions. 
In light of this, Volkswagen India organised a third series of 
supplier development events, focusing on supplier awareness 
and development opportunities. The network’s activities centre 
on collectively taking the concept forward while catering for re-
gional differences. 
Volkswagen strives to keep the 
dialogue with its business part-
ners and suppliers as simple as 
possible. To this end the Volks-
wagen Group Supply online 
platform was redesigned in 2011 
and can now be easily called up 
on mobile devices.

suspected cases of non-compli-
ance by suppliers in respect of 
pay, industrial health and safety, 
working hours, discrimination, 
human rights, freedom of association and  
environmental protection were successfully 
clarified by Volkswagen.
In 2011, the central business platform www.vwgroupsupply.com 
was successfully relaunched. Featuring improved navigation, 
the platform promotes direct, global exchanges between Volks-
wagen and its suppliers. The “Sustainability in Supplier Rela-
tions” concept has become integral to this portal – parallel to 
the relaunch, a globally-accessible eLearning module was de-
veloped in nine languages. This module will be available on the 
Group business platform in 2012. 
  20
Volkswagen also works on sustainability in supplier relations 
from the inside out, educating its own employees. New hires in 
Procurement participate in the WISTA familiarisation pro-
gramme, which includes skills related to sustainable supplier 
relations. 
In the year under review, Volkswagen further developed and in-
tensified relations with its business partners – strengthening 
the foundations for fair, stable, long-term partnerships with 
suppliers. The Volkswagen Group Award, honouring suppliers 
who excel in topics such as sustainability and environmental 
protection, once again highlighted particularly successful part-
nerships.
To take the concept of “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” 
forward, Volkswagen actively engages in dialogue with other or-
ganisations and companies, for example in the Forum for Sus-
tainable Development of German Business (econsense). In 2011, 
Volkswagen�took�on�a�leading�role�in�the�“Supply�Chain”�project�
group. 
In the next few years, the ongoing development of our suppliers 
will become an increasingly decisive factor in implementing 
our sustainability concept.

Economic stability
Global growth continued in 2011, with some loss of momentum. 
The Asian emerging markets remained highly dynamic, though 
their pace of growth slowed somewhat. Meanwhile growth re-
mained weak in the world’s industrialised markets and espe-
cially in Western Europe, where the worsening national debt 
crises� in� the� southern� European� states� proved� a� major� hin-
drance. This weak phase is set to continue into 2012: unresolved 
structural problems in many states and a widespread loss of 
confidence in economic policy have prompted growing uncer-
tainty among producers and consumers and ongoing volatility 
on the financial and currency markets. Eurozone markets un-
der� severe� pressure� include� not� just� Greece� and� Portugal� but�
also Spain and Italy in particular. Sustainable growth cannot be 
anticipated in Western Europe until clear progress is made to-
wards resolving the national debt crises and restoring trust in 
the political process and the markets. 
Volkswagen is set to face significant challenges in the medium 
term, resulting on the one hand from emerging global econom-
ic trends, and on the other from the growing size and complexi-
ty of the Company itself and from increasingly intense market 
competition.   
Global economic trends
In the coming years the emerging markets – and the BRIC 
states in particular – will become increasingly significant in 
both economic and political terms. This effect will be further 
amplified if the traditional industrialised markets fail to get to 
grips with their economies’ structural problems and to opti-
mise what is already a reduced capacity for growth.
China and India in particular are set to see further dynamic 
growth, while Brazil and Russia will also make further head-
way�in�the�rankings�of�the�major�economic�players.�This�shift�
towards new centres of global economic growth will increas-
ingly impact international trading and finance flows as well as 
the energy and commodities markets. The BRIC countries will 
also exert a greater influence on global politics in order to 
safeguard their economic interests.
Rapid economic progress affecting broad sections of these pop-
ulations, with the associated increase in household incomes, 
opens up significant opportunities for the automotive industry 
in terms of sales volumes – as previous years have clearly 
shown.  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the medium term the global economy and global trade will 
show further growth, although the danger of economic crises 
remains high. 
Key risk factors here include the high and growing levels of na-
tional debt in many countries, structural mismanagement in 
numerous national economies, the high vulnerability of the in-
ternational banking and finance system, ongoing trading and 
current account imbalances, the increase in protectionist 
trends and growing inflationary trends which could spread 
from the commodities and oil markets in particular. 
Increasing competition
Competition continues to intensify in the global automotive 
markets. During the past year the American manufacturers  
already showed clear signs of recovery from the effects of the  
financial and economic crisis. In the current year, Japanese 
suppliers are looking to recapture market positions which were 
lost when sales volumes fell due to the natural disasters in  
Japan and Thailand. The Korean manufacturers are set to con-
tinue their global expansion strategy and Chinese automakers, 
too, will become increasingly important, primarily in the 
emerging markets.
Measured against its competitors, the Volkswagen Group ad-
vanced to second place in the global deliveries rankings for 
2011, achieving the highest growth of all automakers with more 
than one million additional vehicles delivered. At the same time 
the Group recorded a significant improvement in its operating 
profit. These results show that we are well on course to achieve 
the goals we have set ourselves for 2018. 
Operating sustainably means taking responsibility 
Volkswagen already has a strong presence in many important 
markets and is profiting from global growth. In view of the 
global trends and risks outlined here, in future it will be even 
more important to improve the conditions for sustainable 
growth and develop new growth opportunities. 
We must further extend our technology leadership and miti-
gate the risks arising from currency fluctuations and protec-
tionism by systematically developing local value creation. In-
creasing localisation in our products and financial services 
will be a central prerequisite for achieving appropriate qual-
ity standards worldwide and improving our competitiveness 
over the long term. For the coming years Volkswagen is there-
fore planning the highest investments in the Company’s his-
tory, accompanied by a further increase in workforce num-
bers.
A high level of flexibility and financial independence is abso-
lutely essential for dealing successfully with economic risks. 
Here, our outstanding liquidity position and our comprehen-
sive safeguards against price fluctuations in the currency and 
commodities markets will continue to help us in the future. At 
the same time efficient utilisation of production capacity and 
rigorous cost management have a key role to play in ensuring 
that the Group remains robust and crisis-proof over the long 
term. 
We emerged from the global economic crisis more rapidly than 
expected and stronger than most of our competitors. We can 
only continue along the path to global automotive leadership 
mapped out in our Strategy 2018 by operating responsibly and 
sustainably. As the Volkswagen Group grows in size and com-
plexity, the level of responsibility – for the Company and its em-
ployees – will increase further. Volkswagen can only achieve 
sustainable success by taking more and more responsibility for 
the environment and for social developments, particularly in 
emerging markets. Every single employee has a part to play 
here: through our skills and commitment, we shoulder our re-
sponsibility for the Group’s ongoing development and future 
success.
Raw materials    
The topic of raw materials has a twofold relevance for the Volks-
wagen Group: on the one hand there is the ecological angle; on 
the other hand the commercial perspective. Because for a corpo-
rate group that processes millions of tons of steel, plastics and 
other materials every year, secure and economic supplies of 
these materials are of vital importance – and at the same time a 
core commercial parameter. 
Volkswagen controls this parameter via its raw materials man-
agement strategy. Raw materials risk analyses help evaluate 
long-term strategic indicators for the materials. Factors identi-
fied and evaluated for Volkswagen include supply risk and cost 
relevance, leading either to concrete orders being issued to R&D 
for the development of alternative materials and substitutes or to 
recommendations being issued to Central Procurement and 
Treasury to help safeguard raw material supplies.
The analysis system, originally introduced in 2007, was again ex-
panded in 2011 and used for example to conduct a long-term raw-
materials risk forecast related to electromobility. The geostrate-
gic risk involved in the extraction of lithium was identified, while 
at the same time mathematical algorithms were used to factor in 
E co nomy       S o ci e t y       E nvi r onme nt    
 
 
 
 
 
 
27
issues such as market power resulting from industry concentra-
tion. This enabled concrete recommendations to be derived, so 
that while for cobalt, for example, hedging via the stock exchange 
is an option, for lithium the strategic goal must be to arrive at di-
versity of suppliers. Consequently, raw materials risk analysis is a 
key tool in enabling more secure and economic supplies of raw 
materials to be assured for as long as possible. The system won 
our in-house research award in 2011. 
To identify early on any risks to secure long-term supplies arising 
from corruption, Volkswagen regularly engages in dialogue with 
the Extractive Industries Transparencies Initiative (EITI). 
Localisation
Volkswagen believes in systematic localisation, so wherever 
possible, the local production plants themselves handle the val-
ue-added processes, supported by local and regional suppliers. 
The�benefits�are�not�just�logistical�but�commercial,�as�well.�Lo-
calisation reduces currency risks and on the purchasing front 
ensures prices in line with local market conditions, with no ad-
ditional costs for transport or customs duties. Above and be-
yond this, localisation also generates immense growth poten-
tial� in� the� respective� regions;� jobs� are� created� and� new�
companies spring up in the vicinity of our plants, while second-
ary and tertiary effects have a positive impact on the infrastruc-
ture. At our Indian plant in Pune, 58 new supplier operations 
were set up and 12,000 new workplaces created indirectly 
through secondary employment effects. Volkswagen also wit-
nessed similar developments at its Kaluga plant in Russia, 
where� 12� new� supplier� firms� were� established� and� 4,370� jobs�
created. And at the Chattanooga plant (USA) 17 new companies 
were established in the vicinity of the new Volkswagen plant 
and�1,700�jobs�were�created.�In�the�long�term,�Volkswagen�will�
be able to offer employment to 10,000 people at this site. Anoth-
er effect of localisation is that establishing a new plant and se-
lecting the relevant suppliers will often lead to new alliances 
with�schools�and�universities,�trigger�social�projects�and�foster�
cultural diversity. In short, it drives up local prosperity, benefit-
ing both the business sector and society. So for Volkswagen, lo-
calisation not only has economic benefits; it also improves the 
prospects of sustainable structural development in the regions 
concerned. 
Risk management
The Group’s risk management system is designed to identify po-
tential risks at any early stage so that suitable countermeasures 
can be taken to avert the threat of loss to the Company, and so 
that�any�risks�that�might�jeopardise�its�continued�existence�can�
be ruled out.
The risk management system is an integral part of the Volkswa-
gen Group’s structure and workflows and is embedded in its

daily business processes. Events that entail a risk are identified 
and assessed on a decentralised basis in the divisions and at the 
investees. Countermeasures are introduced immediately, their 
effects are assessed and the information is incorporated into 
the planning in a timely manner. The results of the risk man-
agement process are used to support budget planning and con-
trolling on an ongoing basis. The targets agreed in the budget 
planning rounds are continually verified in revolving planning 
reviews.
At the same time, the results of risk mitigation measures that 
have already been taken are incorporated into the monthly 
forecasts on further business development in a timely manner. 
This means that the Board of Management always has access to 
an overall picture of the current risk situation through the doc-
umented reporting channels.
We are prepared to enter into transparent risks that are propor-
tionate to the benefits expected from the business.  
  22
Compliance   
In line with the German Corporate Governance Code, the Volks-
wagen Group ensures that its compliance efforts keep pace 
with the economic growth of the Company. In 2011 additional 
chief compliance officers, compliance officers and representa-
tives were appointed. Around the world, they are responsible 
for making sure that all preventive compliance measures are 
put in place on site. They support the Group Chief Compliance 
Officer, who in turn reports directly to the Chairman of the 
Board of Management. Complementing their efforts, the Com-
pliance Council – a body of opinion leaders – started work in 
2011 at top management level. Along with the Core Compliance 
Team, the Council forms an important part of the Group’s com-
pliance organisation.
The basic content of all activities undertaken by the compli-
ance organisation is defined by the “preventive concept for en-
suring compliance within the Volkswagen Group”. This takes 
its lead from the contents prescribed in the voluntary auditing 
standard of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) 
for the verification of compliance management systems (IDW 
PS 980). Another pillar of the Group’s compliance work is the 
Code of Conduct of the Volkswagen Group. A variety of meas-
ures based on the Code were implemented in the reporting pe-
riod. 
  14
In a standardised and integrated risk management and control 
process, each year all substantial risks, countermeasures and 
controls are registered and evaluated at some 100 business 
units (companies and central departments) of the Volkswagen 
Group,�which�together�account�for�the�majority�of�the�consoli-
dated balance sheet and income statement. In this context, 
compliance risks such as corruption are specifically addressed 
for each business unit involved and evaluated at the units. This 
evaluation forms a central pillar of the annual compliance pro-
gramme.
In 2011 one focus of compliance activities was on competition 
and�anti-trust�legislation.�Using�documents�on�the�subject�and�
a variety of communications channels, specific groups of em-
ployees were provided with readily comprehensible support in 
anti-trust matters. An appropriate mission statement from the 
Chairman of the Board of Management was also distributed to 
top and senior management. 
Another focal point of compliance work was the implementa-
tion of measures to prevent corruption. An online tuition pro-
gramme� on� the� subject� was� rolled� out� at� all� Volkswagen� AG� 
locations as well as at additional Group companies, enabling a 
E co nomy       S o ci e t y       E nvi r onme nt

total of over 40,000 employees of Volkswagen AG and Group 
brands to benefit from training. Also in 2011, some 6,000 Volks-
wagen brand employees were informed about compliance- 
related topics in almost 200 in-depth on-site seminars. In addi-
tion to these events, employees also receive regular updates on 
compliance through internal communication channels. 
2011 also brought completion of the pilot version of a Group-
wide IT-based information, advisory and reporting system. The 
system will be installed at Volkswagen AG in 2012 before being 
progressively rolled out to other Group companies. 
At Volkswagen, the role of ombudsman is played by independ-
ent lawyers. They act as the first point of contact for employees 
or third parties wishing to report suspected instances of cor-
ruption in a straightforward and confidential way. In 2011 the 
ombudsmen passed on 36 reports to the internal Anti-Corrup-
tion Officer at Volkswagen AG. All such reports are followed up. 
In the course of 2011, Volkswagen AG issued three dismissals on 
account of violations of the internal regulations prohibiting 
the exploitation of business contacts for personal gain.
Against the backdrop of the global growth of the Group, in 2012 
the prevention of corruption in growth markets will be the key 
focus of compliance activities. Preventive measures remain a 
cornerstone of compliance work across the Group.

Employment
The Volkswagen Group’s Strategy 2018 sets out how it intends to 
achieve its goal of becoming the car industry’s global market 
leader in terms of unit sales and topping the rankings in terms 
of customer satisfaction and profitability. On top of that, Volks-
wagen also wants to be the most attractive employer in the auto-
motive sector by 2018. The Group’s business strategy is a multi-
dimensional stakeholder strategy that balances the interests of 
customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
Volkswagen has continued to develop at great speed in 2011: the 
Group opened new locations, launched new models in the mar-
ket, and further expanded its technological advantage. As the 
Volkswagen Group grows, so does its responsibility – for cus-
tomers and society, for product and the environment, for every 
employee and for the entire Company. However, it can only 
meet present and future challenges if its employees – from ap-
prentices to top managers – consistently turn in an outstanding 
Everyone counts.
performance to ensure that innovation and product quality  
remain at the very highest level in the long term.
Securing outstanding performance, generating success and 
giving employees a share in the profits are central to Volks- 
wagen’s HR strategy. Securing the outstanding performance re-
quired to assure Volkswagen of pole position in the internation-
al automobile industry means having a top team, an HR 
principle that applies across the Group’s global operations. And 
it is a principle that is particularly important when the Group is 
growing, as it has done over the past few years. Including the 
Chinese�joint�ventures,�the�Volkswagen�Group�employed�a�total�
of 501,956 people on December 31, 2011, 25.7 percent more than 
in December 2010 (399,381 employees).
Volkswagen fulfils its responsibility for its employees with per-
sonnel management that promotes the health, skills and dedi-
cation of every individual. Ensuring that all employees can de-
velop their full potential and use their talents in a manner that 
creates value means responsible leadership, individual person-
nel development and training.
Training and skills development
Skills levels across the Group are already outstanding, but to 
ensure that they are maintained despite rapid growth, Volks-
wagen sets great store by being a learning and teaching organi-
sation. Vocational training is crucial to developing a top team at 
Volkswagen. In recent years, it has strengthened its commit-
ment to the German dual model of vocational training and 
brought further locations into its vocational training system. In 
December 2011, the number of employees in vocational training 
across the Volkswagen Group exceeded 15,000 for the first time, 
including 10,779 in Germany. 
At the end of 2011, Volkswagen AG was training 4,667 apprenti-
ces and students in 33 professions and 20 courses at its six Ger-
man locations alone (Wolfsburg, Hanover, Braunschweig, Kas-
sel, Emden and Salzgitter). Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH had 
already taken on apprentices and students from the insolvent 
501,956 people now work for the Volkswagen Group. That means 501,956 individual contributions to its day-to-
day success and 501,956 individual sets of talents. And we foster each one of them. It’s a responsibility we take 
seriously by focussing on our employees’ health, skills and commitment. And we are aware that our responsibil-
ity is growing – for ourselves as a company and for each individual within it.
The circle of success from our “Strategy 2018” shows that only an attractive 
employer can recruit a good team and develop it into a top team. And only a 
top team can turn in excellent performance.

Wilhelm Karmann GmbH in 2010, enabling them to continue 
their training in a work setting, and in 2011, it created more 
training places: a further 29 apprentices or students were taken 
on; 11 of them are women in industrial or technical occupations. 
At the end of 2011, Audi AG was training 2,349 apprentices and 
students in 22 professions, 2,225 in industrial or technical are-
as and 124 in commercial areas.
The German dual model of vocational training has now been 
adopted in many locations outside Germany, while others are 
developing the system. For example, Volkswagen Group Rus’s 
Kaluga plant put its second cohort into this training system in 
2011. Three new professional profiles – automotive painter,  
construction mechanic and production mechanic – have been 
added to the existing training professions (motor vehicle me-
chatronic technician and general mechatronic technician). In 
Volkswagen’s Indian plant in Pune, a three-year training pro-
gramme for mechatronic technicians based on the dual model 
was launched in 2011. In the future, more than 100 apprentices 
who have been trained at state Industrial Training Institutes as 
welders, painters, fitters, electricians, tool and machine main-
tenance technicians, vehicle mechanics or automation special-
ists will be guided through a year-long practical experience 
each year. In the USA, meanwhile, the second cohort of 20 ap-
prentices at Volkswagen in Chattanooga have begun training as 
motor vehicle mechatronic technicians in a programme run 
jointly�with�the�local�partners,�the�Tennessee�Technology�Cen-
ter and the Chattanooga State Community College. Also, a mod-
ern training centre has been built at Volkswagen Navarra in 
Pamplona, which will be opening in spring 2012. Building this 
training centre and Volkswagen’s commitment to training are 
recognised�in�this�part�of�Spain�as�a�major�contribution�to�so-
cial responsibility by the Company.
The focus of Volkswagen’s vocational training is to develop 
technical skills, but apprentices also benefit from a wide range 
of additional training programmes and events. In Germany, 
these include cooperation between Volkswagen’s vocational 
training division and “Jugend gründet”, a nationwide online 
business/high-tech competition offering a prize for the best 
product or business idea. The Company also organises the 
“ProTalent” and “ProMechaniker” competitions, which offer 
apprentices and students within the Volkswagen Group an op-
portunity to combine their technical talent with their passion 
for motor sport.
It’s not all about work on the factory floor or in the back office, 
though. For more than 20 years, Volkswagen apprentices have 
been involved in the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum. Volks-
wagen sends four groups of apprentices to Auschwitz each year 
to spend two weeks working with young Poles at the Memorial 
and Museum. The groups are briefed and supervised by the In-
ternational Auschwitz Council and our subsidiary, Volkswagen 
Coaching GmbH. Almost 2,000 young Germans and Poles have 
so far taken part in this programme. Volkswagen AG’s sustaina-
ble pedagogical and political commitment to the scheme is rec-
ognised across the world, and at the General Works Council’s 
suggestion, it broadened its involvement in the Memorial and 
the International Youth Meeting Centre in Auschwitz in 2008. 
As a result, four groups of managers, management trainees and 
supervisors now take part in a four-day seminar there each 
year, also overseen by the International Auschwitz Council.
Volkswagen is also nurturing particularly talented vocational 
trainees in talent groups for young specialists. These groups are 
an invaluable tool to support technically and intellectually gift-
ed employees as they make the transition from training to pro-
fessional work. Talent groups have been in place at all Volks-
wagen AG sites and at Volkswagen Financial Services AG since 
the end of 2010. 203 talented young employees embarked on this 
two-year development and skills training programme in De-
cember 2011, and 71 employees have so far completed it.
Since 2006, on completion of their training, young people at the 
start of their career have also had the opportunity to take part in 
the� “Wanderjahre”� (years� abroad)� programme;� the� name� al-
ludes to the tradition among newly-qualified craftsmen of trav-
elling the world and gaining experience. Participants spend 
twelve months at one of the Group’s international locations. So 
far, over 270 young employees of the Volkswagen Group have 
taken up this opportunity to gain their initial work experience 
outside their home country. In 2011, twelve participants came 
from locations abroad to gain a year’s experience in Germany, 
while 50 participants from Germany travelled abroad. 23 Volks-
wagen Group companies in 16 countries now participate in the 
“Wanderjahre”�programme.
Outstanding apprentices in the Group are given special recog-
nition each year when the Group Board of Management and the 
Group Global Works Council present the “Best Apprentice 
Award” to the Group’s top trainees. The 2011 ceremony – the 
eleventh – was held in Stuttgart in late November 2011, and 
awards were presented to 27 former apprentices representing 
twelve countries. For five Volkswagen Group companies – Auto-
15,021
apprentices were employed across  
the Volkswagen Group at the end of 2011.

Initial and in-service training of Meister (foreman/group lead-
er) is a particular priority for the Volkswagen Group. Meister 
qualifications are currently being adapted to uniform world-
wide standards. As part of this initiative, Basic Meister Qualifi-
cation was offered at a number of locations for the first time in 
2011. This programme prepares the Meister of tomorrow for the 
responsibilities they will face. In the Pune plant in India, a total 
of 39 Meister completed their qualification in three courses, 
adding to the 49 who completed it the previous year. The Kaluga 
plant in Russia organised seven Basic Meister Qualification 
courses in 2011, training around 100 employees. The Chattanoo-
ga plant also launched its Basic Meister Qualification in 2011.
Volkswagen prepares its future supervisors for their leadership 
role by means of Basic Leadership Qualification training, fol-
lowed by an examination. Both elements are being rolled out 
across all Group companies: the Pune and Kaluga plants began 
implementing the system in 2011, and Volkswagen in Poznan 
completed implementation in the same year. Employees’ devel-
opment into management roles is supported by the manage-
ment selection process, which was further developed in 2011: in 
a comparative discussion with the relevant specialist depart-
ment, management candidates are selected on the basis of their 
technical competencies, while their entrepreneurial skills are 
assessed in a Company-wide Management Assessment Center. 
This system enables the specialised departments to take a high 
level of responsibility for the selection of their own manage-
ment trainees within a Company-wide selection process.
The Group also has a broad range of tailored skills development 
opportunities for other professions. Volkswagen Coaching 
GmbH is Volkswagen AG’s central in-service training provider 
and offers employees a wide spectrum of training measures, in-
cluding HR development programmes, crossfunctional semi-
nars and courses, as well as specialised training programmes 
geared to the specific requirements of individual “Berufsfamil-
ien”. This ensures that each employee is able to develop his or 
her skills on an individual and tailored basis. The systematic 
development of the workforce is also promoted in relation to 
the goals set by the Company and its specialised departments. 
During 2011, more than 70,900 employees received in-service 
training in 8,232 seminars organised by Volkswagen Coaching 
GmbH, making a total of 198,547 participant-days. In the area of 
specialist skills development (e.g. factory automation, robotics 
and applications engineering or management), 48,817 employ-
ees were involved in 6,286 seminars over 139,290 participant-
days. Meanwhile, in the field of “crossfunctional skills develop-
ment” 
(which 
includes 
leadership 
skills 
and 
personal 
development), 22,133 employees attended 1,946 training cours-
es, representing 59,257 participant-days. 423 new programmes 
and courses were developed over the course of the reporting 
mobilmanufaktur Dresden GmbH, Volkswagen Osnabrück 
GmbH and Volkswagen Motor Polska, along with Shanghai-
Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen from China – this was the 
first time that their best apprentices had been among the 
award-winners. 
developing every employee
Individual personnel development includes cultivating employ-
ees and giving them the opportunity to acquire and enhance 
new skills. Volkswagen offers every employee this opportunity 
within “Berufsfamilien” (vocational groups). A “Berufsfamilie” 
includes all employees with related specialist skills who work 
together regardless of their level of experience or development. 
Learning and teaching involves the Company’s own experi-
enced employees offering their expertise within the framework 
of both tried-and-tested and innovative training formats. This 
ensures that learning processes are more geared to the specific 
processes and technical skills requirements of a particular 
“Berufsfamilie” than in conventional training programmes and 
enables knowledge to be transferred in the most efficient and 
tailored way.
In 2011, this model of cooperative learning was established in 
further areas of the Company: more and more divisions are set-
ting up “Berufsfamilien” and their own academies, in which 
the development of skills is organised. For example, the Pro-
curement Academy provides mentoring, talks from experts, and 
materials for self-study at the workplace. From the beginning, 
employees receive practical knowledge of the topics relevant 
to their “Berufsfamilie”. The creation and development of 
“Berufsfamilie” academies means that sites outside Germany 
are increasingly involved in this skills development model.
A “Components Academy” has been set up, for example; the 
academy’s structure and manpower will be reinforced in 2012. 
Competency centres combine Components, specialist knowl-
edge and that of other departments; thereby creating knowl-
edge databases. This competence development strategy means 
that Volkswagen in collaboration with the Works Council takes 
responsibility for its employees and safeguards employment. 
Over the last five years, strengthening the Components division 
has enabled Volkswagen to combine competencies and open up 
new technological fields, like electric traction, thixomolding 
and dry machining. 
year to ensure that the Company’s in-service training provision 
continued to meet its needs.
Volkswagen is also launching and developing training acade-
mies and training centres to meet the high demand for initial 
training, skills training and skills transfer, especially in new lo-
cations. The training academy that opened at the Chattanooga 
site in 2010 expanded its capacity when the Volkswagen plant 
there began operating in May 2011. Tried-and-tested Volks-      
wagen Group HR development tools, including the Basic Lead-
ership Qualification and the Management Assessment Center, 
have been adopted in Chattanooga. In spring 2011, Shanghai 
Volkswagen in China began building a training centre for its 
Yizheng�factory�in�addition�to�the�existing�centre�at�the�Nanjing�
location. The new FAW-Volkswagen site in Foshan is currently 
also being equipped with a training centre.
The Global Labour Charter
Skills development is also central to the further development  
of employee participation at locations outside Germany. The 
Volkswagen Global Labour Charter, which came into force in 
autumn 2009, combines rights to consultation with shared re-
sponsibilities, requiring employees to demonstrate first-class 
skills and a highly developed sense of responsibility. The Char-
ter applies globally and provides for phased rights to informa-
tion, consultation and codetermination for employee repre-
sentatives of the brands, companies and locations represented 
on the Group Global Works Council.
Since then, many locations have begun to flesh out the Charter 
with declarations of intent and outline implementation ar-
rangements agreed between management and employee repre-
sentatives. In 2011, the plant-level codetermination rights laid 
down in the Charter were developed and enhanced, with the 
first-ever general Company meetings and symposia being held 
in many locations outside Germany. In some cases, the work of 
local employee representatives is now being coordinated or de-
veloped within special committees, ensuring that the participa-
tion rights set out in the Charter are made more effective.
A good example of how the culture of cooperative action at  
Volkswagen is implemented internationally is the “Employee-
Friendly Employer” award given to Volkswagen Poznan in October 
2011. This national award was presented by the President of Po-
land�and�accepted�jointly�by�representatives�of�the�Board�of�Man-
agement in Poznan and the local trade union, Solidarnosc.

Career prospects for graduates
Since 1998, some 2,000 students who have demonstrated out-
standing technical and personal abilities during their intern-
ships at Volkswagen have been included in the Student Talent 
Bank, Volkswagen’s HR development programme for university 
students. Volkswagen supports and nurtures these former in-
terns while they complete their studies with events such as spe-
cialist presentations, seminars or visits to Volkswagen sites, 
building ties with talented students in the process.
In 2008, Volkswagen launched the StartUp Direct programme 
to give university students a head start in the Company. Over a 
two-year period, participants in the programme not only work 
in their own department and familiarise themselves with the 
Company but also have an opportunity to attend supplementary 
training seminars. The programme also includes placements of 
a few weeks in production and sales as well as an optional for-
eign placement. University graduates with an international fo-
cus may opt for the StartUp Cross programme instead. This 
18-month international programme includes a three-month in-
ternational placement. Over 1,400 trainees have acquired their 
initial experience with Volkswagen on one of these two pro-
grammes since they were launched in 2008.
The Student Talent Bank, the two StartUp programmes and a 
range of further, linked measures make Volkswagen in Germa-
ny very attractive to students: in May 2011, the Company won the 
“Employer Branding Award”, presented for the best marketing 
to universities. Volkswagen intends to intensify this area in fu-
ture to ensure that, on the way to becoming the world’s leading 
automobile manufacturer, it is able to recruit and retain top 
graduate talent. The Škoda brand is also using innovative mar-
keting tools to recruit up-and-coming talent as well as more ex-
perienced staff: against the backdrop of the Company’s strategy 
for growth and increasing globalisation, its film “Curriculum 
Vitae”� is� a� specific� tool� for� recruiting� graduates� for� projects�
abroad and in vehicle development. The creative strengths of 
the film were recognised when, in May 2011, it was awarded the 
“Deutscher Werbefilmpreis”, a prestigious award for filmed 
commercials. Meanwhile, to make itself even more attractive as 
an employer, Škoda has redesigned its Assessment Centre, 
which advises and supports potential employees.

THE AuTOuNI
The Autouni
Volkswagen AutoUni ensures that the Group has access to spe-
cialist�knowledge�and�research�expertise.�It�works�in�conjunc-
tion with individual departments within the Group and partner 
universities to offer in-service training tailored to the needs of 
the “Berufsfamilien”. The AutoUni has eight institutes, which 
between them offer a wide range of lectures, conferences, sem-
inars and, more recently, cooperative study modules at univer-
sity level. These cooperative study modules cover technical sub-
jects�in�detail,�and�participants�take�a�final�examination�at�the�
end of each module. In 2011, one particular focus of these mod-
ules was electric traction, in which 159 employees received fur-
ther training. Programmes run by the AutoUni, which is based 
in Wolfsburg, have been expanded internationally over recent 
years. The study module International Financial Reporting 
Standards was, for example, made available in both English 
and�German�to�employees�in�the�Chinese�joint�ventures�in�2011.
Almost 12,700 participants attended 200 AutoUni events in 2011. 
One third of these events took place outside the Company’s 
Wolfsburg headquarters. As part of Volkswagen’s regional out-
reach, about 40 percent of the events were open to the general 
public. For example, a series of public lectures on the theme of 
corporate social responsibility not only tackled cultural history 
aspects and current issues but also explored and discussed 
whether the impact of sustainability measures can be measured 
in economic terms.
Over and above this, the AutoUni is intensively involved in the 
Group’s doctoral student programme, in which over 400 doc-
toral students were supervised in 2011 by the various companies 
within the Volkswagen Group in Germany. All these doctoral 
students work on ambitious PhD thesis topics with relevance 
for the Company. Under the doctoral student programme, stu-
dents typically complete their thesis within three years, during 
which time they work closely with their own department in the 
Group, which also appoints a supervisor from within the Com-
pany. Completed theses may be published as part of the Auto-
Uni’s publication series.
The AutoUni’s cooperation with partner universities was sub-
stantially expanded in 2011. In October 2011, Volkswagen AG en-
dowed a Chair of Human Resource Management at the Techni-
cal University of Braunschweig, and the Company also helped 
the institution to deepen its expertise in economics and busi-
ness education, in particular by arranging a series of lectures 
on “Strategic Human Resource Management within Company 
Leadership”. In China, meanwhile, Volkswagen and Shang-
hai’s�Tongji�University�intensified�their�long-standing�coopera-
tion. Volkswagen has already endowed two Chairs at the Univer-
sity and added a third in 2011, a Chair in Human Resource 
Management at the Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg 
(Sino-German University College). The Company also promotes 
the� Dual� Master� Program� run� jointly� by� Tongji� University� and�
the Technical University of Braunschweig. This programme en-
ables ten Chinese students a year to study for a dual master de-
gree in automotive engineering and mechanical engineering in 
Shanghai and Braunschweig on a programme including two in-
dustrial placements in Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg factory. These 
initiatives are boosting Volkswagen’s attractiveness as an em-
ployer in China and also helping to meet the skills shortage 
there. In China, 1,000 graduates from partner universities were 
selected and hired out of more than 70,000 applications in 2011.
promoting performance and sharing profits
The Volkswagen Group sees its wide range of in-service training 
and skills development provision as a key part of its develop-
ment of a top team. The systematic fostering and recognition of 
good performance is another key part of our strategy, along 
with redesigning our pay systems to ensure that employees have 
a sustainable share in the success and profits of the Company.
Since 2010, Volkswagen AG has had detailed standard criteria for 
skills development and performance assessment. These criteria 
cover the entire workforce, from apprentices to top managers, 
and are underpinned by concrete incentive systems within the 
pay structure. The pay system for Volkswagen AG employees cov-
ered by collective agreement comprises three main components:
The AutoUni has eight institutes, which between them offer a wide range of 
lectures, conferences, seminars and, more recently, cooperative study modules 
at university level.
>  Basic pay in the form of each employee’s monthly salary.
>  An entitlement to profit-sharing, which is laid down by collec-
tive agreement; 10 percent of the Volkswagen brand’s operat-
ing profit is channelled into profit-sharing.
>  Performance-related components in force since early 2011, 
which represent an additional reward for individual perfor-
 mance.
As part of the introduction of a performance-related pay compo-
nent, Volkswagen AG and its unions have agreed that each em-
ployee should have an annual individual appraisal with his or her 
line manager. This appraisal has two elements: performance as-
sessment and development planning. Each employee is given 
feedback on his or her performance and clear guidance on ca-
reer prospects. Recognising and valuing good performance is 
just� as� important� in� this� context� as� individual� potential� or� any�
specific further training needs. 2011 was the first year in which 
the entire workforce was appraised. Volkswagen AG supervisors 
showed enormous commitment in carrying out 82,221 apprais-
als, with a further 4,158 appraisals using the same criteria being 
carried out within Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Volks-
wagen Immobilien Service GmbH. The successful rollout of  
appraisal means that over 86,000 employees now receive indi-
vidually determined performance-related pay components.
In February 2010, the Company and the German metalworkers’ 
union IG Metall also agreed that the collective agreement on 
sustainable location retention and employment protection 
would remain in force until at least December 31, 2014, giving 
all Volkswagen AG employees employment security until that 
date. The Innovation Funds set up at the initiative of the Gener-
al Works Council, and governed by the same collective agree-
ment,�represent�a�major�contribution�to�safeguarding�employ-
ment. Since 2007, Innovation Fund I has helped to further 
develop existing skills areas at the various Volkswagen loca-
tions. Innovation Fund II, by contrast, began operating during 
the reporting year and was set up to fund the development of 
new areas of business across the automotive value production 
chain� and� beyond.� The� fund’s� major� emphasis� is� on� sustain-
ability, with a view to long-term employment protection and 
creation.�Its�funding�is�focused�on�promising�projects,�such�as�
the recycling of testing equipment or the use of gravity-based 
conveyor systems.
82,221
appraisals were carried out in  
Volkswagen AG in 2011.
The agreement also stipulates that there will be no reduction in 
the recruitment of apprentices until December 31, 2014, and 
that�apprentices�will,�subject�to�performance,�be�taken�on�per-
manently on completion of their training. The decision is based 
on the model used to assess Volkswagen apprentices and on 
their performance in the examination run by the chambers of 
industry and commerce. Former apprentices who meet specific 
performance criteria will be given permanent employment with 
Volkswagen AG. Former apprentices who do not meet these cri-
teria will initially be offered a fixed-term, two-year contract. Af-
ter two years, the performance assessment from the annual in-
dividual appraisal forms the basis of the decision as to whether 
to take them on permanently. The standard criteria for perfor-
mance assessment create clarity and consistency for every em-
ployee in his or her professional development.
The pay system, which now includes a performance-related 
component, has proved effective in enabling employees to 
share in Volkswagen AG’s success. It also helps to ensure fair 
pay and reward individual performance while preserving com-
petitiveness. The three components of the pay system are being 
rolled out across the Group and form the model for collective 
agreements concluded outside Germany. Over 35 such agree-
ments were negotiated across Volkswagen Group locations in 
2011 and bargaining was underpinned in all cases by an active 
information and communication process. A local dispute cul-
minating�in�a�vote�for�strike�action�arose�at�just�one�location�but�
was resolved by agreement between management and the local 
union.
Management employees also earn part of their salary in the 
form of a personal performance bonus, which rewards individ-
ual performance. The Company bonus enables management 
staff to share in the success of their own part of the Company. 
Since 2010, the Long Term Incentive (LTI) has been available in 
addition to other bonus components. The LTI is calculated over 
a four-year period, making it a long-term management remu-
neration tool that reflects the positive and sustainable develop-
ment of the Company. This means that it complies with the aims 
of the 2009 legislation on remuneration of Board of Manage-
ment members but is applied more widely, to the whole of  
Volkswagen’s management worldwide. The Long Term Incen-
tive is linked directly to the goals set out in the Group’s Strategy 
2018 and rewards Volkswagen management for their contribu-
tion to implementing the Strategy’s goals of attaining top em-
ployer status and leading the field in terms of customer satisfac-
tion, sales and profitability. In this way, the LTI helps ensure 
that Volkswagen management consistently pursues the multi-
dimensional and sustainable goals set out in the Company’s 
stakeholder strategy.

EMpLOyEE OpINION SuRVEy STATEMENTS
In order to consistently provide even more intense support and 
tailored development to its employees in the long term, Volks-
wagen is reorganising its personnel management in collabora-
tion with the specialised departments and the Works Council. 
Knowing each individual employee and his or her talents, the 
HR specialist is an important sparring partner for the manag-
ers and works in an atmosphere of mutual trust with the Works 
Council as well. Both sides gain from this collaboration: the 
Company has a motivated and productive workforce, while in-
dividual employees can be deployed in a way suited to their per-
sonal qualifications and fitness. At Volkswagen, personnel 
management means, among other things, leading people re-
sponsibly, developing staff into a top team, and giving each em-
ployee the opportunity to produce excellent performance.
Employee opinion survey
The employee opinion survey is a proven and extensively used 
tool to involve employees actively in what is going on in the 
Company. Employee satisfaction is measured each year using 
the Volkswagen Group’s employee opinion survey, which is 
standardised and covers the entire workforce. Once the survey 
is� complete,� the� findings� are� jointly� discussed� by� supervisors�
and employees, a process that raises complaints and problems 
on the one hand and suggestions for improvements to work pro-
cesses on the other. Improvements agreed upon are then imple-
mented before the next year’s survey.
The employee opinion survey was conducted for the fourth time 
in 2011. It covered 77 corporate locations and companies in 26 
countries, and over 308,000 employees took part out of a possi-
ble 346,000, a response rate of 89 percent. The 2011 survey 
showed an improvement on the previous year. More than 60 
percent of employees saw the employee opinion survey as  
a “useful” or “very useful” tool for improving their work. Re-
spondents also considered that discussion of the results helped 
the teams and organisational units to achieve sustainable im-
provements to employee satisfaction at work.
The “Volkswagen Way”
The “Volkswagen Way” is another tool that relies on the com-
mitment of the workforce for its success. It is aimed at the com-
prehensive optimisation of all Company processes. The core of 
the “Volkswagen Way” is a process of continuous improvement 
(German abbreviation as KVP) which aims permanently to de-
velop productivity and efficiency as well as communications, 
teamwork and leadership. Since the “Volkswagen Way” came 
into force in 2007, Volkswagen employees have been receiving 
training in how to identify and eliminate waste. In 2011, the 
main focus was on optimising processes, in particular in rela-
tion to product quality and quality of work. By involving the 
workforce, different departments within the Company have 
been able to explore potential for improvement and increased 
not only the quality but also the stability of their processes.
The other brands within the Volkswagen Group have similar 
programmes for boosting efficiency. For example, all brands 
across the Group are now using a standardised production sys-
tem. Using the KVP cascade system – a tiered approach to 
change – standardised methods are being used to optimise pro-
cesses and structures both in production and non-production 
areas right across the operation and across all sites.
Ideas management
Volkswagen sets great store by enabling its employees to make 
suggestions for improving work organisation and production 
processes. Employees’ suggestions and ideas are considered 
and assessed centrally in the Volkswagen “Ideenmanagement” 
unit, which is represented at all the German sites. The first sug-
gestion scheme at Volkswagen was introduced back in 1949, and 
employee commitment to improving products and processes 
has since become a key measure of the workforce’s creativity, 
expertise and motivation. Volkswagen also offers training and 
skills development to systematically promote a culture of ideas 
within the Company. The continual improvement process set 
out in our Company agreement, “The Volkswagen Way”, is also 
supported by the ideas management process, which equips 
managers with a vital tool for managing and motivating employ-
ees.
In 2011, Volkswagen employees across the Group submitted a to-
tal of 475,073 suggestions for improvement, 21.2 percent more 
than in 2010 (391,880). Adopting 340,960 of these suggestions 
The employee opinion survey asks employees to give their views on 11 state-
ments. This involves them actively in what is going on in the Company.
>  Volkswagen is viewed positively in pub-
lic and by friends and acquaintances.
>  I’m well informed about current devel-
opments at Volkswagen.
>  Sufficient steps are being taken to ensure 
quality in our organisational unit (OU).
>  Flaws or disruption in the work process 
are quickly resolved in our OU.
>  Collaboration in my OU/group is good.
>  Collaboration with colleagues from 
other OUs/groups is good.
>  Collaboration with my direct super- 
visor is good.
>  I can deal comfortably with performance 
pressure and work-related demands.
>  I like my job as it is.
>  I like working for Volkswagen.
>  Our OU benefited from discussing the  
results of the employee opinion survey.
over the reporting period helped substantially to drive up the 
quality of our products and the efficiency of our processes, re-
ducing costs in the Group by a total of €325.5 million. Bonuses 
worth some €32.7 million were awarded to staff whose ideas 
were adopted in acknowledgement of their creativity and in-
volvement in the life of the Company.
The ideas management process also helps to make working at 
Volkswagen both safer and healthier. The challenges of demo-
graphic change are given a high priority, with special consider-
ation given to suggestions for ergonomic improvements. The 
suggestions adopted are generating continuous improvements 
in occupational health and safety, and in 2011, 5,432 suggestions 
for improvement related solely to safety at work, of which 2,400 
were adopted.
Demographic change
Volkswagen continued to push forward a wide range of meas-
ures for ergonomic improvement in 2011. Ergonomic improve-
ments across the entire product development process ensure 
that workplace quality and the stress and strain on employees 
caused by production processes are taken into account at the 
planning and design stages. After hosting an initial conference 
of the German Institute of Ergonomics in Wolfsburg in Septem-
ber�2010,�in�2011�the�Company�joined�forces�with�the�Technical�
University of Chemnitz to develop the framework for its inte-
grated ergonomic strategy based on the triple elements of peo-
ple,� technology� and� organisation.� The� joint� aim� is� to� draw� on�
research and scientific knowledge to combine state-of-the-art 
ergonomic workplaces with innovative working processes.
In cooperation with Volkswagen’s manufacturing plants, inte-
grated approaches to good ergonomic design of workplaces and 
working processes are being developed. Examples of good prac-
tice are being adopted in other plants, and against the back-
drop of demographic change, it has been agreed that each  
Volkswagen location will organise an Ergonomics Day once 
each year. Volkswagen Poznan in Poland has, in fact, so far held 
two such days, in April and October 2011, at which working 
groups discussed fields of action for designing ergonomic work-
places and working hours, as well as changes to health manage-
ment, staff deployment planning, HR development, and team-
building. 
A number of Volkswagen AG plants took an important step to-
wards reducing the impact on health of shift work by reorganis-
ing shift patterns. The reorganisation has drawn particularly on 
research findings relating to shift design and adapted these to 
the needs of the automotive industry. Medical experts favour 
forward-rotating shift patterns with frequent changes, because 
short-cycle patterns facilitate the body’s transition from one set 
of working hours to another: the forward-rotating shift pattern 
mimics gradually lengthening days and so is more in line with 
human biorhythms than a pattern that mimics shortening days.
> At the Wolfsburg plant alone, more than 18,000 employees 
moved in early 2011 to shift patterns that imposed less stress 
on their health. Over the course of the year, other Volkswagen 
AG�locations�also�made�appropriate�adjustments�to�their�shift�
patterns.
> Shift patterns are agreed with the Works Council and their 
impact is then assessed using employee feedback. These find-
ings form the basis for further improvements to shift organi-
sation and processes for introducing new shift patterns.
>  A two-shift pattern is now in operation particularly for em-
ployees with performance impairment. These employees now 
work an early and a late shift in alternate weeks and are no 
longer required to work night shifts.
Volkswagen AG is particularly committed to helping employees 
with reduced capacity or disabilities. People with disabilities 
made up 6.67 percent of the total workforce of Volkswagen AG in 
2011, once again well above the statutory 5 percent quota. Volks-
wagen orders goods from workshops for people with disabili-
ties, which also helps to improve employment prospects for the 
disabled outside the Company. During the reporting year, these 
orders totalled almost €23 million.
Over recent decades, Volkswagen mobility aids have also helped 
to give people with disabilities greater independence and au-
tonomy. The Company directly supplies a comprehensive range 
of driving aids for its vehicles and offers a 15 percent discount 
475,073
suggestions for improvements were submitted across 
the Group in 2011. 340,960 ideas were adopted, 
earning their originators some €33 million.

on Volkswagen special vehicles. Special features available in-
clude rotating and swivel seats, manually operated accelerator 
and brake controls, an EDAG automatic wheelchair loading de-
vice, and the FRANZ hands-free driving system. These aids can 
be fitted to virtually all Volkswagen cars, from the Polo to the 
Touareg.
Work2Work is a key programme across all our plants and creates 
new�job�opportunities�for�employees�with�performance�impair-
ment. 2011 marked the tenth anniversary of the programme’s in-
troduction in the Wolfsburg plant, and Work2Work’s success has 
been underpinned by constant improvements to the programme. 
Over the past ten years, some 1,600 employees have benefited 
from the scheme, and around 700 people are now employed in 
Wolfsburg in 89 different fields of activity that have been adapted 
to their specific capacity. One of Work2Work’s aims is to reinte-
grate� employees� who� have� suffered� illness� or� injury� into� Volks-
wagen’s production and specialist departments, and it already 
has over 400 successes to its credit. The Company knows that 
many performance-impaired employees have talents and exper-
tise that can be developed with targeted support. Once these 
skills are identified, it is often possible to move the employees 
concerned�to�a�different,�but�high-quality,�job�within�the�Compa-
ny. Work2Work is based on three principles – personal responsi-
bility, independent initiative and solidarity – and the Company 
intends to continue it and to make further improvements.
The Group’s social responsibility commitment also earned rec-
ognition in its international operations. In 2011, for example, 
Škoda was acclaimed for its exemplary policy of employing peo-
ple with disabilities or with reduced capacity. The Company won 
two prestigious awards in the Czech Republic, the “Employer 
without Barriers” and “Most Responsible Company” prizes, for 
its wide-ranging measures to provide employment for those 
with disabilities and in particular for its six sheltered work-
shops that employ over 200 people with disabilities at the Škoda 
production plants in the Czech Republic. Working closely with 
OS KOVO, the local trade union, Škoda has created new employ-
ment prospects for employees whose health is impaired.

Staying fit, healthy and safe
Healthy, capable and competent employees are crucial to top 
performance and to enabling Volkswagen to boost its market 
position and competitiveness. Protecting and promoting good 
health� is� therefore� not� just� a� social� responsibility� and� part� of�
Volkswagen’s corporate culture, but is also vital to the Compa-
ny’s ongoing economic health and viability.
Volkswagen has for many years taken an integrated approach to 
health management and this was extended and widened in 2011. 
The Volkswagen Checkup, a high-quality, comprehensive medi-
cal examination and advice session available to all employees, 
was introduced in 2010. Its aim is to help maintain and improve 
the health, fitness and performance of all employees. All Volks-
wagen AG plants now offer the Volkswagen Checkup on a regu-
lar basis, using state-of-the-art procedures. Employees appreci-
ate the high diagnostic quality of the Volkswagen Checkup, with 
more than 28,000 Volkswagen employees having so far taken 
advantage of the scheme on a voluntary basis. A similar scheme, 
the Audi Checkup, has been running since 2006 and has been 
taken advantage of almost 43,700 times, including some 5,800 
follow-up measures.  In 2011 alone, over 8,000 employees took 
an Audi Checkup. Following the successful introduction of the 
Checkup in plants in Germany, the Company’s priority in 2011 
was to broaden the range of both internal and external preven-
tive health measures linked to the scheme. Furthermore, the 
rollout of the Volkswagen Checkup started across many Group 
Company pension plan
Volkswagen AG, all its brands and all its subsidiaries run 
Company pension schemes to ensure that former em-
ployees have a source of income in retirement. In Germa-
ny, these are direct pension commitments. In addition to 
these employer-funded pensions, employees can also 
build up their own pension provision through a salary 
conversion scheme. Since 2001, payments to Volkswagen 
AG’s Company pension scheme have been invested in the 
capital markets by the scheme, which is administered in 
trust by the Volkswagen Pension Trust e.V. At the end of 
2011, 21 other Group companies in Germany were also us-
ing these arrangements. At year-end 2011, the Company’s 
pension fund had total assets of €2,589 million for em-
ployees’ retirement and disability pensions and death 
benefits.
Since 1998, Volkswagen AG’s Time Asset Bond has offered 
employees the chance to bring forward their retirement 
age by making contributions from their gross salary or 
their working time credits. Their contributions are invest-
ed in the capital markets by the Time Asset Fund, which 
is administered in trust by the Volkswagen Pension Trust

locations abroad. For example, during the reporting year, Volks-
wagen de México’s Puebla plant opened a modern health cen-
tre, which will now be offering around 4,000 Volkswagen 
Checkups a year to employees free of charge. 2011 also saw  
Volkswagen continue its international commitment to combat-
ing infectious diseases, for example through measures to com-
bat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

Assistance and mentoring opportunities for employees with 
mental health or psychosomatic problems and help with reha-
bilitation were also expanded in 2011. Among other measures, 
employees with health problems have access to psychological 
support and specific consultation arrangements for psychoso-
matic diseases. A tailored rehabilitation programme has been 
developed to reintegrate employees after serious and/or long-
term� illness,� offering� early� intervention� and� job-related� sup-
port. Evaluation of the arrangements by medical experts has 
endorsed the contribution this scheme makes to reintegrating 
employees into the working process. Efforts also continue to 
improve ergonomics in all workplaces. Deploying ergothera-
pists to production lines has enabled employees to access advice 
and�guidance�in�situ�on�how�to�do�their�jobs�more�ergonomically.�
Further improvements to the workplace management system 
have made it a tool that helps workplace profiles to be reconciled 
with the deployment options of individual employees, taking 
health and strain factors into account.
As part of management development, supervisors in the Com-
pany are being made aware of the need to take greater account 
in�the�way�they�do�their�job�as�managers�of�the�links�between�
leadership and employees’ health. A basic seminar has been 
designed to help them to do this, and compulsory skills modules 
on occupational safety have also been developed and intro-
duced for all trainee managers. On the basis of the Group’s oc-
cupational safety management system (KAMS) which was intro-
duced in 2010, all Group brands and companies also carried out 
a comprehensive analysis in 2011 of the way they organise occu-
pational safety and the processes involved. Examples of good 
practice identified across the Group are being systematically 
integrated into improved occupational safety processes. 2011 
also brought further success in reducing the number and sever-

programme since 2009, and this is also helping to reduce the 
frequency of accidents and the resulting negative impact.
Advancing women and promoting diversity
At Volkswagen, both career and family life are considered ex-
tremely important, which is why the Company is redoubling its 
efforts to create a family-friendly environment. For Volkswa-
gen, family-friendly HR policies are one of the keys to becoming 
a top employer. This commitment has a long track record: in 
1989,�Volkswagen�was�the�first�major�German�company�to�for-
mulate guidelines on advancing women, underpinned by tai-
lored programmes. As early as 2007, Volkswagen AG had set 
specific targets for increasing the proportion of women in the 
Company. In spring 2011, the Volkswagen Group set differenti-
ated targets within the framework of voluntary undertakings to 
achieve sustainable growth in the proportion of women work-
ing for the Company in Germany. These measures represent a 
systematic approach by Volkswagen to setting specific targets 
for all relevant levels in the Company’s hierarchy and time-
scales for their achievement. This differentiated approach puts 
Volkswagen on course to promote equality of opportunity in a 
way that is realistic and makes business sense.
Quotas for graduate recruitment are a key tool. Volkswagen 
takes as its starting-point the proportion of female graduates in 
each discipline, so that, for example, around 10 percent of all 
mechanical engineers it recruits should be women. For electri-
cal engineering, the proportion is also 10 percent, rising to 15 
percent for information technology and to 50 percent in busi-
ness areas. When all the disciplines relevant to Volkswagen’s 
work are averaged out, differentiated quotas produce a recruit-
ment target of at least 30 percent female graduates.
Volkswagen makes links with female students early in their aca-
demic careers to persuade them of the attractions of the engi-
neering professions. From 2012, it will be working with univer-
sities to offer a six-month placement for female students with 
the Abitur (Germany’s school-leaving examination), designed 
to encourage young women to take up courses in such areas as 
mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, vehicle tech-
nology, and mechatronics. Since 2004, the Company has been 
running the “Woman DrivING Award”, aimed at the best female 
engineers from these disciplines. The competition is held 
across Germany every two years and is designed to encourage 
young female graduates into employment in technical areas 
where they can contribute to designing and producing the cars

of tomorrow. Entries for the fourth award open to female en-
trants in spring 2012.
Having�a�higher�proportion�of�skilled�women�joining�the�Com-
pany is helping to secure a steady increase in the proportion of 
women managers at various levels of management over the next 
few years. The aim is that by 2020, 11 percent of all top managers 
in the Volkswagen Group in Germany will be women. For senior 
management, the target is 12 percent; for management, it is 15 
percent. Since 1998, Volkswagen has offered a mentoring pro-
gramme aimed at increasing the proportion of women in man-
agement positions. Having been through 19 cycles with a total of 
well over 300 participants, this is a recognised development 
programme in the Group. 45 women took part in the Volks- 
wagen AG Mentoring-Programme in 2011.
Volkswagen is also aiming to increase the proportion of female 
skilled workers and Meister to at least 10 percent by 2020. To 
help it achieve this goal, the Company has for more than five 
years supported talented female skilled workers with a tailored 
mentoring programme designed to help them to progress to 
Meister grade. In 2011, 25 women were supported by the Volks-
wagen AG Meisterinnen-Mentoring-Programme.
Women accounted for 26.4 percent of all apprentices in 2011, in-
cluding 20.4 percent of apprentices in industrial or technical 
areas. This means that the Volkswagen Group in Germany has 
one of the highest proportions of female apprentices of any au-
tomotive company in the country. The Company wants to in-
crease the proportion to nearer 30 percent, however, and is ac-
tively seeking to recruit talented women. The tools it is using 
include special information days on industrial or technical vo-
cational training at Volkswagen and hands-on experience days 
for young women. For the past eleven years, the Company has 
taken part in a national initiative, “Girls’ Day”, and during the 
reporting year, it offered more than 2,000 female school stu-
dents practical insight into the careers offered by the automo-
tive industry.
HR development programmes for women, measures to help 
them combine work and family, and flexible working time mod-
els support Volkswagen’s system of differentiated quotas. Meet-
ings for employees on parental leave, initiatives to ease the 
transition back to work after parental leave, information on 
childcare providers on the intranet, and telecommuting op-
tions�make�it�easier�to�balance�job�and�family�at�Volkswagen.
Social responsibility
Volkswagen is particularly active in exercising its social respon-
sibility by promoting regional growth initiatives in the areas 
where it operates. Wolfsburg AG, a public-private partnership 
between the Company and the town of Wolfsburg set up in 1999, 
takes a leading role here. Since 2009, it has been partnering 
with another organisation to form the “Allianz für die Region” 
or Regional Alliance; its partner, the “Region Braunschweig 
GmbH”�project,�takes�in�the�towns�of�Wolfsburg,�Braunschweig�
and Salzgitter and the surrounding rural areas as well as re-
gional businesses. The aim of the Alliance is to focus skills and 
resources for regional development more effectively, and the 
main goal of the collaboration is to develop structures centred 
on�creating�and�safeguarding�jobs�and�improving�the�quality�of�
life. In addition to a broad range of measures to promote busi-
ness, the initiative also contributes towards educational, 
health, leisure and energy goals. By improving local facilities 
for residents and businesses, the Alliance is boosting a sense of 
well-being and identity and making the area more attractive as 
a business location and to skilled workers. Networking with ed-
ucational and research bodies and supraregional partners, 
along� with� implementation� of� inspirational� pilot� projects,� are�
also pointing the way to new approaches to sustainable regional 
development. The work of the Alliance has been continued and 
expanded in 2011, with a wide range of new initiatives.
Volkswagen is also actively involved in education in the region. 
The�“Neue�Schule�Wolfsburg”�project,�an�initiative�designed�to�
set up a new school in Wolfsburg in partnership with the town 
and local businesses, opened its doors in August 2009. The pri-
mary and secondary school, which is open to all children from 
the town of Wolfsburg and the surrounding region, designs its 
curriculum around five key themes: a strong international  
focus, science and technology, business, the arts, and the pro-
motion of talent. The school’s mission was developed by an in-
ternational panel of experts and is delivered by 42 committed 
teachers who work closely with business and educational experts 
and a wide range of extramural institutions. In the current 
(2011/2012) school year, the school has 382 students in years 1 to 3 
and 5 to 7 (those aged between 6 and 8 and between 10 and 12).
But Volkswagen wants to support the older members of society 
as well as the youngest. Several thousand Volkswagen employ-
ees retire each year, and the Company’s HR policy is to support 
them as they make the transition from employment to retire-
ment. About two years before they are due to retire, older em-
ployees take part in events facilitated by HR staff to help them 
move smoothly into this new phase in their lives. They are told 
about volunteering opportunities, for example working in 
schools to help children with reading or as learning support as-
sistants. A Group-wide “Senior Expert” scheme was established 
to provide this service across all locations. Former employees 
are offered the opportunity to pass on their skills and experi-
ence to others, whether at regional, national or international 
level, for example by teaching technology and maths in schools 
or by helping to train specialists and management staff. Since 
the� project� began� in� September� 2010,� some� 180� retirees� have�
signed up with the Senior Expert scheme.
Active employees are also often keen to do voluntary work, and 
Volkswagen supports its employees as they take up or carry out 
voluntary roles. The “Volkswagen Pro Ehrenamt” (Volkswagen 
Supports Volunteering) initiative is a highly successful clearing 
house, linking community initiatives looking for volunteers 
with Volkswagen staff wanting to help in a social capacity.  
“Volkswagen Pro Ehrenamt” works not only within Volkswagen 
AG locations but also in the surrounding regions in partnership 
with some 680 organisations and bodies. The core aim is to 
boost the profile of volunteering in the public perception, and 
support for volunteering has become firmly embedded in the 
Group’s sustainability strategy over the past few years. 
In 2011 alone, line managers had more than 500 debriefings 
with volunteers that highlighted the value of social responsibi-
lity and skills development outside narrow technical areas. 
Since�the�project�was�set�up�in�late�2008,�it�has�registered�over�
2,800 volunteer openings and placed some 1,200 volunteers. 
The idea behind “Volkswagen Pro Ehrenamt” has already been 
adopted by Group subsidiary AutoVision GmbH, and the plan is 
to roll it out at other Group companies. 
As well as giving their time and talents, Volkswagen employees 
also show sustainable commitment to charitable giving. For 
several decades, the Company has operated an employee dona-
tion scheme to benefit those in need in the areas in which it op-
erates, and employees have supported it generously. In Wolfs-
burg alone, employees donated over €400,000 in 2011 to support 
social welfare organisations. The Company also demonstrates 
its social responsibility through its recently-created founda-
tion, the “Volkswagen Belegschaftsstiftung” (Volkswagen Em-
ployees’ Foundation). This body, set up by Volkswagen AG in 
2011,� is� intended� to� support� social� projects� benefiting� socially�
disadvantaged children and young people across all Group loca-
tions, with a particular emphasis on vocational training. The 
Board of Management and the Board of Trustees took up their 
posts�during�the�reporting�year.�They�have�decided,�in�conjunc-
tion with the Volkswagen Belegschaftsstiftung’s cooperation 
partner, the children’s and adolescents’ charity “Terre des 
Hommes”, to develop a vocational training centre for socially 
disadvantaged young people in India. The centre is due to begin 
operating in 2012.
Fairtrade
At the suggestion of the General Works Council, Volkswagen 
has been selling Fairtrade products in its catering facilities via 
its catering provider, Service Factory Gastronomie und Hotel-
lerie, since 1999. Fairly traded products help producers in de-
veloping countries to earn an independent and dignified liveli-
hood, and support for Fairtrade has been growing across the 
Group: an ever-wider range of products is available, and new 
sales stands and product information help raise awareness and 
boost sales. In 2011, for example, sales of Fairtrade coffee were 
13 percent up on the previous year, and in all, the Company 
bought 51 tons of coffee, beating the record of 49 tons set in 
2006.

commitment to social development and sustainability.

(hungary/germany)   
A joint research project by Audi, TU Munich and the state of Bavaria explores the CO2-binding poten-
tial of oak trees. Since 2009, 36,000 oaks have been planted in the vicinity of Ingolstadt. The project 
is being expanded to other Audi sites; 13,000 oaks have already been planted in Györ, Hungary.
Partners in Education 
(USA)         
In cooperation with regional universities and (technical) colleges, since 2008 Volkswagen Group of 
America has invested in the next generation of engineers – providing scholarships, organising 
workshops and conducting joint research projects.
MoMA Partnership 
(USA)  
Volkswagen launched a multi-year partnership with the Museum of Modern Art in New york in May 
2011. Since then, an international modern art exhibition has been developed and the online education 
programme expanded and made available worldwide. In addition, Volkswagen supports MoMA’s work 
by sponsoring artwork and exhibitions.
VSA Arts 
(USA)         
Every year Volkswagen Group of America honours the artistic achievement of young artists with 
disabilities with the VSA Arts award. This complements the Company’s diversity management 
activities. VWGoA has been working with Americans with disabilities for eleven years now.

After more than 125 years, the automotive industry is in the 
midst�of�major�changes:�across�the�world,�more�and�more�peo-
ple are moving into high-density urban environments, where 
land devoted to roads and parking must be used as efficiently as 
possible. And as the urban population grows, vehicle utilisation 
patterns are increasingly shifting from ownership to usage. City 
dwellers are showing a growing interest in inter- or multimodal 
solutions, i.e. solutions that allow users to choose the most ap-
propriate mode of transport for their requirements. Modern 
information and communication technologies can help make 
this decision easier. 
That said, for a large number of people around the world the 
desire to own a car, often for the first time, remains as strong as 
ever. At the same time, virtually everywhere, high environmen-
tal standards are expected. At the heart of the changes currently 
taking place is the emergence of electric drive. Far from being a 
solely technological phenomenon, electric drive has diverse 
implications – for the way we generate energy, for the transport 
infrastructure and for transport utilisation patterns. There has 
always been a fundamental conflict between the sheer popular-
ity of the automobile and the excessive strain this places on the 
environment and infrastructures. On the one hand it is true 
that mobility – the movement of both goods and passengers – is 
indispensable for a functioning and prosperous society. And it 
is also true that the resulting strong, and globally expanding, 
demand for vehicles (cars, trucks, buses) is the basis on which 
the Volkswagen Group operates and does business. On the oth-
er hand, however, the steady growth in the vehicle population 
and traffic density also results in undesirable side-effects for 
people, the environment and the climate. In many places, par-
ticularly in cities, the downsides include rush-hour congestion, 
accidents and adverse impacts on local communities. 
A car manufacturer aiming to promote sustainable mobility 
must not view mobility simply from a technology-centric, or 
car-centric perspective. Cars are components within complex 
systems, in particular mobility and energy systems. We aim for 
solutions in which our vehicles and services are optimally inte-
grated into these systems, or contribute to improving these sys-
tems. The aim of the mobility research carried out by Volkswa-
gen is to obtain a holistic understanding of automotive mobility 
within the wider context of alternative modes of transport, hu-
man settlement patterns, transport infrastructures, public poli-
cy, urban development and other factors. Mobility services like 
car-sharing or vehicle networking (V2X) technologies, for ex-
ample, are heavily influenced by trends within the overall mo-
bility system. 
Within the energy system too, the changes currently taking 
place have a variety of implications for our Company. Renewa-
ble energies open up huge opportunities, while at the same 
time also presenting multiple challenges, such as the need to 
construct new power lines, the problem of intermittent output, 
and issues such as development of smart grid solutions and sus-
tainable biofuels. In the “Audi balanced mobility” initiative, 
Audi is exploring ways of achieving carbon-neutral long-dis-
tance mobility. The aim is to use wind power to generate elec-
tricity which will either power electric vehicles directly or will 
be converted in an “e-gas” plant into hydrogen or synthetic nat-
ural gas. These gases could be used in future to power fuel-cell 
vehicles or Audi TCNG natural gas models. The Golf twinDRIVE 
research�project�too�has�a�strong�focus�on�integrating�the�vehi-
cle into the wider energy landscape. Meanwhile, in Berlin, the 
Volkswagen� Group� will� be� taking� part� in� the� project� Effizien-
zhaus Plus, which is aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of 
sustainable living and carbon-neutral driving. An Audi A1 e-tron 
and two Volkswagen Golf Blue-e-Motion models will be partici-
pating.

In 2011 the Volkswagen Group intensified its dialogue with criti-
cally-minded specialist institutions and experts. In workshops, 
personal discussions and conferences, we got together with sci-
entific, political and urban and regional planning stakeholders 
to discuss challenges, solutions and practice recommendations. 
The Audi Urban Future Initiative is an open forum to develop new 
perspectives for the sustainable city of the future, based on the 
synergy between mobility, architecture and urban planning. The 
conclusions� and� insights� generated� by� the� project� “pillars”� –�

also on intensive discussions with local authority urban mobility 
planners from Berlin, Hamburg, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Lon-
don, the Ruhr District and Zurich. We also hold continuous dis-
cussions with partners in the World Business Council for Sus-
tainable Development (WBCSD), of which we are a member, on 
the�subject�of�future�sustainable�mobility.�In�all�these�dialogues�
we get the impression of a high willingness on the part of urban 
stakeholders to discuss and test innovative solutions, in collabo-

Mobility services
The Volkswagen Group is taking a systematic and strategic ap-
proach to the development of mobility. Our strength lies in our 
ability to offer the combined expertise of vehicle experts from 
the brands and services experts from Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG. Our mobility products range from small cars to 
buses and heavy-duty trucks, which can be purchased, leased or 
rented as required. The range of vehicles and services will be-
come even more diverse in future. Increasingly, special-pur-
pose models will be offered alongside the multi-purpose vehi-
cles�of�today.�If�every�journey�were�carried�out�with�the�vehicle�
most�suited�to�the�purpose�of�that�journey,�transport�efficiency�
would be significantly enhanced. Conceivably, in the long term, 
customer demand for more flexible vehicle utilisation could 
lead to a situation where from case to case vehicles would be in-
dividually selectable at very short notice and usable for a very 
short period for a very specific purpose. During the year under 
review, in cooperation with Volkswagen Financial Services, the 
Volkswagen brand took its first step in this direction with the 
launch of the car-sharing service Quicar. The scheme was 
launched in Hanover in November, with a fleet of Golf BlueMo-
tion models, which are available for pick-up and hire at various 
city centre locations. To use the scheme, customers must first 
complete a simple one-off registration process either online or 
via a smartphone. In addition to the short-term rental fleet, fur-
ther “Quicar Plus” models are also available for longer periods, 
upwards of one day. Quicar is a service which makes personal 
mobility possible, using highly eco-friendly models, for all 
those customers who don’t need to own a car. 
  31
For companies with large fleets or large workforces, Volkswa-
gen Financial Services also offers vehicles for long-term rental, 
for periods ranging from one to 12 months. Commercial fleets, 
for whom eco-efficient operation is becoming more and more 
important, are a further important stakeholder in new mobility 
concepts. The year under review saw Volkswagen Leasing GmbH 
and the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union 
(NABU) successfully continue their cooperation on environmen-
tal and climate protection. The 77 participants in the second 
“DIE GRÜNE FLOTTE” (THE GREEN FLEET) environmental 
award saved 1,650 tons of CO2� and� just� under� 630,000� litres� of�
fuel, with approximately 9,200 vehicles.

Mobility research
Mobility research and stakeholder dialogues also reveal, howev-
er, the economic and institutional challenges involved in de-
signing integrated, one-stop mobility concepts. The increasing  
customer demand for integrated all-in-one urban mobility in-
corporating various different modes of transport creates a need 
for action by many different stakeholders and a “system integra-
tor”. For example the necessary road and rail infrastructures 
must be put in place. Another requirement is to ensure that pub-
lic transport services are attractively located and that they run at 
convenient times. Four- and two-wheel vehicles must be made 
available at attractive urban locations and at attractive prices. 
Volkswagen is committed to playing an active role in this process. 
For example it is taking part in Lower Saxony’s bid to be involved 
in the national showcase programme “Schaufenster Elektromo-
bilität”,�amongst�other�things�with�a�project�on�intermodal�trans-
port including a “mobility map”. 
  32
Our main business is vehicle manufacturing. Our responsibili-
ty for sustainable future mobility is therefore centred mainly on 
our products. In 2011, Volkswagen significantly expanded its ex-
tensive range of eco-efficient models. New models included the 
Volkswagen up! Just 3.54 metres long and with low CO2 emis-
sions, this four-seater is an ideal solution for affordable, sus-
tainable urban mobility. Another example is the SEAT Mii. Its 
emissions�are�just�97�g/km�CO2 for the Ecomotive version and 
just�86�g/km�CO2 for the future CNG/natural gas version, mak-
ing the SEAT Mii one of the most efficient vehicles in the world. 
Škoda too presented a highly eco-friendly solution during the 
year under review: the Citigo. 
One aim of the Volkswagen Powertrain and Fuel Strategy is to 
exploit the full potential of conventional internal combustion 
engines. Parallel to that, this strategy is also focused on expand-
ing our range of plug-in and full-hybrid vehicles. Volkswagen 
sees these models as a stepping stone on the way to an “electric 
age” of battery and fuel cell-powered vehicles.
Volkswagen is aiming to play a leading role in electric mobility 
by 2018. So the roadmap is clear. And a number of milestones on 
this map have already been achieved. In 2011, electrically pow-
ered cars from various parts of the Volkswagen Group took part 
in field trials. Since electric mobility involves big challenges for 
vehicle development and production, we shall be setting up 
competence centres to bring together our expertise in the fields 
of electrical systems, electronic systems and electric drive, at 
various special locations. We are also heavily involved in efforts 
to develop sustainable solutions for energy storage and for the 
integration of vehicles into the power grid. And obviously, green 
electricity needs to be available too, since electric vehicles are 
only genuinely carbon-neutral if they are operated on renewa-
ble power. 
Looking further ahead, completely new mobility solutions may 
well emerge. Concept vehicles developed by Volkswagen Group 
Research are already pointing the way. The electric eT! van, for 
example, (see page 10) is a postal delivery vehicle designed to 
meet the needs of businesses operating in city centre areas. The 
Volkswagen brand’s “NILS” concept is a mobility solution for 
commuters. This electric vehicle is a lightweight (460 kg) elec-
trically powered single-seater car. Both vehicles illustrate the 
potential for developing mobility solutions for very specific ap-
plications. 
  33
The NILS concept car from the Volkswagen brand shows what the commuter vehicle of the future could look like.  
And in Hanover the Quicar project demonstrates how simple and convenient car-sharing can be.
Vehicle safety
Sustainable mobility also means safe mobility. Volkswagen is 
working to improve vehicle safety with the aid of new technolo-
gies, materials and production processes, as well as through its 
work in the field of road safety education. The next step is to 
meet the EU goal of halving road accident fatalities by 2020. In 
the course of 2011, Volkswagen further improved and “democra-
tised” its safety technologies – in other words, as well as im-
proving mid-range and luxury-class vehicles, the Volkswagen 
Group is also making it a top priority to ensure that its future 
compact and sub-compact models benefit from state-of-the-art 
safety technologies too. 
The Volkswagen up! is the first car in its class to feature an op-
tional City Emergency Braking system, which is active at speeds 
of up to 30 km/h and ideally will apply the brakes automatically 
if the driver fails to notice a risk of collision. The new Škoda Ci-
tigo meanwhile is the first Škoda to offer head-thorax side air-
bags for driver and front passenger. In a further example, the 
SEAT Alhambra is equipped with seven airbags, including a 
driver-side knee airbag. As well as stability systems and elec-
tronic Brake Assist, this vehicle is also equipped with a tyre 
pressure monitoring system and Mobility Tyres, designed to 
maintain mobility after a puncture. 
Volkswagen safety systems help to reduce reaction times and 
help drivers spot hazards sooner. If an accident proves unavoid-
able, the active safety systems respond pre-emptively, in order 
to�reduce�the�risk�of�damage�and�injury�for�the�vehicle’s�occu-
pants and for other road users. The active safety systems are 
backed up by an optimally designed passive safety system com-
prising a highly deformation-resistant passenger cell, defined 
front and rear crumple zones and safety-optimised interior de-
sign. This high level of all-round protection, and the systematic 
integration of state-of-the-art safety technologies into all vehi-
cle classes, is reflected in the large number of awards and priz-
es Volkswagen picked up in 2011. 
  34
In the course of the year, Volkswagen also achieved new mile-
stones in its development work on safety technologies of the  
future.� In� the� framework� of� the� European� research� project� 
INTERACTIVE (Accident avoidance by active intervention for 
Intelligent Vehicles), Volkswagen presented an accident mitiga-
tion system which also incorporates the possibility of steering 
intervention. The intervention takes place at a point in time 
when the driver can no longer avoid an accident, but when it is 
still�possible�to�reduce�the�extent�of�damage�and�injury.�A�fur-
ther� flagship� project� in� which� Volkswagen� is� taking� part� is�
simTD.�The�aim�of�this�joint�project�is�to�develop�solutions�for�
V2X – vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure – com-
munication which would allow important safety-relevant infor-
mation – for example about upcoming roadworks or congestion 
– to be transmitted direct to the driver’s vehicle via UMTS- or 
WLAN-based�systems.�In�its�work�for�this�project,�Volkswagen�
Group Research has developed various new functions. For ex-
ample these functions can assess the current traffic situation in 
the area around the vehicle’s present position, visualise it using 
traffic webcams and combine this information with current 
weather data. Then there is the “intersection assistant” which 
can significantly improve safety when the driver is approaching 
a poor-visibility intersection. Because real-world mobility dif-
fers so much from country to country, Volkswagen has estab-
lished its own accident research centre in China, with the aim 
of adapting Western knowledge in this field to the specific re-

Eye-catching looks for an urban lifestyle: the Audi urban concept.
Rush hour – sustainably relaxed…
Here’s a good idea for sustainable mobility Swedish 
style: since the end of 2011, some 200 employees at 
truck maker Scania have regularly covered the 35 kilo-
metres between 
Stockholm and  
the factory in 
Södertälje in com-
fort-class shuttle 
buses supplied  
by the company. 
Instead of experiencing the frustration of gridlock or 
travelling by train, they spend the trip enjoying a freshly 
brewed cup of coffee, reading the paper or surfing the 
Web via a high-speed link. And thanks to all the car 
trips this saves, CO2 emissions are reduced as well.

gional requirements. In the Czech Republic too, the Group has 
set up a Škoda accident research team and developed a Škoda 
regional research programme. The ultimate aim, of course, is 
to make accident investigation unnecessary altogether through 
accident prevention. And in view of the importance of road  
safety�education,�not�just�for�children�but�also�for�adults,�Volks- 
wagen is taking action in this area too, where it is sponsoring a 
road safety programme – “The Seventh Sense” – for Chinese 
television. The programme is based on the format of the popu-
lar German TV series of the same name.

driver assistance systems
Driver assistance systems enhance driver comfort and conveni-
ence. In many vehicles of the Volkswagen Group, such systems 
proactively identify critical driving situations and take the nec-
essary pre-emptive action, for example to prevent loss of grip. 
The Volkswagen brand’s active lane-keeping system Lane As-
sist, for example, helps to prevent accidents due to unintended 
lane departures. And if the lane departure is intentional, the 
Side Assist system can warn the driver of a vehicle hidden in the 
blind spot. The drowsiness monitor advises drivers when it’s 
time to take a break; in many vehicles ACC automatic distance 
control, which helps the driver maintain the correct distance 
from the vehicle in front, also features Front Assist with City 
Emergency Braking function. Front Assist Ambient Traffic 
Monitoring detects hazards in front of the vehicle, primes the 
brake system for emergency braking, warns the driver and if 
necessary initiates automatic partial braking. In addition, inno-
vative lighting systems like Dynamic Light Assist adapt the 
headlamp beam pattern to the traffic situation. In 2011, Volks-
wagen added to the range of driver assistance systems available 
for its current vehicle range, while continuing its vigorous re-
search efforts. Future vehicles will not only be more aware of 
their surroundings, they will also be able to communicate with 
other vehicles. New assistance systems will also be able to help 
drivers when they are under-stimulated due to monotonous 
driving situations, or conversely when they are experiencing 
overload in complex and unclear situations. For assistance sys-
tems in general, design of the interface between user and tech-
nology is becoming an increasingly important factor in ensur-
ing that the driver always maintains a full overview. We are 
therefore conducting extensive research into driver behaviour, 
to establish how assistance systems are experienced by the driv-
er in practice, and how the ideal system should be designed. 
The general principle that applies to all driver assistance sys-
tems from the Volkswagen Group is that they must provide driv-
ers with useful assistance, but never attempt to take responsi-
bility away from them or to take full control of the vehicle. This 
applies even in the case of semi-automated driving. On this top-
ical issue Volkswagen presented the “Temporary Auto Pilot” sys-
tem�at�the�final�event�of�the�EU�research�project�HAVEit�(Highly�
Automated Vehicles for Intelligent Transport). Monitored by the 
driver, this system can pilot the vehicle semi-automatically on 
motorways, at speeds of up to 130 km/h. The system marks a fur-
ther advance on the assistance systems of today and a further 
step towards the vision of fully automated driving. 
  37, 
  38
The combination of a growing vehicle population and a limited 
road infrastructure presents a challenge, particularly in towns 
and cities. Appropriate scaling  of the road and transport infra-
structure is therefore a central theme of the debate on sustain-
able transport. Regardless of where that may lead, we are  
seeking to ensure more efficient usage of the existing road in-
frastructure by equipping our vehicles with traffic assistance 
systems. Traffic assistance systems are driver assistance sys-
tems that promote efficient and congestion-free navigation and 
driving. To ensure that the growing number of cars does not au-
tomatically mean more congestion, appropriate traffic infor-

mation is required, allowing optimal vehicle routing and traf-
fic-synchronised driving in heavy or stop-go traffic. On the 
technical basis of state-of-the-art driver assistance systems and 
future inter-vehicle communication based on vehicle-to-vehicle 
and vehicle-to-infrastructure networks, we are developing in-
novative assistance systems which will bring significant im-
provements in traffic flow. In the framework of the research 
project�KOLINE,�a�system�for�traffic-synchronised�longitudinal�
vehicle control, i.e. speed management, is being developed on 
the basis of WLAN communication between vehicles and traffic 
lights. The first simulations show that time spent stopped at 
traffic lights, and the resulting environmental impacts, are sig-
nificantly� reduced,� and� journey� times� shortened.� As� with� our�
Roadworks�Pilot�project�(2010�research�project)�to�direct�driv-
ers� through� motorway� roadworks,� this� project� has� confirmed�
that smart driving strategies implemented by an intelligent, 
V2V-equipped vehicle can have the effect of significantly in-
  creasing existing road capacity, with benefits for all road users.
 
  39
Micro-mobility
Urban micro-mobility, comprising both short urban trips and 
last-mile solutions, is a further important development field at 
Volkswagen. Here too, a number of solutions were presented in 
2011, including the Volkswagen e-Scooter. The main compo-
nents of the e-Scooter concept, which will be rolled out initially 
on the Chinese market, are fleets of high-performance e-Scoot-
ers in urban areas, plus an innovative rental and charging sta-
tion infrastructure. This concept, which will also incorporate 
e-Scooter apps for smartphones, is designed to provide flexible 
urban mobility. The e-Scooter is the latest in a range of urban 
micro-mobility solutions which also includes the “Kickstep” 
and the battery-powered “Bik.e” electric bike. 
With all these concepts, research activities and developments, 
Volkswagen is developing its vision of future mobility. Within 
this vision, the car will remain a key mode of transport. Howev-
er, particularly in urban core areas, provision of additional mo-
bility solutions will encourage more frequent switching to alter-
natives such as buses, rail or two-wheeled transport. Customers 
will expect tailor-made transport solutions and, as far as possi-
ble, a seamless mobility chain. Road transport itself will be eco-
efficient or even emission-free. Electric vehicles will be inte-
grated with the power grid. In some cases, future vehicles will 
operate fully automatically, making optimal use of the limited 
infrastructure – both when driving and when parking. Acci-
dents will be virtually eliminated, and assistance systems will 
support or even take over driving tasks. Close cooperation be-
tween vehicles and traffic lights will reduce the time vehicles 
spend waiting at lights, which in turn will reduce environmen-
tal�impacts�and�journey�times.�New�vehicle�concepts�tailored�to�
very specific mobility requirements, and optimally integratable 
into the wider public/private mobility system, will add to the 
range of options. Meanwhile, the digital world of tomorrow will 
also be available in-car. Cars will communicate and cooperate 
with other vehicles and with alternative modes of transport, 
leading to increased multi-modal mobility and improved over-
all transport efficiency. Services such as car-sharing, rental or 
logistics services will round off the transport picture, thereby 
ensuring that the mobility of tomorrow offers greater overall di-
versity, efficiency and sustainability.
Experience electromobility 
Visitors to the Autostadt in Wolfsburg can really “hit 
the power” as they take a free, 30-minute or so test 
drive in and around Wolfsburg in one of the fleet of 
Golf Blue-e-Motion models that await them. The cars 
are charged with green power from Volkswagen’s 
own power utility, Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH, 
generated in hydroelectric plants in southern Germa-
ny and Switzerland. Along with this opportunity for 
hands-on experience, the topic of electromobility 
also features in the exhibition “LEVEL GREEN – the 
idea of sustainability”. In this permanent exhibition 
at the Autostadt, visitors can obtain comprehensive 
insight into topics such as the production and Life 
Cycle Assessment of an electric car, power generation 
and supplies, and the innovative technology on 
board the Golf Blue-e-Motion. In its educational of-
fering for young people, the Autostadt also covers as-
pects such as how batteries work.

Environment-friendly 
front-runner. 
The Volkswagen Group is about to embark upon a fundamental ecological restructuring programme. Over two 
thirds of the capital expenditure planned for the period up to 2016, amounting to over €62.4 billion, as well as 
an additional €14 billion to be invested together with partners in China, will be channelled into more efficient 
vehicles, powertrains and technologies, as well as into environmentally compatible production at our plants 
around the world. 
Environmental management
At Volkswagen, the environmental aspects of sustainability are 
viewed as central strategic management tasks. Such tasks are 
handled for example by the central Energy Management function. 
This function ensures that all plants use energy as efficiently and 
sustainably as possible. It is developing and implementing a long-
term strategy to increase the proportion of renewables in our  
energy mix. The central Environmental Management function 
meanwhile ensures that all aspects of environmental sustainabil-
ity are integrated directly into the Group’s Environmental Policy. 
The main pillars of this Policy are the Group Environmental Prin-
ciples governing our products and production operations, which 
apply worldwide.  
  40,  
  41,  
  42
The Corporate Environmental Steering Group, reporting di-
rectly to the Board of Management, safeguards the long-term 
value of the Company and protects it against environmental 
risks. 
Since 1995, our German sites have participated voluntarily in 
the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), making 
Volkswagen the first automaker to get involved in this program, 
while our Group sites worldwide have participated in environ-
mental certification processes in accordance with the interna-
tional standard EN ISO 14001. The environmental management 
system of the Volkswagen Technical Development department 
has held EN 14001 certification ever since 1996, and DIN ISO/TR 
14062 certification since 2009. Recertifications to these various 
standards have confirmed our pioneering role. For example, 
significant environmental aspects are identified at an early 
stage and integrated in the product development process. We 
also take environmental considerations into account at all stag-
es of the product life cycle. 
  43
Regular meetings of the environmental officers of the Group’s 
European plants have been taking place ever since 1976. To en-
sure that Volkswagen’s Environmental Policy is integrated into 
the production processes of our plants throughout the world, 
regular Regional and Group Environmental Conferences are 
held. The aim is to synchronise the work of all plants world-
wide, and to implement concrete environmental action plans at 
local level. In 2010, Regional Environmental Conferences took

set to become the new environmental front-runner in the autumn of 2012.
place at the Anchieta (Brazil) and Pacheco (Argentina) sites. A 
further such conference was held in 2011 at the Puebla plant in 
Mexico. Here an environmental action plan was drawn up with 
the aim of significantly enhancing energy efficiency as well as 
the effectiveness of local water resource management. In 2012, 
the 5th Group Environmental Conference will take place in 
Wolfsburg. The next Regional Environmental Conference is 
scheduled for May 2013, and will take place in China. Intro-
duced in 1995, the Factory Agreement on Environmental Protec-
tion motivates employees to integrate the principles of environ-
mental protection into their everyday work. To ensure that 
sustainable practices are implemented in all parts of the organ-
isation, many sites have a network of specially trained environ-
mental specialists. They assist the environmental officers and 
help to give environmental protection a broad foundation “on 
the ground”. At the Wolfsburg plant, Works Council members 
too receive training on climate-related, energy and environ-
mental issues to ensure they are well qualified for their impor-
tant role as multipliers and advisors on sustainable practices. 
Two series of training courses were held in 2011, and two more 
will�be�held�in�2012.�There�are�plans�to�extend�this�project�to�all�
the other Volkswagen plants in Germany as well.  The Volkswa-
gen brand’s Internal Environmental Award, which in 2011 was 
presented for the eighth time, is an important management in-
strument in engaging employees and motivating sustainable be-
haviour. The purpose of this award is to commend eco-friendly 
production processes, materials and products which have al-
ready proved their worth in practice. Amongst other things, the 
award-winning solutions in 2011 resulted in an annual reduc-
tion in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the 
Braunschweig site from 490 g/litre to 154 g/litre, and reductions 
in CO2 emissions and freshwater consumption at the Salzgitter 
plant of 963 tons and 1,340 m³ respectively. At the Poznan plant 
in Poland meanwhile, employees developed an ingenious sys-
tem for reducing hazardous waste, which also achieves cost sav-
ings of €65,000 a year.

Life Cycle Assessments
Volkswagen analyses the environmental impact of a vehicle over 
its entire life cycle, including development, production and re-
cycling, as well as the vehicle’s service life. Not only internal but 
also external factors are taken into consideration, from the ini-
tial idea through raw material production to energy require-
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ments for recycling. Volkswagen evaluates this data and, on the 
basis of the results, produces comprehensive Life Cycle Assess-
ments (LCA) for vehicles, components and processes in accord-
ance with ISO14040/44. These Life Cycle Assessments enable us 
to analyse the environmental impact of our vehicles and reduce 
it in a targeted way. Our aim is to ensure that each new model 
developed presents better environmental properties than its 
predecessor over the full life cycle – and is between 10 and 15 
percent more efficient on average. 
In order to make this progress clear to customers, since 2007 
Volkswagen has been using Environmental Commendations to 
document the environmentally compatible development of new 
models. These Environmental Commendations consist of Life 
Cycle Assessments certified by TÜV Nord. The basic concept of 
Performs well in practice: an Audi A1 e-tron gets a recharge during fleet trials in Munich.
the Environmental Commendations was completely revised in 
2011. The main change was the decision in favour of a modular 
publication approach. The system is now based on a 24-page bro-
chure presenting basic information on the reasons for, back-
ground to and methods of Environmental Commendations. The 
basic brochure is supplemented by shorter brochures for specif-
ic products. In addition, as part of an evaluation process, dealers, 
NGOs and customers were asked for their views and wishes re-
garding the content of Environmental Commendations. This re-
sulted in generally positive feedback, as well as a number of sug-
gestions which Volkswagen will be taking up in future with a view 
to improving the communication concept. In 2011, apart from the 
new Volkswagen up!, new Environmental Commendations based 
on this concept were issued for the highly economical Passat 
BlueMotion and Passat EcoFuel models from Volkswagen. In the 
case of the Environmental Commendation for the up!, for exam-
ple, it was shown that greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 
21 percent compared with the Volkswagen Fox, which served as 
the reference model. Digital versions of all Environmental Com-
mendations and further information can be downloaded from 
environmental-commendation.com.

percent of Passat and Sharan models sold in 2011 were equipped 
with these packages. And we are now fitting these technologies 
as standard features on all newly launched models. 
  47
These technologies bring important environmental benefits for 
key account customers too. For the Volkswagen Group as a whole, 
average CO2 emissions of vehicles sold to key account customers 
in the first half of 2011 stood at 136 grams per km, according to a 
study by the Frankfurt market research institute Dataforce. For 
the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, the corresponding figure 
was 127 g CO2/km, well below the EU’s 2015 target of 130 grams 
CO2/km. For this brand, emissions from vehicles delivered to key 
account customers have been below the EU guideline since 2006.

Volkswagen’s Powertrain and Fuel Strategy is focused on further 
improving powertrain efficiency and on sustainable – and as far 
as possible carbon-neutral – fuel production. The long-term aim 
of the strategy is carbon-neutral, sustainable mobility, based on 
the continued coexistence of electric drive and the conventional 
internal combustion engine. Accordingly, in 2011 further mile-
stones were achieved for both types of powertrain.
As far as conventional internal combustion engine powertrains 
were concerned, Volkswagen achieved new benchmarks during 
the year under review. The development and rollout of an all-new 
generation of three- and four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines 
took another leap forwards, one highlight being the market 
launch of the new up! The petrol engines for the up! have output 
ratings of 44 kW/60 hp and 55 kW/75 hp and are Euro 5-compli-
ant. The average fuel consumption of the BlueMotion Technology 
versions is 4.2 l/100 km (60 hp) and 4.3 l/100 km (75 hp). Both 
these 1.0-litre engines emit less than 100 g CO2/km. 
Life Cycle Assessments are likely to become even more important 
in connection with the growth of electromobility, which will re-
sult in a shift in the sources of environmental impacts. With an 
internal combustion engine, the exhaust emissions produced 
during� vehicle� use� are� a� major� factor� in� the� vehicle’s� environ-
mental impact. With electric vehicles, by contrast, it is the emis-
sions produced during the upstream process of power generation 
that will be decisive. While an electric car emits virtually no car-
bon dioxide during operation, most electricity is still generated 
using fossil fuels. “Green” power generation for electric vehicles 
will be an essential element in attaining carbon-neutral mobility.
Life Cycle Assessments will help identify new scope for optimisa-
tion. This makes them a key environmental management tool 
which will contribute to achieving Volkswagen’s environmental 
policy�objectives�in�the�era�of�electromobility.�Work� on� the� Life�
Cycle Assessments for the Golf Blue-e-Motion, which is to make 
its debut in 2013, got off to a successful start in 2011.
When it comes to the analysis and methodology of Life Cycle As-
sessments, Volkswagen attaches considerable importance to reg-
ular dialogue with other companies and institutions. This was 
one reason why Volkswagen was a co-organiser of the 2011 Life 
Cycle Management Conference in Berlin.

Efficient powertrains & fuels  
The most effective way for a car manufacturer to reduce its envi-
ronmental impact is by improving the efficiency of its products, 
i.e. its cars. The Volkswagen Group is an industry leader on fuel 
efficiency. Democratisation of its efficiency technologies and 
their rollout in the various brands’ volume-production models 
continues to make steady progress. The Volkswagen brand is 
also committed to improving the overall environmental perfor-
mance of its products from one model generation to the next.
On this basis, 2011 saw further big advances. Fleet-average emis-
sions for Volkswagen Group vehicles in 2011 stood at 136.9 g CO2 
per kilometre (EU27), an improvement of 7 grams over 2010. 
The Volkswagen Group offers 281 different model versions with 
emissions of less than 130 g CO2/km (2010: 220), including 151 
which emit less than 120 g CO2/km – 35 more than the previous 
year. 26 models actually emit less than 100 g CO2/km – 6 more 
than in 2010. Technologies such as start-stop and braking ener-
gy recuperation have been widely introduced in current produc-
tion models. The Volkswagen brand has steadily increased the 
number of models for which such BlueMotion Technology pack-
ages are available as straightforward add-on extras. Almost 90 
The Volkswagen Group is making eco-friendly technologies available in 
more classes of car, as documented by the increasingly widespread pres-
ence of low-emission models.

Derivatives of the new engine family have also been fitted in the 
Audi A5 since September 2011. And with the launch of the mod-
ular transverse matrix (MQB), further new engines are set to 
follow. They will set new standards of sustainable engine design 
with innovations such as needle bearing camshafts, combined 
direct�and�port�injection�and�the�integrated�exhaust�manifold.�
With the modular diesel engine system (MDB), the Volkswagen 
Group is also poised to introduce an all-new generation of 
three- and four-cylinder, diesel engines, which will first be un-
veiled in the new Audi A3 in 2012. 
A further example of an efficient conventional powertrain solu-
tion is provided by the Passat BlueMotion, the most fuel-effi-
cient Passat of all time, which was presented at the 2011 Geneva 
Motor Show. Thanks to its standard-fitted start-stop system, re-
cuperation, low rolling-resistance tyres and ultra-aerodynamic 
bodywork, the saloon version of the 77 kW/105 hp 1.6-litre tur-
bodiesel�(TDI)�model�achieves�fuel�consumption�of�just�4.1�l/100�
km – corresponding to CO2 emissions of 109 g/km. With the op-
timum driving style, this gives it a range of 1,707 kilometres 
without refuelling.  
The launch of cylinder deactivation by the Volkswagen brand in 
2011 marked a big leap forward in the drive towards greater fuel 
efficiency. Under low and medium load conditions, two of the 
four cylinders are temporarily shut down, reducing NEDC fuel 
consumption by 0.4 l/100 km. Potentially, depending on the 
driving situation, the saving may be as much as 1.0 litres. The 
system will debut in early 2012, in the new 1.4-litre TSI engine. 
At Audi, the Cylinder on Demand system, which deactivates four 
of the eight cylinders has been available for the S8, S7 and S6 
since 2011. From 2012, the system will also be available for the A1 
and A3 1.4 TFSI.
On hybrid technology too, which the Volkswagen Group sees as 
a stepping stone on the way to a future age of electromobility, 
Volkswagen set new milestones in 2011. In the United States the 
Volkswagen brand presented the Jetta Hybrid, which is due for 
European launch in 2013. Audi introduced hybrid-drive Q5 and 
A6 models in 2011, and in 2012 will introduce a similar concept 
for the A8. This will make Audi the first premium manufacturer 
to offer a hybrid model in the B, C and D segments. In parallel, 
Volkswagen is also working on plug-in hybrid technology, i.e. 
technology for externally chargeable full hybrid electric vehi-
cles. The Volkswagen brand presented 20 Golf Estate twin-
DRIVE models to the German Environment Ministry in Berlin 
for a fleet study. Road testing of the research prototype demon-
strates how smoothly the twinDRIVE concept combines zero-
emission, all-electric operation around town with the driveabil-
ity of a 116 hp internal combustion engine, which is ideal for 
longer distances. SEAT has also developed a prototype, the Seat 
Leon twinDRRIVE, which combines the power of a highly effi-
cient TDI engine with the smoothness and zero emissions of 
electric drive. 
Over and above the cars themselves, our commitment to effi-
cient powertrains and fuels also extends to various additional 
services which offer Volkswagen customers information on sus-
tainable mobility and ways to save fuel. As in previous years, we 
held numerous fuel-saver training courses and published infor-
mation�material�on�this�subject.��

Since 2011, under the slogan “Know more, consume less”, Volks-
wagen has been offering its customers in Germany a “BlueMo-
tion safety check”. In the course of this extended vehicle check, 
the Volkswagen service partner also checks the vehicle over for 
any issues which could cause unnecessary fuel consumption. In

Mandatory introduction of fuels with a higher biofuel content 
was taken into account from the outset in the technical design 
of Volkswagen’s current petrol engines. These engines are 
therefore capable of operating safely on E10. For owners of 
older Volkswagen vehicles, a list of E10-incompatible vehicles 
has been published. This list shows that only a small number 
of our vehicles are not capable of running on E10. 
  51
Volkswagen welcomes the development of advanced biofuels be-
cause such fuels, known at Volkswagen as SunFuel, have a higher 
greenhouse gas reduction potential across the entire vehicle life 
cycle than the biofuels of today. Volkswagen defines the term 
SunFuel as comprising pure biofuels and synthetically manufac-
tured fuels that meet the EU sustainability criteria, have a CO2 
reduction potential of 60 percent and over, and whose fuel quali-
ty is compatible with the powertrain technology of the present or 
the foreseeable future.
Efficiency brands
To give customers clear and transparent guidance when choos-
ing a product, some Volkswagen Group brands use “efficiency 
brands” to highlight their most sustainable vehicles. At Volks-
wagen, the efficiency brands form part of the “Think Blue.” 
philosophy,� although� this� philosophy� is� not� confined� just� to�
products and technologies. The Volkswagen efficiency brands 
comprise the labels BlueMotion (in each case the most fuel-effi-
cient Volkswagen models in their class), BlueMotion Technolo-
gy (with optional add-on efficiency packages), TSI EcoFuel (nat-
ural-gas powered vehicles which emit around a quarter less 
CO2 than similar petrol models) and  BlueTDI (models with  
special emission control technologies for very low nitrogen  
oxide emissions). At Škoda, extra-fuel-efficient models bear the 
GreenLine and GreenLine Technology badges, while SEAT uses 
the labels Ecomotive and E-Ecomotive. Audi equips its models 
with fuel-efficient technologies as standard. 
  52
Extra-fuel-efficient technologies are also used at the volume- 
selling end of the Volkswagen Group’s model range. For example 
the 1.2-litre TDI-engined Volkswagen Polo (2011: 62,200 units) 
emits�just�96�g�CO2/km, the 1.6-litre TDI-engined Audi A1 (23,400 
units) 101 g CO2/km, the Škoda Fabia 1.6l TDI (9,500 units) 109 g 
CO2/km and the 1.2-litre TDI-engined SEAT Ibiza (16,200 units) 
just�96�g�CO2/km. 
Demand for Volkswagen’s efficiency models is growing. Sales of 
such models grew more than twelvefold between 2007 and 2010, 
from 32,500 to 402,400 units, and 2011 saw a further increase. A re-
cord 764,137 extra-fuel-efficient vehicles were sold to European 
(EU27) customers. This growth was driven by increased customer 
demand for vehicles which offer high environmental standards 
without�compromising�on�driving�enjoyment.�Volkswagen�is�mak-
ing concerted efforts to meet this demand. For example in 2011, the 
Volkswagen brand increased the number of models for which a  
fuel-saving BlueMotion Technology package was available as a 
straightforward, attractively priced add-on extra from 49 (2010)  
to 54. At the same time, the number of models in which such tech-
nologies are already fitted as standard increased as well.

Emden in Germany, and in Brazil. It is also participating in vari-
ous partnerships to actively advance the expansion of renewable 
energies, and within the short to medium term will also be part-
nering with utilities that supply renewable power. In the long 
term, this could allow Volkswagen to offer green electricity as 
part of a complete package, together with the car, and so to be-
come an all-in-one supplier of zero-emission mobility. The Com-
pany’s portfolio would then include not only the vehicle, financ-
ing models and mobile online services, but also electricity “made 
by Volkswagen”. 
A further challenge is to create an extensive charging station in-
frastructure, and to develop harmonised standards, particular-
ly as regards connectors. For a successful rollout of electromo-
bility, this harmonisation must be global. This is a task not only 
for the automotive industry but also for energy companies and 
policymakers. 
A further decisive factor for electromobility is competitive pric-
ing. To lower the price of what are still very costly components, 
such as the battery, electric motor and power electronics, Volks-
wagen’s approach will involve standardising battery cell design, 
developing improved mass production technology and materi-
als and passing on the resulting cost savings to consumers. 
Today's electricity mix is largely based on the use of fossil fuels. So until the 
power required for electromobility is generated from renewables the poten-
tial of electromobility to reduce CO2 emissions remains very limited.

Electromobility 
In 2011, Volkswagen continued its preparations for volume pro-
duction of a variety of electrically powered Group vehicles. The 
Group’s first all-electric models – the Volkswagen Golf Blue-e-
Motion and the Volkswagen e-up!, along with electric vehicles 
developed specifically for the Chinese market – will go into vol-
ume production in 2013, while low-volume production of the 
Audi R8 e-tron supercar will start as early as 2012. Ahead of this, 
various field trials are currently taking place. For example the 
Golf Blue-e-Motion is being trialled in Germany, Europe, China 
and the USA, the Audi A1 e-tron in Germany and the Audi A3 e-
tron in the USA and China. In the Czech Republic, trials with 
the Škoda Octavia Green E-Line are already under way, and in 
Spain the prototype SEAT AlteaElectric is being tested.  
  53
But despite the current trials and future market launches, one 
thing is clear: it will still be years before electromobility can be 
introduced market-wide, to provide sustainable mobility for all. 
In the meantime, a number of challenges still have to be re-
solved, throughout the automotive industry. In particular, the 
issue of energy efficiency and energy storage has to be resolved, 
with a view to increasing the range of battery-powered vehicles. 
This�is�a�major�focus�of�Volkswagen’s�development�work,�par-
ticularly at its plants in Wolfsburg (development), Braunschweig 
(battery design), Kassel (electric motor design) and at the Elec-
tronics Research Laboratory (ERL) site in Belmont, California. 
Numerous alliances also exist with renowned battery manufac-
turers, while Volkswagen, Evonik Degussa and Chemmetall are 
jointly�sponsoring�a�battery�research�fellowship�at�the�Univer-
sity of Münster. But despite these provisos, the driving range to

no recharging infrastructure is available at the destination. For 
longer� journeys,� an� appropriate� option� would� be� plug-in� 
hybrids, which can operate both all-electrically and on an in-
ternal combustion engine.  
A key challenge for electromobility is the question of how the 
energy is actually sourced. If the power is sourced from fossil 
fuels, then in life cycle terms electric vehicles too have a carbon 
footprint, to greater or lesser degree. The goal must therefore 
be to increase the amount of energy generated from renewable 
sources. The necessary policy framework for this can only be 
provided by government action. On its own initiative mean-
while, in the medium term Volkswagen is investing approxi-
mately €600 million in the expansion of renewables including 
solar, wind and hydroelectric power. The Company is directly 
Electromobility will have significant impacts on vehicle devel-
opment and production. For application in electric vehicles, al-
most every automotive component requires reassessment at the 
development stage. At the production stage too, new challenges 
need to be mastered – from overall factory design and new pro-
duction methods to training employees to work on high-voltage 
systems.
To address all these challenges, in 2011 Volkswagen gave the go-
ahead for the creation of an “E-Mobility Campus” at its Wolfs-
burg site, which will bring together all the Company’s expertise 
in the fields of electrical systems, electronic systems and electric 
drive. More than 1,700 people will work at this new centre of com-
petence.  Audi too will be opening an integrated electric-drive de-
velopment centre, which will employ more than 800 people.
Climate protection  
Climate protection is a key priority of sustainability manage-
ment at Volkswagen. A company that produces more than eight 
million vehicles a year has a special responsibility for the cli-
mate. The watchwords here are efficiency improvement and 
increased use of low-carbon fuels, based on a clear roadmap: 
the Volkswagen Powertrain and Fuel Strategy. 
As the contents of this report demonstrate, climate protection is 
the common denominator of a range of measures being carried 
out as part of Volkswagen’s commitment to greater sustainability. 
Such efforts are implemented at every stage in the automotive life 
cycle, starting at the production stage. Here Volkswagen is aim-
ing for a 25 percent reduction compared to 2010 in environmen-
tal impacts from production at all its plants by 2018, in five differ-
ent categories: energy consumption, waste, air-borne emissions, 
water consumption and, most importantly, CO2 emissions. All 
these efforts have their part to play in protecting the climate. 
Innovative efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from our products 
are coordinated at Group level by a Corporate CO2 Steering 
Group, whose aim is to develop efficient technologies for all 
brands and bring them to market as cost-effectively as possi-
ble, using modular toolkits. The CO2 registry is one such in-
strument, which analyses the CO2 emissions over the entire 
product� creation� process� for� every� vehicle� project� across� the�
Group. That way we can ensure that we meet the goal laid 
down in the Group’s Environmental Principles that every new 
model should represent an improvement in overall environ-
mental performance compared to its predecessor.

In addition to efficiently managing its own climate protection 
activities, Volkswagen is also actively engaged in many exter-
nal organisations and institutions dedicated to combating cli-
mate change. The aim is to establish a strong, evidence-based 
foundation for viable long-term concepts, both within the 
Company and in the wider political and social debate. In 2011, 
Volkswagen once again contributed actively to the climate pro-
tection efforts of the following national and international bod-
ies and scientific institutions:
Energy supply strategy
Volkswagen bears a responsibility for cutting emissions of green-
house gases – in particular by saving energy. At the same time, 
these energy savings must not come at the cost of reduced pro-
ductivity or continued growth. Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH en-
sures a stable balance between secure and at the same time eco-
friendly energy supplies by means of its energy supply strategy. 
The main goal of this strategy remains to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by 40 percent over 2010 levels by 2020. This goal re-
lates to Germany and thus concerns 45 percent of the Group’s 
worldwide CO2 emissions. To this end, Volkswagen will be invest-
ing around €600 million in the expansion of renewable energy 
resources including solar, wind and hydroelectric power. 
The Group continues to see great potential in the diversification 
of its power generation structure and undertook several meas-
ures to this end in the year under review. 
In Brazil Volkswagen invested around €120 million in 2011 in the 
expansion of hydroelectric power generation. One hydroelectric 
plant has been on stream since March 2010; the second will be 
completed in 2013. Together they will have an output of 48.2  
megawatts. This means they will be able to meet around 40 per-
cent of Volkswagen’s energy needs in Brazil. Volkswagen is the 
first automaker in Brazil to invest in the generation of clean re-
newable energy. In the course of construction, some 500 new 
jobs�were�created�in�the�region.�
  56
At the Company’s German sites too, power generation will in fu-
ture be a whole shade greener: Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH 
and the Austrian power utility Verbund Sales GmbH concluded 
a power supply contract to this end in 2011. According to the 
contract, from 2013 onwards Volkswagen will cover around 10 
percent of the power demand of the German Volkswagen Group 
facilities using power generated by the Austrian Group’s hydro-
electric plants. This will bring the proportion of the Group’s

All over the world, Volkswagen supports energy generation from renewable resources. In the medium term the 
Company will be investing approximately €600 million in this area. 
“Think Blue. Factory.” is the logical extension of the Volkswagen 
“Think Blue.” philosophy to our production plants. “Think Blue. Factory.” 
is a broadly focused cross-departmental initiative for all plants of the 
Volkswagen brand wordlwide. It covers the full range of ressource ef-
ficiency and emission reduction measures. The aim is to make more 
efficient use of energy, materials and water, and to reduce emissions 
of CO2 and pollutants. In all these areas, Volkswagen has set itself a 
target of reducing environmental impacts at every Volkswagen plant 
by 25 percent by 2018. The Think Blue. Factory. initiative is based on 
four pillars: 
Society
We are committed to meeting the expectations of our customers, in-
vestors and other stakeholders. To position ourselves as an industry 
leader, we use five environmental performance indicators to measure 
the environmental impact of our production processes: energy input 
(MWh), water consumption, waste output, CO2 emissions and solvent 
emissions. These five metrics make it easier to define realistic and bind-
ing improvement targets. 
Efficiency
Here the focus is on production processes in our factories. The results 
can be seen for example in the paintshop at the Chattanooga plant 
(USA), where the new dry paint separation process reduces water con-
sumption by around 75,000 litres of water per day compared with con-
ventional processes. For this and many other eco-friendly solutions, 
the plant was awarded LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmen-
tal Design) platinum certification. The Chemnitz plant in Germany 
provides a further example. By combining a range of different meas-
ures to improve resource efficiency, this Volkswagen engine plant was 
able to reduce specific energy consumption by 17 percent and drinking 
water consumption by 86 percent. These results helped earn the 
Chemnitz plant the “Factory of the Year 2011” award.
To encourage such efficiency improvements, the “Think Blue. Factory.” 
programme has developed an “eco-factory” vision of a model eco-
friendly production plant where all processes are geared to ecological 
efficiency. This vision will provide a template for future new factory 
construction. In addition, roadmaps are being drawn up to migrate all 
existing factories to more ecological status by 2018.   
Energy supply
Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH is developing ways of reducing CO2 
emissions at the energy generation and supply stage. The approach 
will focus on diversification of the energy generation structure to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions. Amongst other things Volkswagen 
is pressing ahead with the switch from coal to natural gas and is par-
ticipating in renewable energy generation projects. 
Employees
Under the umbrella of the “Think Blue. Factory.” logo, Volkswagen is 
committed to raising the awareness of all employees about responsible 
resource use and eco-friendly production. One example is the Wolfs-
burg plant’s “Energieweg” (energy path) initiative, which presents ex-
amples of successfully implemented energy efficiency projects, ranging 
from photovoltaic panels on factory roofs via energy-efficient heating 
pumps to the intranet-based virtual energy advisor. Such an initiative is 
a good way of motivating employees to develop their own ideas – and 
potentially be in line to win one of the Volkswagen Energy Cup awards, 
which are presented at the annual “Think Blue. Factory.” Day. 
Clean cars. Clean factory.
The “Think blue. Factory.” initiative
One initiative, four pillars: 
“Think Blue. Factory.” keeps employees  
informed and involved, smoothing the 
way to a comprehensively ecological 
factory.

Efficient production   
Volkswagen’s goal is to be market leader by 2018. Logically, 
therefore, production output will increase, driving up resource 
and energy consumption. However, since Volkswagen is also 
aiming to lead the environmental field by 2015, concrete action 
is required today to further improve production efficiency and 
thereby offset the effect of this future growth on resource and 
energy consumption. Under the “Think blue. Factory” pro-
gramme, Volkswagen is aiming to make its production 25 per-
cent more eco-friendly overall by 2018. That is to say, at all Volks-
wagen sites, energy consumption, waste, air-borne emissions 
and water consumption are to be reduced by one quarter. In 
2011, Volkswagen implemented numerous specific measures at 
its production plants to help it achieve this goal. 
Responsibility for energy-efficient production lies with the En-
ergy Management Production team. This team develops energy 
efficiency standards for the whole Group, which require for ex-
ample that plants must only purchase energy-efficient machine 
The Volkswagen Group is driving forward the expansion of energy generation 
from renewables.
Cooperation with Lichtblick
The LichtBlick/Volkswagen home power plant is a cogen-
eration plant producing combined heat and power (CHP). 
In the town of Celle in Lower Saxony, these distributed 
CHP mini-power plants are now for the first time being 
used to heat an entire residential quarter. A total of 13 
power plants are providing heating for 174 apartments in 
36 apartment buildings. 
The systems, which are installed in the cellars of these 
buildings, are Volkswagen EcoBlue natural gas-powered 
CHP plants with an efficiency of over 90 percent. The 13 
home power plants in Celle have a total rated output of 
0.24 megawatts. This flexibly generated distributed elec-
tric power is being fed into the grid to back up the inter-
mittent output of wind farms and solar power plants.
 To date, Lichtblick has installed approximately 400 CHP 
plants in Germany. Eventually, Volkswagen and Lichtblick 
plan to get 100,000 home power plants up and running 
nationwide. These systems will not only heat buildings 
but will also generate 2,000 megawatts of electric power 
 – equivalent to the output of two nuclear power stations.

Corporate Environment Working Group has been promoting 
worldwide best practice sharing. Workshops, Environment and 
Energy Days or the Volkswagen Energy Cup, launched for the 
first time last year, are some of the ways in which such practices 
are showcased. The 2011 Energy Cup award in the category “Low-
est Baseload” went to the Polkowice and Zwickau plants. In the 
category “Best Performance”, awards went to the Emden plant 
and the Production Unit 1 paintshop at the Wolfsburg plant.

The energy management systems at the SEAT production plants 
in Martorell and Barcelona (Zona Franca), along with the Tech-
nical Centre and Genuine Parts Centre, have now been certified 
to IS0 50.001 and UNE 16.001. SEAT is the first Spanish company 
to achieve ISO 50.001 certification, further strengthening the 
company’s position at the forefront of environmental protec-
tion efforts in Spain.
The virtual energy adviser, a Group-wide intranet application, 
offers employees information and tips on ways of saving energy 
and electricity. Model solutions, illustrated in a clear and easy-
to-understand way, are presented for typical consumers in the 
management, production, planning and controlling sectors of a 
virtual factory. Background information, standards and tools 
are also provided. 
In October, the Volkswagen brand opened a new production 
plant in Chengdu, China. This plant sets new standards of effi-
ciency and eco-friendliness. For example it sources 80 percent 
of its materials direct from the Chengdu region, reducing trans-
port distances and therefore emissions. New welding technolo-
gies consume only around 50 percent as much energy as con-
ventional technologies. The sheet aluminium used in forming 
processes is 100 percent recycled and reused. These and many 
other measures make the new Chengdu plant one of the green-
est, and most productive, factories in the whole of China. 
At the Audi plant in Neckarsulm, Germany, a whole series of rela-
tively small-scale measures implemented in 2011 added up to big 
energy�savings.�Some�5�GWh�of�power�is�being�saved�just�by�using�
new diode lasers in body production for the Audi A6. A further 
100,000 kWh is saved by using braking energy recuperation in 
the automatic storage/retrieval systems used in the new small 
parts store. The plant also uses waste heat from compressed air 
generation to heat one building, thereby cutting annual energy 
consumption by around 1.6 GWh. These and many other meas-
ures have cut energy consumption per vehicle produced from  
almost 3,400 kWh in 2003 to less than 2,900 kWh today. 
The Emden plant in Germany is also setting new standards of 
efficient production, not least through the wind energy and 
photovoltaic systems installed on the factory site and an energy 
wood plantation: on 400,000 square metres of previously un-
used space at the site an “energy wood” has been planted. Com-
prising fast-growing trees such as poplars and willows, the 
wood is to be harvested every three to five years. The resultant 
biomass will be used to generate eco-friendly heat energy. Per 
year and hectare the trees replace approximately 5,000 litres of 
light fuel oil. This equates to savings of up to 18 tons in emis-
sions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Also, new indoor 
air sensors are cutting ventilation energy costs by 75 percent.
Energy efficiency is built into new production plants right from 
the start. For example the LED exterior lighting system at the 
Chattanooga, Tennessee plant, which opened in 2011, uses ap-
proximately 68 percent less energy than conventional systems, 
saving 262,500 kWh of electricity a year. The plant also incorpo-
rates a range of heat insulation and heat recovery measures, all 
of which help to minimise energy consumption. For example, re-
flective white roof membranes reduce heat gain in the produc-
tion shops by up to 10°C. The production buildings are also insu-
lated with a 15-cm layer of mineral rock wool, resulting in annual 
energy savings of around 720,000 kWh. Thanks to these and 
many other features, the plant became the only car plant in the 
USA to earn platinum certification under the U.S. Green Building 
Council (USGBC)’s LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environ-
mental Design) certification system.  
  59
One thing is clear: the most energy-efficient solutions are those 
that don’t consume energy in the first place. But even when the 
production lines are not in use, production plants go on con-
suming energy – for example because certain areas have to be 
lit at all times, due to legal and safety requirements. To ensure 
that no energy is wasted, apart from what is needed for such 
“baseload” functions, the Corporate Energy Working Group 
has developed a system of so-called “master weekends”, when 
energy consumption is reduced to an absolute minimum by rig-
orously switching off all non-priority plant and equipment in 
accordance with a “switch-off” list of non-essential consumers. 
As well as reducing energy consumption, efficient processes 
and technologies also improve air quality. In line with Europe-
an air quality policy, such measures are a top priority for Volks-
wagen. For example filtration and separation systems are used 
to capture overspray from painting, or welding fumes produced 
during laser welding. 
  60
262,500   
kWh of power is what the Chattanooga plant  
saves each year thanks to modern LED-based  
outdoor lighting.

The Braunschweig plant is operating two separate biological 
waste air treatment systems to purify solvent-polluted waste air 
from painting processes. These include the use of microorgan-
isms, applied to a substrate material, to break down organic 
solvents. This method has the advantage of saving large quanti-
ties of natural gas which would otherwise be required if these 
pollutants were combusted in a thermal afterburner.
Air quality is also an important focus of in-house power genera-
tion at Volkswagen, for example at the Kassel plant in Germany, 
where modernisation of the power station including a switch to 
gas-fired operation resulted in significantly reduced emissions 
of particulates and nitrogen oxides in 2011, while at the same 
time improving efficiency. This Volkswagen power station also 
supplies district heat to the nearby town of Baunatal. There are 
also plans to generate green energy for consumption by the Kas-
sel plant using a rooftop solar panel system comprising 5,580 
photovoltaic modules.

percent less water required 
thanks to conversion to dry 
machining of aluminium 
components at the Salzgitter 
plant.
Environmental technology
On top of its measures to improve resource efficiency, Volks-
wagen has also adopted a wide range of technologies aimed at 
keeping unavoidable environmental impacts to an absolute 
minimum. Such environmental technology comprises waste/
wastewater reduction technology and waste air filtration  
systems. All Group brands are continuously working to improve 
these�systems,�as�the�following�examples�of�projects�from�2011�
demonstrate: 
The Salzgitter plant switched from “wet” to “dry” machining of 
aluminium components. The new method, which works with an 
oil/air mixture instead of an emulsion, reduces water consump-
tion by 90 percent, consumption of oleiferous media by 98 per-
cent and CO2 emissions by 54 percent.
Dry machining is also in use at the Polkowice plant in Poland. 
This plant has also introduced new air nozzles in compressed 
air generation, resulting in annual energy savings of 1,526 MWh 
and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1,300 tons. 
The afterburner used in waste air treatment at the Zwickau plant 
has been equipped with new turbulators. The resulting redirec-
tion of airflow in the heat exchanger pipe increases the heat 
transfer coefficient of the internal pipe wall, thereby reducing 
the energy consumption of the afterburner by 449 MWh a year. 
The new Chattanooga plant too set new standards in environ-
mental technology in 2011. A primerless painting process reduces 
CO2 emissions by around 20 percent. The Chattanooga paint-
shop is also the first in the world to use a dry separation process 
for top coat application. The resulting reduction in water and en-
ergy consumption also means reduced emissions. The plant also 
harvests rainwater and uses it for cooling and sanitation purpos-
es. With these and many other environmental technology meas-
ures, the Chattanooga plant was able to achieve the highest pos-
sible certification under the U.S. LEED standard (“Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design”).  
  59
Since 2008, Volkswagen has been using the “LEC” (Leakage 
and Energy Control) software to collect and monitor leak data 
for stationary refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. This 
method was first piloted at the Group’s German plants. Follow-
ing successful completion of this test phase, in 2011 the monitor-
ing system was also introduced at four sites in Spain. Now the 
plan is to roll the system out across Europe. Currently more 
than 12,000 systems are being monitored in a variety of refrig-
eration applications – such as compressed air dehumidifica-
tion, indoor air conditioning and machine cooling – and also in 
the canteen department. The average leakage rate for refrigera-
tion and air-conditioning systems has been reduced to 3.5 per-
cent. This compares with a figure of between 20 and 30 percent 
for the EU as a whole.
Volkswagen�is�keen�to�see�environmental�technology�projects�of�
this kind multiplied across the Group. An annual Energy and 
Environment Day has been introduced as an in-house forum for 
presenting�such�projects.�At�the�same�time�an�IT�tool�has�been�
put in place across the Group whereby improvement measures 
can be entered in a database, allowing additional financial, or-
ganisational and technological synergies and standardisation 
potential to be harnessed.
Green IT
Green IT is now an important lever for improving resource and 
energy efficiency, not least because of the large number of com-
puter workstations in the Company. Volkswagen is using this le-
ver, for example by expanding its IT-based networking, to make 
its global IT operations as cost- and resource-efficient as possi-
ble. It is particularly important to ensure that the relevant tech-
nology is easy to use in everyday practice and that it functions 
reliably. For this reason, in April Volkswagen launched a new 
computer centre on a 2,000 square-metre site at Group Head-
quarters in Wolfsburg. The centre sets new standards in terms 
of security, performance and energy efficiency.
In addition to an increased peak performance of up to 24.3 bil-
lion computing operations per second, and use of kinetic ener-
gy storage devices to maintain more stable functioning, the new 
computer centre also consumes less energy. Compared with the 
previous centre, annual power consumption has been reduced 
by 9.1 million kWh, savings equivalent to the power consump-
tion of more than 2,600 private households, based on an aver-
age annual household consumption of 3,500 kWh. In addition, 
the new computer centre features a high-efficiency indirect 
natural cooling system which for two thirds of the year uses out-
side air and therefore does not consume additional energy.
A further Green IT issue centres on efficient use of materials, 
both by the end users in the Company, who in-house media reg-
ularly urge to use hardware and consumables responsibly, and 
also by Central Procurement. An example from the year under 
review was Corporate IT’s iDOMP tender process for printers. 
Before the final decision was taken, the shortlisted printers 
were�subjected�to�a�Green�IT�assessment�covering�their�entire�
life cycle – from the materials used and type of packaging to 
reductions in in-use energy consumption and reduced elec-
tronic scrap at the end of the product life cycle.
Green logistics
Sustainable logistics is an important priority for the Volks- 
wagen Group. Our logistics processes are assessed on the basis 
of sustainability criteria and improved wherever this can bring 
economic and environmental benefits. We do this for in-plant 
processes, for inbound deliveries of materials and components, 
and for outbound shipments of finished vehicles. In a glo-
balised economy characterised by an ever-increasing flow of 
goods, this is an increasingly complex task. Volkswagen’s green 
logistics systems create environmental value by reducing re-
source and water consumption, emissions, fine particulate pol-
lution and waste. 
As the following examples show, the Volkswagen Group is ad-
dressing the challenges of sustainable logistics in a wide variety 
of ways.
For example SEAT transports components between its plants in 
Martorell and Barcelona’s freeport zone (Zona Franca), and 
new vehicles from its production lines to the Port of Barcelona, 
by rail. The company invested €8.6 million in these two links – 
which�are�now�taking�57,000�truck�journeys�off�the�roads�every�
year.  
In�a�pilot�project�with�the�Technical�University�of�Vienna,�Volks-
wagen’s Wolfsburg plant is now using natural gas-powered 
trucks�for�short-distance�road�transport.�This�pilot�project�has�
reduced CO2 emissions by 20 percent and nitrogen oxide emis-
sions by as much as 30 percent, while noise emissions have 
been halved. The pilot test is now being extended to further 
transport routes. 
In another example, the new Audi Logistics Centre at the Neck-
arsulm plant shows how the individual brands are improving 
sustainability on the intralogistics front too. Due to the multi-
tude of new models and the numerous different model versions, 
the number of small containers had almost doubled since 2008. 
Whereas the previous, less than ergonomic, system involved 
transporting the contents of these containers manually to their 
storage locations, the new “automated small container store” 
(AKL) can now process some 1,300 containers an hour. The new 
building is also equipped with intelligent environmental tech-
nology. For example waste heat from on-site utilities buildings 
is used to provide heating, while intelligent systems fitted in the 
automatic storage/retrieval systems, such as energy recupera-
tion and automatic drive shut-off, contribute further energy 
savings. In total, the new logistics centre in Neckarsulm can re-
duce emissions of CO2 by up to 500 tons a year. 
  49
For its resource-efficient and in part already CO2-free trans-
port concept, Audi was also awarded the Sustainability Prize 
for Logistics by the Federal Logistics Associations of Austria 
(BVL-A) and Germany (BVL-D).
Biodiversity   
Industrial growth inevitably has an impact on biological diver-
sity, which is the basis for healthy food, clean water and a bal-
anced�climate.�Volkswagen�identified�this�conflict�of�objectives�
at an early stage. Which is why the challenges of species protec-
tion and nature conservation are not merely a temporary pro-
ject�for�Volkswagen,�but�have�long�been�an�established�element�
of its environmental management . 
  40
Conservation of biodiversity is therefore discussed at the regu-
lar Regional Conferences, and the necessary measures are laid 
down in the resulting action plans. In addition, 2011 again saw 
Volkswagen taking part in the international initiative “Biodiver-
sity in Good Company”.  
  61
Activities designed to increase biodiversity require a basis of ac-
curate information about land take, the environmental impacts 
of individual manufacturing locations and the protectable spe-
cies within their sphere of influence. Since 2010, Volkswagen has 
teamed up with external partners in the scientific and insurance 
worlds to prepare a risk analysis that identifies the emission 
risks arising from the Company’s operations, such as exhaust air, 
wastewater, waste, noise or vibration, sets them against the po-
tential adverse effects on water, soil and biodiversity in the local 
environment, and evaluates them. This analysis has not only re-
sulted in much better information about the ecological integra-
tion of the factories in their individual landscape settings, but 
has also made for improvements in efficiency and savings in 
costs. In 2010, the first step was to appraise the Volkswagen and 
Audi factories in Emden, Wolfsburg, Braunschweig, Hanover, 
Kassel, Chemnitz, Zwickau, Dresden, Ingolstadt and Neckar-

sulm. This was followed in 2011 by the European factories in Po-
land, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Spain and Bel-
gium.� These� will� be� joined� in� 2012� by� more� Volkswagen� AG�
locations and also Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini facilities 
in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Moreover, 
Volkswagen do Brasil has launched the “Fauna Monitoring and 
Preservation Program” to protect domestic species in that 
country. 
The Volkswagen Group is implementing specific measures to 
increase biodiversity. One of the biggest nature conservation 
projects�is�the�reforestation�of�the�“Izta-Popo”�mountain�region�
in� Mexico.� Plans� are� under� way� to� launch� a� similar� project� in�
the Sierra de Lobos Silao National Park, which is close to the 
site of a planned new engine factory.  
  62
In Mexico we are contributing to the programme “Por amor al 
planeta” (“For love of the planet”) which supports scientific re-
search into biodiversity in Mexico and its conservation. This 
support is made up of two categories: a sponsorship prize, the 
“Conservation Biology Research Award”, and a research grant. 
In 2011 the award went to scientist Maria Enriqueta Velarde 
González, from the Marine Biology Institute of the University of 
Veracruz. She is investigating species diversity among seabirds, 
especially the gulls and terns found on Isla Rasa, an island in 
 the Gulf of California. 
In Germany Volkswagen is initiating and pursuing numerous 
projects�relating�to�the�ecological�upgrading�and�interlinking�of�
forests and waters – for example the River Aller close to the 
main factory in Wolfsburg. In 2011 a programme entitled “Volks-
wagen�connects�habitats”�identified�most�effective�projects�and�
most promising river sections for biotope networking along the 
Aller�and�launched�the�projects.�This�achieved�concrete�results:�
a 400-metre stretch of the stream known as Weesener Bach, 
which had previously been sanded up, now has a natural grav-
el bed again, providing a spawning ground for sensitive fish 
species�such�as�river�trout.�In�conjunction�with�the�Nature�and�
Biodiversity Conservation Union (Naturschutzbund Deutsch-
land�–�NABU),�Volkswagen�is�also�supporting�the�project�“Re-
naturing the Lower Havel”. In 2011 the employees at the Wolfs-
burg facility were called upon to bring in any unwanted mobile 
phones and place them in collecting boxes. From the proceeds 
of this recycling campaign, €3 per phone were donated to  
Europe’s biggest river renaturing programme. In view of its 
great success, the campaign is to be repeated in 2012. 
  63
In collaboration with the Otter Protection Campaign, plans 
were� also� made� for� an� overall� project� lasting� several� years� as�
part of the “Federal Programme for Biological Diversity”.
Volkswagen�is�also�supporting�the�Wild�Cat�Project�run�by�the�
environmental protection and nature conservation association 
Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND) and is 
taking� part� with� NABU� in� the� project� “Welcome� Wolf”.� This�
public relations campaign provides the public with factual in-
formation about the wolf, which is once again becoming estab-
lished in the wild in Germany. 
Another key area for Volkswagen is the renaturing of moor-
lands. Following the renaturing of the 240-hectare Theiken-
meer lake in northwest Germany, a start was made in 2011 on 
rehydration of the “Grosses Moor” nature conservation area 
near�Gifhorn,�also�in�the�north�of�Germany.�This�project�pro-
vides protection for a unique habitat for some 150 endangered 
animal species and 40 vascular plant species. For this and oth-
er� moorland� protection� projects,� Volkswagen� Leasing� GmbH�
got together with NABU in 2011 to found the German Moorland 
Protection Fund. This is sponsored by Volkswagen Leasing to 
the tune of €1.6 million.

This moorland protection forms an integral part of the environ-
mental programme that Volkswagen Leasing has developed 
jointly�with�NABU.�It�works�like�this:�if�a�fleet�operator�selects�a�
CO2-optimised model from the Volkswagen Group, Volkswagen 
Leasing GmbH pays a defined contribution to the Moorland 
Protection Fund. One outcome has been that over the last three 
years, average CO2 emissions by all new additions to Volks- 
wagen Leasing fleets have fallen by 11 percent. The successful 
cooperation between Volkswagen Leasing GmbH and NABU 
was renewed for another five years in 2011. On a new website, 
Volks-wagen provides information about its long-standing stra-
tegic�partnership�with�NABU�and�presents�details�of�their�joint�
activities. Not only employees and customers, but also politi-
cians and the media are encouraged to engage in a critical dia-
logue and to help shape this cooperation through ideas and 
suggestions of their own. 
1.6     
million euros is the amount 
with which Volkswagen Leas-
ing is supporting the German 
Moorland Protection Fund.
Water
Water is not only the source of all life but an economic factor as 
well. Water is indispensable at every stage of the vehicle life  
cycle. We are committed to using this valuable resource as pru-
dently as possible. Our aim is to reduce water consumption at 
Volkswagen by 25 percent by 2018 over 2010 levels. Amongst 
other things, this goal takes into account the problem of signifi-
cant regional variations in water availability.
The water footprint is an important aspect of efficient resource 
management. We have calculated water footprints for selected 
models based on the extensive data collected for our Life Cycle 
Assessments. The water footprint allows us to identify those pro-
cesses with the highest life cycle water consumption. The assess-
ment not only takes into account direct water consumption at our 
production plants but also quantifies and assesses processes in 
the other life cycle phases. Our water footprint assessments 
show, for example, that the life cycle water consumption of the 
volume-selling Polo, Golf and Passat Estate models is approxi-
mately 52 m³, 62 m³ and 83 m³ respectively. Detailed analysis 
shows that for water consumption – unlike CO2 emissions – the 
impact of the vehicle's service life is minimal. 96 percent of water 
consumption occurs at the manufacturing phase. However, only 
a small fraction of this is used during production directly on site 
at our plants. Most water is consumed by upstream material pro-
duction and supply processes. It is therefore hardly surprising 
that an analysis of the total life cycle water consumption of Volks-
wagen vehicles shows that in terms of regional distribution, wa-
ter is consumed in more than 40 countries worldwide. In 2011, 
water consumption over which Volkswagen had direct influence 
was on average 5.07 m³ per vehicle. The water consumption at 
the�Puebla�plant�in�Mexico�of�just�3.57�m³�per�vehicle�shows�how�
a large number of small measures can ultimately have big effect 
in terms of reducing water consumption. The first measures 
comprised optimisation of existing production processes, and 
internal water recycling. This brought savings of 1.0 m³ per vehi-
cle. Rainwater harvesting reduced water consumption per vehi-
cle by a further 0.5 m³. Finally, employee awareness training, 
and installation of water-saving sanitary fittings resulted in a fur-
ther saving of 0.23 m³ per vehicle. 
In all areas of its operations, Volkswagen aims to recycle water 
as intensively as possible at the point of use. The Salzgitter 
plant, for example, has taken a variety of plant-specific meas-
ures which now ensure that all freshwater is recycled an aver-
age of 50 times before it leaves the plant. 
But�responsible�water�use�is�not�just�about�reducing�water�con-
sumption but also about proactive resource protection and man-
agement. The Sustainability Report 2010 already reported on the 
Izta-Popo� project� at� Volkswagen� Mexico� to� reduce� soil� erosion�
and improve rainwater retention at the Puebla site. Planting of 
further conifers, initiated by local suppliers, has increased rain-
water infiltration by approximately 900,000 m³ annually. In a 
further (fourth) stage, 500 hectares are being planted with a fur-
ther 20,000 conifers, and 10,000 soakaways are being construct-
ed. This measure will increase rainwater infiltration by a further 
120,000 m³ annually. In total, the approximately 420,000 coni-
fers and 47,000 soakaways will increase rainwater infiltration by 
2.62 million m³. This will feed into the underground aquifer, 
thereby increasing local water supplies.
A� similar� project� will� now� be� rolled� out� at� the� Silao� engine�
plant. Increased production at this plant from 2012 will in-
crease water consumption by 89,000 m³. To offset this, the 
plant is proposing to reforest an area of 114 hectares, which will 
result in additional infiltration of  100,000 m³ of water into the 
groundwater annually. The Puebla state water utility SOAPAP in 
Puebla is so impressed with Volkswagen’s water management 
projects�that�it�has�asked�the�company�for�help�in�coordinating�
a� groundwater� replenishment� project� in� the� Iztaccihuatl-Pop-
ocatepetl National Park. 
In the Sustainability Report 2007/2008, Volkswagen reported 
for�the�first�time�on�a�joint�project�with�the�misereor�charity,�in�
an arid area of north-eastern Brazil, to support the installation 
of�manually�operated�groundwater�pumps.�The�project�is�giving�
local people the opportunity to earn a secure living from arable 
and livestock farming. The Volkswagen do Brasil Foundation 
first�became�involved�in�the�pump�project�in�2004�at�the�initia-
tive of the Works Council. With the collaboration of Brazilian 
NGOs�Autovisão�Brasil�and�Menegotti,�this�project�continues�to�
make good progress and has been integrated into the Ministry 
of Social Development’s “Programa Segunda Agua” water pro-
gramme. By mid-2011 698 pumps had been installed, supplying 
water for 105,500 people, in more than 20,000 households.
The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga in the U.S. state of Ten-
nessee, which opened in 2011, is setting new standards in its ap-
proach to water management. Rainwater is collected in three 
tanks and used for example to flush toilets. The roof surfaces 
which drain into these tanks can each supply up to 2,470 m³ of 
rainwater a year. The state-of-the-art paintshop at this plant 
uses a dry overspray separation system which uses crushed 
stone to capture paint particles, and saves around 190 m³ of wa-
ter every day. Outside the plant, rainwater evaporates in a semi-
natural trough system. This provides natural outdoor cooling 
and reduces rainwater runoff from sealed surfaces. At the same 
time the network of 30-metre-wide creeks and wetlands pro-
vides new natural habitats.

ures it is taking to reduce the risk of water shortages. Informa-
tion about experiences and lessons learned is made available to

Resource efficiency 
A company planning to sell more than ten million vehicles a 
year by 2018 has a special obligation to make responsible use of 
resources. For the Volkswagen Group, resource efficiency is im-
portant not only as a crucial key to improved cost efficiency but 
also as a way of demonstrating environmental responsibility. 
Improved resource efficiency can provide an answer to growing 
ecological and economic challenges and offers a way of offset-
ting changes in commodity prices resulting from geopolitical 
factors. Resource efficiency is already firmly integrated into our 
business practices, and in future is set to play an even greater 
role in the day-to-day workings of our Company.
Substance flow management is a helpful tool for ensuring great-
er resource efficiency during the manufacturing process. Sub-
stance flow management facilitates transparent matching of en-
ergy and substance flows to specific processes, and provides a 
basis for comparing different scenarios or technologies and 
identifying improvement opportunities. In 2011, Volkswagen 
therefore began developing a substance flow management sys-
tem which is now being used, amongst other things, in the plan-
ning of new paintshop facilities and to assess existing ones. In the 
course of 2012, Volkswagen will be reviewing the potential for ex-
panding the use of this tool to the Group as a whole, and will be 
looking at ways of further improving its user-friendliness.
Intensive, Group-wide, systematic optimisation of resource ef-
ficiency is also the focus of a corporate working group set up by 
Volkswagen� in� 2011.� The� objective� is� to� take� an� integrated� ap-
proach to topics such as recycling, environmental research and 
purchasing across all Group brands. 
Volkswagen sees active employee engagement as central to en-
suring that responsible resource use is established as standard 
practice in every area of the organisation. The Volkswagen 
brand, for example, has adopted the “Think Blue.Factory.” pro-
gramme aimed at developing employee awareness of this issue 
through extensive internal reporting. This is one of the ways in 
which Volkswagen is planning to cut environmental impacts 
from all its plants by 25 percent by 2018. 
The Volkswagen Group expects new political initiatives at Ger-
man and international level to provide further support in the 
drive towards greater resource efficiency. In its roadmap for 
2020, published in 2011, the EU Commission defined a policy 
framework for a resource-efficient Europe which would set Eu-
rope on track to become the world’s most resource-efficient re-
gion. One important step towards this goal will be to develop 
indicators for measuring resource efficiency. In Germany, the 
Ministry for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety is 
preparing to publish the national resource efficiency pro-
gramme “ProgRess”. ProgRess will focus primarily on support 
for�research�projects,�on�improved�communication�and�on�sup-
port for SMEs.
Volkswagen works within industry associations to promote effi-
cient, sustainable resource use not only at Company level but 
also at industry level. For example, Volkswagen is participating 
in the Working Group on Energy and Resource Efficiency of the 
6th Government Commission of the Lower Saxony Ministry of 
the Environment and the Federation of German Industry 
(BDI)’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Resource Efficiency Pro-
grammes.�Volkswagen�is�also�actively�involved�in�research�proj-
ects and research groups on resource efficiency such as the 
“Resource Efficiency in Production” programme (Effizienzfa-
brik) and “Green Carbody Technologies”.

Vehicle recycling 
End-of-life recycling capability is built into our new vehicles at 
the development stage. Volkswagen has developed and intro-
duced numerous processes which ensure that its new vehicles 
are now at least 85 percent recyclable and 95 percent “recover-
able”. Compliance with these figures is regularly checked by 
the German Federal Motor Vehicles Office. And thanks to the 
Volkswagen SiCon process, which is also capable of recycling 
shredder residues, the 95 percent recovery target for end-of-
life vehicles can be met in a way that is not only environmentally 
compatible but also economically viable.  
  71
Normally, in the EU, end-of-life Volkswagen vehicles are taken 
back free of charge. These vehicles are then recycled by an ex-
tensive network of SME recycling partners. Our genuine re-
420,000     
conifers are being planted by Volkswagen México as 
part�of�the�Izta-Popo�reforestation�project.�
manufactured parts range for the Volkswagen, Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, Audi, Seat and Škoda brands comprises 
more than 16,000 parts from around 60 product groups. Every 
year the Kassel plant remanufactures 48,000 engines (in 490 
versions), 60,000 cylinder heads (in 220 versions) and 49,000 
transmissions (in 550 versions). These parts meet the same 
quality requirements and carry the same warranties as new 
parts. Born out of necessity sixty years ago in the immediate af-
termath of the war, remanufacturing has gone on to become a 
win-win model, combining both ecological and economic ben-
efits.�Major�powertrain�components�are�reconditioned�at�a�car-
bon-neutral remanufacturing facility in Kassel. Last year, the 
Würzburg used parts store took back 3.35 million used compo-
nents, one third of them from Germany and two thirds from Eu-
rope and the rest of the world. These components included not 
only engines, transmissions and cylinder heads but also all 
components listed in the take-back criteria. 
  72
In 2011, Volkswagen also began remanufacturing selected com-
ponents in markets outside Germany. In August, a new power-
train remanufacturing facility was opened in China. This facili-
ty can remanufacture 15,000 engines a year to “as-new” quality.

The chart shows the diversity of the commodities and materials that  
go into a car.
The remanufactured engine comes with the same warranty as a 
new one. And since remanufacturing allows something like 70 
percent of the engine’s original materials to be conserved and 
reused, this new facility will save large quantities of valuable re-
sources, particularly steel. There are therefore already plans to 
extend the range of engines remanufactured at this site in Dali-
an, eastern China.  
  73
One of Volkswagen’s environmental goals is to reduce its con-
sumption of primary raw materials. This is why use of quality-
assured recycled materials is an explicit requirement in Volks-
wagen’s general environmental specifications, which apply to 
all�projects.�In�the�current�Golf,�Polo�and�Sharan�models,�recy-
cled materials make up around 40 percent of the vehicle by 
weight.  
  74, 
  76
A further environmental goal calls for increased use of renewa-
ble raw materials. At present, renewable materials make up ap-
proximately 1 percent of the total weight of the entry-level Golf 
model, for example. More relevantly, substitution of VDA Group 
5 materials (polymers) stands at around 4 percent. For the Golf 
Plus, with door trim panels made from renewable materials, 
substitution of VDA Group 5 materials stands at over 6 percent.
Recycling of batteries from electric vehicles is already a focus in 
Volkswagen’s current vehicle development work. In order to 
conserve lithium reserves, Volkswagen is aiming to achieve 
complete resource recycling for these batteries. Recycling of all 
components of the battery will have both ecological and eco-
nomic benefits. 2011 saw the successful conclusion of the 
LithoRec�research�project,�in�which�Volkswagen�and�15�partner�
companies for the first time developed and tested efficient pro-
cesses and concepts for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries. 
These processes cover the entire end-of-life process chain – 
from dismantling, transport, collection and storage to recycling 
and� production� of� new� battery� cells.� With� this� project,� Volks-
wagen has demonstrated the practical feasibility of achieving  
a high recycling rate for lithium, cobalt and nickel.

Awards
Products of the Volkswagen Group regularly win prizes and top 
placings in competitions and ranking lists organised by inter-
national organisations and companies, institutes, associations, 
magazines and periodicals. The placings are not only proof of 
the Company’s successes in the development of efficient power-
train technologies but also provide valuable feedback on the 
everyday benefits of these technologies. Volkswagen won nu-
merous such awards in 2011: 
>  The natural gas-powered Passat TSI EcoFuel scooped a hat 
trick of awards in the Challenge Bibendum 2011, a sustaina-
ble vehicle rally and test event organised by erdgas mobil 
GmbH and tyre manufacturer Michelin. Based on pioneering 
engine� technology� with� twin� charging� and� direct� injection,�
the Passat TSI EcoFuel returned fuel consumption on the test 
track�of�just�2.8�kilograms�of�natural�gas�per�100�kilometres,�
equivalent to CO2�emissions�of�just�77�g/km.�This�earned�the�
Passat TSI EcoFuel awards in the categories “Fuel Efficiency”, 
“Well-to-Wheel CO2 Emissions” and “Local Emissions”. 
>  The Touran 1.4 TSI EcoFuel received the German motoring 
organisation ADAC’s 2011 “Yellow Angel” award in the “Fu-
ture” category, based on its very low CO2�emissions�of�just�125�
g/km (with 7-speed DSG transmission). 
>  Germany’s Automobil-Club Verkehr (ACV) presented the 
Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion with its ACVMobil award. With 
average fuel consumption of 3.3 litres/100 km and CO2 emis-
sions� of� just� 87� g/km,� this� model� was� voted� most� ecological�
and economical vehicle by ACV members. 
>  The Volkswagen brand has been voted “most eco-friendly car 
brand” by German car magazine “Firmenauto” for the sec-
ond time in a row. Of more than 2,300 readers who took part 
in the online poll, over half voted for Volkswagen, based on its 
extensive range of low-CO2 models.  
>  The Fachverband für Sponsoring e.V. presented Volkswagen 
with the Sponsoring Award for its cooperation with the Ger-
man Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU). 
The cooperation was hailed as a successful example of credi-
ble and sustainable cooperation in the environmental field. 
>  The Touareg Hybrid received motoring magazine Offroad’s 
2011 OFF ROAD Eco award for pioneering, eco-friendly, sus-
tainable technologies.
>  More than 11,000 readers of AUTO TEST magazine voted the 
Golf Blue-e-Motion “e-Car of the year” in the category “con-
cept car”.
>  In the “Environmental Car List 2011/2012”, the German Asso-
ciation for Transport and the Environment (VCD)’s annual 
listing of cars offering the best overall environmental perfor-
mance, the Touran 1.4 TSI EcoFuel came first in the 7-seater 
category on the criteria “fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 
per vehicle-kilometre”, “noise” and “level and type of pollut-
ant emissions”, and so took the top slot in this category. A total 
of nine Volkswagen Group products were among the best ve-
hicles in their respective classes in the new ranking. 
>  A new system for manufacturing carbon fibre reinforced plas-
tic (CFRP), the aRTM system, developed and patented by  
Volkswagen in cooperation with suppliers, won an ÖkoGlobe 
award from the University of Duisburg-Essen’s “ÖkoGlobe” 
Institute. The innovative material will go into limited produc-
tion in the XL1 scheduled for 2013. 
> Meanwhile, Audi won second place in the “Green Steering 
Wheel�2011”�award�with�its�project�on�“e-gas”�–�as�used�for�ex-
ample in the A3 TCNG.
>��In�November�2011,�the�trade�journal�“Automobil�Produktion”�
and the consulting firm Agamus Consult presented Volkswa-
gen Slovakia with the Automotive Lean Production Award for 
efficient production in the OEM category at its Bratislava 
plant.
>  In December 2011, the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Ten-
nessee, earned platinum certification under the LEED® 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certifica-
tion programme. The certificate, which is awarded by the 
U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in four grades, con-
firms compliance with rigorous standards of sustainable and 
eco-friendly construction. Volkswagen’s Chattanooga facility 
is the first and so far the only automotive manufacturing 
plant to achieve platinum certification.
> With a raft of measures to improve resource efficiency, the 
Volkswagen brand’s Chemnitz engine plant was able to re-
duce specific energy consumption by 17 percent and drinking 
water consumption by 86 percent. This earned the Chemnitz 
plant the “Factory of the Year” award from the trade maga-
zine “Produktion”. 
  78
>  For its resource-efficient and in part already CO2-free trans-
port concept, Audi was also awarded the Sustainability Prize 
for Logistics by the Federal Logistics Associations of Austria 
(BVL-A) and Germany (BVL-D).
Award-winning, eco-friendly and sustainable production

Social indicators
Volkswagen’s workforce is constantly growing. On December 31, 
2011, the Volkswagen Group had a total of 501,956 employees on 
the worldwide payroll. That is 25.7% more than at the end of the 
2010 financial year (399,381 employees).
One�major�factor�in�this�increase�was�the�consolidation�of�Por-
sche Holding Salzburg with 20,652 employees and of MAN SE 
with 53,722 employees. The workforce also rose due to growth in 
volume, from which our German sites also benefited.

One of the Company’s goals is to continue to increase the proportion of 
women from 14.7% across the Group, especially in management. In the year 
under review, the proportion of women in management roles in the Volks-
wagen Group in Germany was already increased to 4.9% among senior 
executives, to 6.4% in senior management and to 10.1% in management 
(situation at year end, excl. Scania, excl. MAN).

In order to be able to respond properly to the increased numbers of school  
leavers in 2011 as a result of Germany’s school reforms, the Volkswagen Group 
made additional training places available in Germany.
The annual employee opinion survey, introduced in 2008, is an established 
standardised Group-wide tool designed to assess employee satisfaction, 
eliminate errors and improve work processes. Its acceptance and level of 
participation are growing year by year.

Since 2007, the average age at Volkswagen AG has been relatively 
constant, which is a sign of a healthy balance between recruitment 
of employees on completion of their training and retirement of 
long-serving employees.
The chart shows the age structure of 
the employees in the Volkswagen 
Group in Germany. The recruitment 
of qualified younger employees as a 
result of hiring industrial and com-
mercial trainees as well as students 
on “dual system” courses is reflected 
in the 18-27 age groups. The average 
age of employees working in Ger-
many is 40.8 years, while the aver-
age age of the Volkswagen AG work-
force is 42.3 years.

Low absenteeism calls for increased availability of diagnostic and preventive 
measures. Absenteeism is calculated using the formula: number of days  
lost to illness or accident multiplied by 100, divided by total possible days’ 
attendance in the relevant period.

The accident frequency index is an indication of the frequency with which 
accidents at work occurred in relation to the total number of hours worked. 
The formula for calculating the index is: number of occupational accidents, 
multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of hours worked.
The accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents are by relating 
the total number of working days lost to the number of hours worked. In this 
case, the formula for calculating the index is: number of working days lost, mul-
tiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of hours worked multiplied by ten.
As is clear from the accident frequency index, the number of accidents is falling 
continuously. This is mainly attributable to a more systematic approach to and 
continuous improvement in occupational safety at the Group’s plants. Accident 
severity in the Volkswagen Group has also declined since 2006. After the period 
from 2006 to 2010 during which there were no fatal accidents in Volkswagen 
AG, 2011 saw the death of one Volkswagen AG employee as the result of an  
occupational accident. The greatest improvements in occupational safety were 
achieved at Volkswagen Poznan, Volkswagen do Brasil in São Carlos, Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles in Hanover and at Volkswagen Motor Polska in Polkowice.

Year by year, Volkswagen continues to enhance occupational safety across the 
Group. The rise in the number of occupational accidents between 2007 and 
2008 is due to statistical factors, because from 2008 onwards the figures also 
include occupational accidents affecting salaried staff. This change in reporting 
to include the entire workforce was introduced to comply with worldwide re-
porting standards.

Environmental indicators
As in previous Volkswagen Sustainability Reports, selected Volk-
swagen Group environmental data are again presented in aggre-
gated form. The environmental data are collected, checked and 
approved at the individual production plants in line with an in-
ternal standard (VW standard 98 000) and a process standard. As 
a result of improvements in data collection procedures at indi-
vidual�sites,�slight�adjustments�may�have�been�made�to�the�previ-
ous year’s values. 
In addition to stating absolute environmental performance, this 
report again also shows relative indicators. These are obtained 
by relating the absolute environmental performance to the num-
ber of vehicles produced in the Group. The “number of vehicles 
produced” reference variable does not include the volume of  
vehicles produced by MAN SE. 
The environmental data in the Sustainability Report provide a com-
pact reflection of trends in the Group’s overall environmental per-
formance. In total, environmental data were collected from 67 pro-
duction plants with a workforce of around 370,000 (as at Dec. 31, 
2011). The following Group production plants are not yet included: 
> Chengdu plant, FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd.
> MAN SE production sites
As in the past, the non-manufacturing companies (e.g. Financial 
Services) are not included in the environmental data. In many 
cases, these are either not governed by the management of the 
respective production plants or are non-manufacturing compa-
nies and therefore fall outside the reporting framework de-
scribed in VW standard 98 000.
Due to changes arising from the affiliation of Volkswagenkraft-
werk GmbH power plants to the Volkswagen car brand on Jan-
uary 1, 2010, the values from VW Kraftwerk GmbH were incorpo-
rated into the environmental figures accordingly. As a result, the 
data�for�2010�were�also�adjusted.�
The graphs of carbon dioxide emissions do not include emissions 
arising from the supply of district heat to the municipal utilities 
LandE-Stadtwerke Wolfsburg and Stadtwerke Baunatal. The to-
tal carbon dioxide volumes involved here are 348,075 tons for 
2010 and 291,901 tons for 2011.

The increase in energy and fuel gas consumption is associated with the continuous increase in production over the reporting period. Heat consumption, being the 
sum of space heat and industrial heat, is subject to variation due to climatic and manufacturing conditions. In relation to the number of vehicles produced, con-
sumption of fuel gases, heat and electricity, one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions, was down thanks to the Group’s resource conservation strategy.

Due to the above-mentioned changes to the assignment of power plants, total CO2 emissions have been re-evaluated from 2010 onwards. This led to an in-
crease in total CO2 emissions, since, in addition to heating demand, these figures also take account of electrical energy consumption. However, against a back-
ground of a marked increase in vehicle output from the Volkswagen Group, total CO2 emissions per vehicle have fallen over the entire reporting period.

A downward trend in emissions can be seen for the period 2007 to 2009. This trend continues at a higher level following the consolidation of Volkswagen 
Kraftwerk GmbH. The specific values per vehicle also follow the same trend despite the increase in production output. Compared to the figures in the previous 
report, there were also changes in the prior-year data for NOx emissions owing to modifications in the presentation of the reported data.

dioxide emissions do not include those emissions arising from the supply of district heat to the municipal utilities LandE-Stadtwerke Wolfsburg and Stadt-
werke Baunatal. The total carbon dioxide volumes involved here are 348,075 tonns for 2010 and 291,901 tonns for 2011. The affiliation of power plants into the 
Volkswagen car brand led to an increase in direct CO2 emissions at the production plants in question. Increased production volumes in the Volkswagen Group 
also led to a rise in direct CO2 emissions. Despite the above-stated changes, increased production volumes and the inclusion of new production plants, with an 
associated increase in energy consumption, direct CO2 emissions were down from 2010 to 2011. Resource-optimised manufacturing processes and methods 
have had a positive impact on CO2 emissions per vehicle produced.

Due to the inclusion of additional production plants and the volumes consumed by Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH, water consumption and wastewater 
volumes rose over the reporting period. Increased production across the Group also contributed to this increase. At many plants, water consumption has 
basically dropped relative to the volume of vehicles produced thanks to the Volkswagen Group’s resource conservation strategy.

As a result of the increase in production across the Group, there was an increase in chemical oxygen demand in wastewater contamination. 
However, per vehicle produced, this parameter has declined.
As a result of the increase in vehicle production over the reporting period and the associated higher paint consumption, there was an increase in VOC 
emissions. Modified calculation methods also contributed to the increase.

As a result of increased production across the Group and the introduction of new models, metallic waste volumes rose over the total reporting period.  
The reduction in this kind of waste per vehicle is attributable to improved material utilisation and resource-optimised manufacturing processes. Over the  
entire reporting period, there has been a relative improvement in almost all types of waste.

Capital expenditure on environmental protection has risen over the entire reporting period. Water conservation and air pollution control accounted for the 
largest proportion of capital expenditure over the last year. Operating costs for environmental protection have remained virtually unchanged. Water conser-
vation accounted for the largest proportion of operating costs, while air pollution control was also a major factor in operating costs in the year under review.

Goals and actions
The Sustainability Programme set out below summarises the 
most important newly defined goals. The complete list of all 
new goals and actions and a progress report on the goals and 
actions contained in the Sustainability Programme from our 
Sustainability Report 2010 can be found on the internet:

By 2018, Volkswagen is aiming to become the most profitable, 
fascinating and sustainable automobile company in the world. 
In pursuit of this goal, through the use of intelligent innova-
tions and technologies Volkswagen aims to become the world 
leader in customer satisfaction and quality. Plans envisage unit 
sales rising to over 10 million vehicles a year in the long term as 
Volkswagen�targets�a�larger�share�of�the�major�growth�markets.�
The pretax return on sales is scheduled to increase to an 8 per-
cent minimum in the long term to ensure a robust and flexible 
financial position in market downturns. And in addition, Volks-
wagen aims to become the first-choice employer in all brands, 
companies and regions as the prerequisite for building a top 
team.

Workforce donation
Workforce donation has a long tradition at Volkswagen as a 
means� through� which� employees� join� forces� to� help� those� in�
need: in 2011, employees of Volkswagen AG alone gave more 
than €1.7 million to good causes. 
Employee�giving�represents�a�major�contribution�by�the�Com-
pany and its employees to those in need in locations where  
Volkswagen AG operates. In 2011, some €518,000 went into sup-
porting�regional�social�projects,�including�the�“Starthilfe”�(Get-
ting�Started)�project�devoted�to�combating�the�growing�problem�
of child poverty in the Wolfsburg region. “Starthilfe” uses dona-
tions�to�launch,�promote�and�focus�projects�and�measures�to�al-
leviate child poverty.
In the “One hour for the future” campaign, meanwhile, Volks-
wagen and Audi employees donate an hour’s pay to help street 
children, and in 2011, Volkswagen AG employees alone raised 
over�€580,000�for�aid�projects�in�Mexico,�Brazil,�Argentina�and�
South Africa as well as in Germany. Since the summer of 2003, 
this initiative has also included the collection of “spare cents”: 
employees donate the odd cents included on their monthly  
pay slip. 
When a natural disaster hits, the Company and the Works  
Council launch a special appeal. In 2011, for example, Volks- 
wagen Group employees working in Germany contributed  
over €1 million to the Japanese Red Cross in response to  
an appeal after the devastating tsunami in Japan.
Global Compact
The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to align-
ing their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, la-
bour, environment and anti-corruption. Volkswagen AG has been supporting this initiative since 2002. The 
cross-references can be found on page 98. 
Sustainability Code
The German Council for Sustainable Development unanimously approved the German Sustaina-
bility Code at its plenary session on October 13, 2011. The German Sustainability Code makes sus-
tainability efforts of companies visible and more bindingly relevant and comparable. It thereby 
provides a broader basis for the realisation of sustainability. 
Among other things, the Sustainability Code includes recommendations for sustainable corporate behaviour in the fields  
of strategy, process management, the environment and society, as well as guidance on how best to implement the Code.

Volkswagen workforce to include more women
In spring 2011, the Volkswagen Group unveils a voluntary in-
itiative setting out differentiated targets aimed at achieving 
a long-term increase in the proportion of women in the 
workforce at its German sites. The targets set out a detailed 
timetable for achieving specific percentages of women at all 
relevant hierarchical levels.

claiming “Climate destruc-
tion made in Germany”. The protest is accompanied by the 
internet campaign “vwdarkside.com”.

Highlights and lowlights
November 2011
Award for exemplary engagement for people  
with disabilities
Škoda receives an award as part of the “best full responsi-
bility enterprises” award, for its exemplary employment 
policy for people with disabilities. Earlier in the year, in 
June 2011, this policy also earned the Company the “Employ-
ers without Barriers” award.
December 2011
LEEd platinum certification
The Volkswagen plant in Chat-
tanooga, Tennessee, becomes 
the only car manufacturer to 
date to receive platinum certi-
fication under the LEED® 
(Leadership in Energy and En-
vironmental Design) green 
building certification system.
December 2011
duH requests labelling change
German Environment Aid (DUH) issues a cease-and-desist 
letter to Volkswagen for “misleading advertising”, accusing 
the Company of dishonest use of a current energy efficiency 
labelling system in its communications. The German regu-
lations on fuel consumption labelling for passenger cars use 
an eight-point scale from A+ (very efficient) to G (ineffi-
cient). Volkswagen had mistakenly rated its models using  
a nine-point scale, which also included a category “H”. 
December 2011
€1.6 million for moorland conservation fund

the German Nature and 
Biodiversity Conservation 
Union�(NABU)�jointly�es-
tablish a German moor-

Independent Assurance Report
To Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg
We have been engaged by Volkswagen AG of Wolfsburg to per-
form an independent assurance1 engagement to attain moder-
ate assurance  in respect of observing the AA1000 Account-
Ability principles and in respect of individual quantitative 
sustainability data selected by Volkswagen AG in the Sustaina-
bility Report 2011 (the “Sustainability Report”).
Responsibility of the legal representatives
It is the responsibility of the legal representatives of the Com-
pany
•�to�comply�with�the�principles�of�inclusivity,�materiality�and�re-
sponsiveness as defined in AccountAbility Principles Standard 
(2008) (the “AA1000 AccountAbility Principles”), and
•�to�prepare�the�sustainability�information�in�the�Sustainability�
Report in accordance with the criteria set out in the Sustain-
ability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (pages 7 to 17) of the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the conception, implementation 
and maintenance of systems and processes for ensuring com-
pliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and to pre-
pare the CSR Report using assumptions and estimations that 
are appropriate under the given circumstances.
Responsibility of the auditor
Our responsibility is to form an opinion, based on our assur-
ance procedures, on whether facts have come to our attention 
leading us to assume that in all material respects
•�the� systems� and� processes� installed� by� the� Company� are� not�
appropriate for compliance with the AccountAbility Principles 
of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness; or
•�the�selected�quantitative�sustainability�information�set�out�in�
the Sustainability Report has not been prepared in compli-
ance with the criteria set out in the Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (p. 7 to p.17) of the Global Reporting Initia-
tive (GRI) 
The quantitative sustainability information 2011 selected by 
Volkswagen AG included in our engagement can be found on 
pages 78 to 87 of the Sustainability Report, excluding the Em-
ployee Opinion Survey, Absenteeism and Employee Turnover at 
the Volkswagen Group.  
We also have been engaged to report on recommendations for 
the further development of Corporate Responsibility (CSR) 
Management and CSR Reporting.
We conducted our independent assurance engagement in ac-
cordance with AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS) 2008 
and also in accordance with the International Standard on As-
surance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. 
These standards require that we fulfil our professional duties 
and plan and conduct the engagement in accordance with the 
principle of materiality so that we can form an opinion with 
moderate assurance1 which is the degree of assurance that was 
required by Volkswagen AG. We are independent as defined by 
Section 3.2 of AA1000AS (2008). 
Due to our expertise and experience with non-financial infor-
mation, sustainability management and social and ecological 
issues, we have the competencies required to conduct this inde-
pendent assurance engagement. 
An independent assurance engagement performed to obtain 
moderate assurance is less substantial in scope than an inde-
pendent assurance engagement performed to obtain high as-
surance2, with the result that a corresponding lower level of as-
surance is obtained. The selection of the issues to be examined 
is at the discretion of the auditors performing the engagement, 
exercising all due care and diligence. 
With regard to compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility Prin-
ciples, our examination procedures included the following:
•�discussions�with�management
•�understanding�the�relevant�documentation
•�samples�to�obtain�evidence�of�the�implementation�and�appro-
priateness of the relevant systems and processes 
With regard to the selected sustainability information in the 
Sustainability Report, our work included the following exami-
nations:
•�discussions�with�the�employees�responsible�for�the�reporting�
of sustainability information
•�examination�of�the�systems�and�processes�for�the�compilation,�
calculation and reporting of sustainability information
•�functional� examination� of� the� controls� for� the� assurance� of�
data quality
•�analytical�assessment�of�selected�sustainability�data

(Audi AG), Baunatal (Volkswagen AG), Pamplona (VW Navarra),

vakia). 
Material findings and judgments
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
inclusivity:
•�Internal�documentation�and�publicly�accessible�information�
exist that describe the identification and analysis of impor-
tant stakeholders and state various obligations vis-à-vis 
stakeholders.
•�Volkswagen�AG�has�set�up�a�procedure�that�provides�for�involv-
 1“Moderate assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “limited assurance” as specified by ISAE 3000.
 2“High assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “reasonable assurance” as specified by ISAE 3000.
ing stakeholders in decision-making processes on issues re-
lating to sustainability.
•�In�the�process�of�stakeholder�participation�at�Volkswagen�AG,�
internal stakeholders are included in the form of brands and 
regions by means of an annual meeting of the executive bodies 
with their sustainability coordinators. 
•�Volkswagen� AG� has� sufficient� competencies� and� resources�
available at the Group level to identify and include stakehold-
ers. The brands and regions have only limited competencies 
and resources to ensure the identification and inclusion of 
stakeholders throughout the organization. 
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
materiality: 
•�With�the�use�of�internal�documentation�and�discussions�with�man-
agement, evidence was found of definitive components of the pro-
cedure for ascertaining the materiality of sustainability issues.
•�The�sustainability�issues,�objectives�and�methods�of�the�Volk-
swagen Group were not fully communicated to the brands and 
regions.
•�We�inspected�the�process�for�defining�the�relevance�and�sig-
nificance of the sustainability issues found in the Sustainabil-
ity Report. The determination of the significance and rele-
vance of sustainability issues is based on suitable criteria and 
is complete and understandable.
•�The�topics�of�internal�materiality�processes,�report�evaluation�
of the CSR Report 2010 and the stakeholder workshops were 
prioritized in the report. 
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
responsiveness: 
•�Internal�documents�prove�that�Volkswagen�AG�has�set�up�pro-
cedures for reacting to sustainability issues that are also  
important to stakeholders. The brands and regions of the 
Volkswagen Group do not have procedures for standardized 
reactions to stakeholder inquiries. 
•�On�a�sample�basis,�we�were�able�to�determine�a�verifiable�and�
balanced reaction to the concerns of stakeholders of Volks-
wagen AG.
•�We� determined� that� suitable� guidelines� for� sustainability� re-
porting are in use in the form of the GRI principles (General 
Reporting Initiative). 
Based on our moderate assurance engagement to obtain mod-
erate assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that, in all material respects, the systems and pro-
cesses implemented by the Company are not suitable to adhere 
to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, material-
ity and responsiveness.
Furthermore, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that, in all material respects, the selected quantitative 
sustainability information of the Sustainability Report has not 
been prepared in accordance with the abovementioned criteria 
of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (p. 7 to p. 17) of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
Recommendations
Without qualifying the opinions on our audit stated above, we 
make the following recommendations to further develop sus-
tainability management and sustainability reporting:
Recommendations regarding the principle of inclusivity:
•�The� participation� and� clear� inclusion� of� the� brands� and� re-
gions in the stakeholder management of VW AG should be 
strengthened further and intensified.
•�The�identification�and�inclusion�of�the�stakeholders�should,�in�
addition, be systematically further developed in the brands 
and in the regions and supported by the Group in terms of its 
content. 
Recommendations regarding the principle of materiality:
•�The� brands� and� regions� should� be� more� closely� linked� with�
the�objectives�of�Strategy�2018.
•�The� evaluation� of� the� results� of� the� internal� materiality� pro-
cess as well as the discussions with stakeholders should be de-
veloped and systematized further. 
Recommendations regarding the principle of responsiveness: 
•�The�procedures�for�standardized�reactions�to�stakeholder�in-
quiries should be gradually implemented in the brands and 
regions.
We further recommend:
•�The�company's�dynamic�and�globality�should�take�into�account�
the continuous further development of the Group-wide sus-
tainability management.
•�The� systematic� and� continuous� integration� of� sustainability�
aspects in the core processes of the Company. 
•�The�gradual�and�Group-wide�further�development�of�the�con-
trol system, such as the standardization of data collection and 
evaluation and the internal control system. 
•�The�further�Group-wide�automation�of�data�consolidation,�e.g.�
by using higher level IT systems to report sustainability data.
•�Regular� reviews� of� the� set� of� key� performance� indicators� for�
sustainability reporting and, if necessary, the addition of fur-
ther relevant performance indicators, e.g. in the area of sup-
plier management.
•�Regular�reviews�of�compliance�with�process�standards�for�the�
internal reporting of sustainability data.

Content
This report contains information about the sustainability 
activities of the Volkswagen Group in 2012. Following an in-
troductory chapter identifying the Group’s basic strategic 
principles, the Economy, Society and Environment chap-
ters illustrate the three central dimensions of sustainabili-
ty. Each chapter outlines principles of sustainability at 
Volkswagen, using specific measures and projects initiated 
by the various Group brands to illustrate them. The key sus-
tainability indicators are set out on page 134ff., while the 
Background chapter starting on page 155 includes informa-
tion on reporting standards and their verification. 
The reporting period extends from February 15, 2012, 
when the previous report went to press, to March 1, 2013. 
The key indicators, however, relate to the 2012 calendar 
year. Volkswagen has published its Sustainability Report 
on an annual basis since 2011. The next report will be pub-
lished in the second quarter of 2014. 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the 
standards of Germany’s Institute for Ecological Econo-
my Research (IÖW) and the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI). It has also been verified in line with the interna-
tionally recognised Stakeholder Engagement Standard 
AccountAbility 1000 AS (AA1000). This confirms the reli-
ability of the reporting and the engagement of stake-
holders in the reporting process (> p. 22). Certification 
to this effect can be found in the Background chapter. 
Use of language
All the information in this report relates to the Volkswagen 
Group as a whole. If any information relates to individual 
Group brands only, this is expressly stated. See also the

Dear Reader,
Volkswagen can look back on a very successful fiscal year 
in 2012. Despite economic headwinds, our Group report-
ed new record figures. With 9.3 million vehicles deliv-
ered, we were able to sell one million more vehicles than 
in the previous year while at the same time increasing our 
operating profit to €11.5 billion. 
We at Volkswagen are proud of these successes. At the same 
time, however, they give rise to major responsibilities – for 
our employees and customers, for an intact environment 
and for balanced social development. As Europe’s largest 
automobile manufacturer we take these responsibilities 
seriously – as we showed once again in 2012. 
We are aligning the entire Group with the goals of maxi-
mum energy- and resource efficiency. In this way we will be 
able to cut the average CO2 emissions of our entire Euro-
pean new car fleet to below 120 g/km by 2015. And we are 
making rapid progress towards our goal of ensuring that 
our production plants are 25 percent more environmental-
ly compatible by 2018. 
It is not in our nature, however, to rest on our laurels. Con-
sequently, we recently set ourselves even more ambitious 
environmental targets. For example, the Volkswagen Group 
is sparing no effort to cut the average CO2 emissions of its 
European new car fleet to 95 g/km by 2020. To this end we 
are working to optimise the entire spectrum of drivetrain 
options: internal combustion engines, natural gas engines, 
plug-in hybrids and electric drive. The XL1 model, which 
can cover 100 km on one litre of fuel, demonstrates that our 
Group with its 40,000 research and development engi-
neers has the necessary capacity for innovation and the 
passion that it will take to master this challenge. 
Launching innovative technologies does, however, call 
for a sound financial basis. With this in mind, for the Au-
tomotive Division alone, Volkswagen has put together a 
package of investments worth €50.2 billion for the period 
up to 2015. Two thirds of these funds will be flowed into
even more efficient vehicles and technologies, as well as 
into even more environmentally compatible production 
processes at our 100 plants around the world.
For Volkswagen, sustainability has an important social di-
mension. This includes, for example, shaping working 
conditions in line with the principles of “Decent Work”, as 
well as respecting and enhancing minimum standards of 
working conditions. An important part here is played by co-
determination. The fact that the Volkswagen Group’s suc-
cess is paying dividends in many respects is illustrated by 
the development of the workforce. Since 2007 we have cre-
ated more than 100,000 additional new jobs, 30,000 of 
them in Germany. Today we have a total of 550,000 employ-
ees worldwide, including 16,000 young people in 16 coun-
tries who are learning a profession in line with Germany’s 
dual model of vocational education and training.
This report provides information on our sustainability 
strategy and on the many different projects and measures 
in the economic, social and environmental fields. In the 
interests of maximum transparency, we have once again 
had our Sustainability Report certified in accordance 
with the AA1000AS standard. In addition, the Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI) has again awarded this publica-
tion its highest rating “A+”. Moreover, the report com-
plies with the requirements of the German Sustainability 
Code. Our commitment to sustainable development is 
further documented by our inclusion in key international 
indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 
and the FTSE4Good, as well as by our involvement in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project. Through its participation in 
the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest initiative for 
businesses that support sustainability and responsibility, 
Volkswagen also makes a contribution to protecting hu-
man rights and combating corruption.
We invite you to form your own view of the sustainable de-
velopment of our Company and hope you find that this re-
port makes informative reading.

When the new engine plant in Silao, 
Mexico, was opened in January 2013,  
it brought the total number of Volks-
wagen Group production facilities 
worldwide to 100. Additional produc-
tion plants of the Group’s various 
brands are already at the planning or 
construction stage in China, Hun- 
gary, Russia and Mexico. This lays  
the operational foundations for the 
Group to reach its ambitious growth 
targets. By 2018, Volkswagen is aim-
ing to sell more than 10 million vehi-
cles a year, not least by increasing its 
share of the world’s major growth 
markets.

For Volkswagen, growth is not an end in itself but underpins our stability as a company. 
Adopting a modern interpretation of corporate social responsibility, we shape sustainable 
growth.

With the growing prosperity of the emerging economies 
and developing countries, worldwide demand for individu-
al mobility is on the increase. In the years ahead the num-
ber of cars worldwide is set to rise from roughly 1 billion at 
present to around 1.3 billion. As one of the world’s leading 
automobile companies, the Volkswagen Group has a spe-
cial responsibility here. With trendsetting technology and 
social competence, the Company is making its contribu-
tion to a sustainable development which will ensure that 
future generations have at least the same opportunities as 
the present generation.
Volkswagen’s actions are based on a modern understand-
ing of corporate responsibility. One characteristic of this 
is the application of sustainable management as a criteri-
on along the entire value chain. In this way we succeed in 
combining the traditional values of corporate activity with 
the challenges of our time – responsibility and sustaina-
bility in a global perspective. As a group with global oper-
ations, Volkswagen supports social projects through 
worldwide commitment and donations. At the same time 
it integrates this concept into a modern vision built 
around the strategic anchoring of corporate social re-
sponsibility (CSR) and sustainability in the value chain. 
The challenges of the 21st century, especially resource 
conservation and climate protection and intra- and inter-
generation equity, are brought together in our vision of 
responsibility and sustainability. Sustainability calls for a 
balance of economic, environmental and social objec-
tives. Volkswagen’s CSR and sustainability concept en-
sures that, at every stage in the value-added process, the 
Company avoids risks, identifies development opportuni-
ties at an early stage and continues to enhance its reputa-
tion. This balance thus makes a necessary contribution to 
safeguarding the Company’s future and raising its value 
in the long term.  
 9
Thanks to this contribution, sustainability forms an inte-
gral part of our Strategy 2018. By 2018 Volkswagen aims to 
be not only the most profitable, but also the most fascinat-
ing and most sustainable automaker in the world. In prac-
tical terms, this means that Volkswagen will
> deploy intelligent innovations and technologies to be-
come a world leader in customer satisfaction and quality,
> increase unit sales to over 10 million vehicles a year,
> increase its return on sales before tax to at least 8 percent,
> be the top employer across all brands, companies and re-
gions,
> reduce the energy consumption, waste output, solvent 
emissions, water consumption and CO₂ emissions by 25 
percent per vehicle, compared with 2010.
One year after the most extensive ecological restructuring

neva Motor Show in spring 2012, it is time to take stock. By 
2015, Volkswagen will reduce CO₂ emissions in its EU new 
car fleet to under 120 g/km.

The Company is pushing ahead with its high-end green 
technology all over the world, including in particular Chi-
na, India and Brazil. Volkswagen is taking great strides to-
wards its goal of making its factories 25 percent more envi-
ronmentally compatible by 2018. In the past two years alone, 
energy and water consumption per vehicle have been cut 
by around 10 percent. But as Europe’s largest automaker, 
Volkswagen is also paving the way for further resolute pro-
gress. With the full power of the Company and the entire 
spectrum of powertrain options, ranging from combustion 
engines via natural gas propulsion to plug-in hybrids and 
electric cars, Volkswagen is pursuing the goal of reducing 
the CO₂ emissions of its European new car fleet to 95 g/km 
by 2020. Important milestones in strategic environmental

protection include the focus on the entire life cycle of a ve-
hicle and the recording of CO₂ emission data across all up-
stream and downstream areas in line with the Scope 3 In-
ventory (> p. 98, 143).
On the basis of our Strategy 2018, Volkswagen works with 
its stakeholders to identify those topics that are material to 
the company’s long-term viability. In this analytical pro-
cess, Volkswagen evaluates international sustainability 
studies and engages in active dialogue with its stakehold-
ers. These include analysts, politicians and government 
agencies, academia, non-governmental organisations and 
– not least – its employees, customers and suppliers. At 
both brand and Group level, Volkswagen holds extensive 
discussions on major challenges for the Company and the 
automobile industry. Materiality analysis is an ongoing 
process in which internal bodies discuss and assess the 
relative importance of the topics identified. The result is 
the sustainability strategy roadmap: a matrix of the princi-
pal topics (> p. 27).

sustainability management
The criteria for sustainability management of an enter-
prise that now has 12 brands are determined partly by 
growing global challenges such as climate change and re-
source conservation, respect for human rights and social 
involvement, and – as a result – partly by the increasing 
expectations of political and economic stakeholders and 
especially the customer, with regard to quality, transpar-
ency and governance.
Without abandoning the basic principles of a voluntary and 
hence competition-driven approach, it is increasingly a 
matter of establishing a systemic and strategic sustainabil-
ity concept within the Company. In this spirit, CSR means 
“the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on soci-
ety”, as set out in the European Commission’s definition in 
the CSR Strategy 2011 – 2014.
To put this responsibility into practice, Volkswagen has es-
tablished a clear structure. The Group’s Board of Manage-

ment is also the highest-ranking sustainability body in the 
Company (Sustainability Board). It is informed periodically 
about responsibility and sustainability issues by the Group 
CSR & Sustainability Steering Group. This includes top 
managers from central Group business areas, the Group 
Works Council and representatives of the brands and re-
gions. The Steering Group approves the sustainability 
strategy that the Group is pursuing to achieve its goal of be-
ing the world’s most sustainable automaker by 2018. Since 
2006 the CSR Office has been coordinating all relevant ac-
tivities within the Group and the brands, using standard-
ised structures, processes and reporting. It ensures the 
strategic orientation of CSR activities and acts as a steering 
group for the internal management processes and the 
stakeholder dialogue. CSR project teams work on a cross-
sectoral basis on topical issues such as sustainability in 
supplier relations.
Since 2009 there has been a regular international ex-
change of information between the CSR coordinators of all 
brands and regions. For Group-wide coordination of the 
activities of the environmental officers, there is also the 
Group Environmental Conference and the Corporate Envi-
ronment and Energy Steering Group. The appointment of a 
Group Chief Officer for the Environment, Energy and New 
Business Areas paved the way for the ecological restructur-
ing of the Volkswagen Group.
One important milestone in this restructuring process is 
the modular transverse matrix for the brands Volkswagen, 
Audi, SEAT and ŠKODA. This biggest development initia-
tive in the history of the Volkswagen Group was success-
fully introduced in 2012: the modular transverse matrix 
was used as a basis for producing the new Golf, the Audi 
A3, the ŠKODA Octavia and the SEAT Leon. Across the 
Group, forty models based on the modular transverse ma-
trix will go on sale in the next few years.  
 13, 14
One crucial factor in achieving the Group’s ambitious eco-
nomic and environmental objectives is the people who do 
their best for Volkswagen every day. With almost 550,000 
employees, Volkswagen has a special responsibility. In a  
dialogue with its employees, the Volkswagen Group sets 
standards for good work, whether in vocational education 
and training, continuing professional development at 
home and abroad, pioneering remuneration policy or em-
ployee participation. Volkswagen does full justice to this re-
sponsibility (> p. 56 ff.).
With the establishment of the IT-based sustainability man-
agement system and the further integration of the indica-
tor systems, Volkswagen has laid the foundations for full 
and timely CSR and sustainability reporting by the Group. 
Volkswagen responds to increasing shareholder expecta-
tions regarding up-to-date and differentiated presentation 
of the Company’s CSR and sustainability performance with 
the aid of the increased control efficiency and transparen-
cy of the Key Performance Indicator system.
Code of Conduct and policies
The Group-wide Code of Conduct provides Volkswagen em-
ployees with a guide to mastering the legal and ethical chal-
lenges of their daily work. These principles summarise the 
Group’s values, i.e. closeness to the customer, superior per-
formance, value creation, renewability, respect, responsi-
bility and sustainability. Each individual bears equal respon-
sibility for ensuring compliance with the Code.  
 15
Other important guidelines are provided by international 
conventions, laws and internal regulations. In the “Decla-
ration on Social Rights and Industrial Relationships at 
Volkswagen” (Volkswagen Social Charter), the Charter on

The “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: 
Implementing the United Nations ‘Protect, Respect and 
Remedy’ Framework” have led to the topic of human 
rights being included in the annual compliance risk 
analysis process and for the first time being assessed 
across the Group. Among other things, Volkswagen is 
monitoring the risks in respect of human rights in the 
context of sustainability in the supply chain.

With effect from November 2012, the World Group Works 
Council, the Group Board of Management and the Inter-
national Metalworkers’ Federation reaffirmed their com-
mitment to the Social Charter that has been in force since 
2002 thereby underlining its importance for the Volks-
wagen Group on the way to becoming the top employer. In 
the recently signed version, under the heading of Com-
pensation and Benefits the wording was made more pre-
cise in order to clarify the existing ruling and ensure the 
unequivocal interpretation of the remuneration stand-
ard. The wording now runs: “The compensation and ben-
efits paid or received for a normal work week correspond 
at least to the legally valid and guaranteed minimum. In 
case legal or collective bargaining regulations are not ex-
istent, branch specific tariff compensation and benefits 
are used as an orientation that are customary to the re-
spective location and ensure an appropriate standard of 
living for the employees and their families.” The Social 
Charter is available in twelve languages (> p. 69).  
 18
Since 2002, Volkswagen has been committed to the world’s 
largest and most important CSR initiative, the Global Com-
pact. The 7,000 participating companies in over 135 coun-
tries work together to shape a more sustainable and equita-
ble world economy. Volkswagen makes an important 
contribution here, and in 2012 it attained Global Compact 
Advanced Level status.

volkswagen in sustainability ratings and indexes
Because analysts and investors regard CSR and sustainabili-
ty as leading indicators of forward-looking corporate leader-
ship, they are increasingly basing their recommendations 
and decisions not just on companies’ business performance 
but also on their CSR and sustainability profiles. In particu-
lar, they are using sustainability ratings to assess a compa-
ny’s environmental, social and economic performance. If a 
company achieves top scores in these ratings, this not only 
sends a clear signal to its stakeholders, but also makes the 
company more attractive as an employer and boosts its em-
ployees’ motivation.
In 2012, as in previous years, Volkswagen once again succeed-
ed in maintaining a leading position in its sector in the main 
international ratings and indexes. Volkswagen is one of only 
three automobile companies listed in the Dow Jones Sustain-
ability World Index. MAN is the only German company in the 
mechanical engineering sector of the Dow Jones Sustainabil-
ity World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe In-
dex. Moreover, the Norwegian insurance company Store-
brand has included Volkswagen in its new Trippel Smart and 
The new XL1 from Volkswagen made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show. With fuel consumption of 0.9l/100 km it is the world’s most economi-
cal production model. With its plug-in hybrid powertrain, this two-seater can cover up to 50 km in all-electric mode with zero local emissions.

Dealing with long-term mega-trends and 
short-term influences
In order to achieve its operational and strategic growth ob-
jectives and to stabilise its success on a sustainable basis, 
the Group implements a systematic planning and strategy 
process. The advantages of long-term planning are obvi-
ous: it permits proactive allocation of resources and allows 
the Company to make full use of savings – while maintain-
ing a high degree of quality awareness.
However, long-term planning in the Volkswagen Group also 
needs to be flexible: the economy is subject to cyclical fluctu-
ations, national markets are governed by legal regulations, 
and new customer needs can quickly emerge and become 
important. The main drivers of social change are the global 
mega-trends.
The mega-trends of relevance to the Group are progressive 
urbanisation, demographic change (ageing society) and the 
issue of resource depletion (fossil fuels, rare earths, etc.). 
These trends are increasingly producing changes in custom-
er purchasing. The emerging middle class is demanding 
new products and innovative solutions – and at the same 
time the state is imposing new regulations that have a mas-
sive influence on day-to-day business.
strategy and process
Within the Volkswagen Group several departments are 
constantly at work on long-term planning: observing social 
mega-trends, analysing overall economic framework con-
ditions, tracking emerging customer trends and analysing 
the competition, and merging all these aspects in a single 
process.
This process, known within the Group as the “planning 
round”, makes it possible to take important decisions on 
the development of production, procurement and sales 
structures within a 10-year time frame. However, to take 
adequate account of the increasing pace of change, every 
planning round is updated and adjusted as the year goes on 
until the next planning round starts in the autumn.
Outlook
Long-term planning is of paramount importance for a 
globally operating group like Volkswagen – but in view of 
real-world developments must remain capable of modifi-
cation and adjustment. This is the only way to achieve our 
objective of sustainable growth. The Group is therefore 
continuously refining its forecast toolbox and − specifically 
in the field of market research − undertaking a fundamen-
tal redevelopment of these tools in response to the dynam-
ic changes in the various markets.

“I’d like to see Volkswagen focusing more strongly on areas 
marked by conflicting objectives. Take electric mobility, for 
example: here, Volkswagen could present a comparison of 
stakeholder and customer wishes with what is currently 
technically feasible.”
“I’d like to know exactly what Volkswagen has done to 
investigate the 12 cases in which suppliers are suspected of 
infringements.  This is an area where Volkswagen is too 
superficial in its coverage.”

As a company with worldwide operations, Volkswagen is 
engaged in a permanent exchange of information with the 
various interest groups or stakeholders. As well as custom-
ers, employees and suppliers, these include actors from the 
political world, science and research, civil society and non-
governmental organisations. They all have expectations, 
and they all express interests. Volkswagen in its turn takes 
note of their suggestions and learns from this exchange. 
stakeholder management
Exchange means give and take. Here Volkswagen follows 
a systematic and organised process. The Company basi-
cally believes in an open and constructive dialogue in 
which it can pursue its interests in a targeted way. The 
outcome of this process should be at least a mutual under-
standing of the different starting points and positions – 
and preferably agreement on the possible shape of a 
jointly addressed solution, which should ideally be sup-
ported by a joint project.
The stakeholder dialogue is backed up by a management 
approach that ensures documentation and plausibility. 
Within the limits of the Group approach, brands and re-
gions act on an independent and decentralised basis. The 
right methods for communication and the exchange plat-
forms are selected jointly with the stakeholders. Whether 
it be workshops, symposia, public controversies or social 
media tools – what matters is making progress towards a 
solution. In our internal management, steering groups 
and project groups ensure that all necessary departments 
are involved in order to guarantee transparency and  
effectiveness. In 2013, stakeholder management in the  
Volkswagen Group will become even more systematic 
thanks to an IT-based “Issue and Stakeholder Module”, 
which will firmly establish it within the Company’s organi-
sation.  
In an ongoing process, Volkswagen conducts an employee 
opinion survey to appraise the views of the workforce and 
350,000 employees took part in 2012. At several Volkswagen 
plants, Neighbourhood Forums have been set up to pro-
vide a platform for permanent dialogue with local resi-
dents and local government agencies. At brand and Group 
levels a variety of instruments are available with which to 
conduct stakeholder surveys and implement dialogue fo-
rums. And for customer communications there is also a 
standardised process which ensures that suggestions and 
complaints are dealt with promptly and without exception 
by the specialist departments responsible.

“Volkswagen is right to say that sustainable mobility must 
involve more than just cars. But how far has Volkswagen really 
progressed in this process? What risks does this involve for 
Volkswagen?”
“It’s not enough to focus solely on the topic of efficiency. High 
unit sales ultimately lead to a rebound effect that Volkswagen 
ought to discuss.”
For Volkswagen, playing an active part in national and in-
ternational business networks is a major element in its 
permanent dialogue with important groups and actors. 
Volkswagen contributes its technical and social capabili-
ties here and supports numerous projects. The Group is 
represented on the board of the leading European busi-
ness network for corporate social responsibility, CSR Eu-
rope. At a national level, Volkswagen is represented on the 
boards of econsense, the Forum for Sustainable Develop-
ment of German Business and of the international Biodi-
versity in Good Company initiative. Along with numerous 
other companies, Volkswagen has signed the “Code of Re-
sponsible Conduct for Business” initiative.  
 20
Since 2002, Volkswagen has been committed to the 
world’s largest and most important CSR initiative, the 
Global Compact. The 7,000 participating companies in 
over 135 countries work together to shape a more sustain-
able and equitable world economy. Volkswagen makes a 
significant contribution to this initiative. Ten principles 
under the headings of human rights, labour standards, 
environmental protection and anti-corruption describe 
the values of the Global Compact. In 2012 the Company 
once again reached “Global Compact Advanced Level”, 
gearing its business activities to the principles of the 
Global Compact at all its locations. With its expertise, 
Volkswagen also helps other companies in the Global 
Compact to embrace their global responsibility. One ex-
ample of this is our ongoing participation in the advisory 
board for the “Sustainable Supplier Chain” project.  
Volkswagen is also committed to the follow-up activities 
for the UN sustainability conference Rio+20, and to the 
activities of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development.  
 21
For twelve years now, Volkswagen and the German Nature 
and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) – Germany’s 
largest environmental protection organisation – have 
been engaged in a unique form of cooperation. It is based 
on mutual respect for different interests. The cooperation 
consists of three components: consultation, dialogue and 
projects. Within this framework, Volkswagen and NABU 
raise public awareness of issues relating to sustainability 
and the environment, not least through the fuel-saver 
courses organised in conjunction with NABU.  
 22
The fleet management project with Volkswagen Leasing 
GmbH is a success story from both an environmental and an 
economic point of view. Using the most efficient vehicles re-
duces not only CO2 emissions, but also fleet operators’ costs. 
The project is also a particularly effective form of climate 
change mitigation, since it provides funds for protecting 
moorlands in Germany, which are major CO2 sinks.  
 23
Volkswagen recently concluded a strategic partnership with 
the German Red Cross (DRK). The aim of the collaboration 
is to motivate people to embrace responsible conduct and 
engage in social welfare activities. Both parties are especial-
ly keen to foster a stronger ambulance service. In addition, 
Volkswagen pursues a series of dialogues at expert level – as 
described in the various chapters of this report. 
sustainability reporting
Volkswagen deliberately seeks a dialogue with certain 
stakeholders not least to obtain feedback about the rele-
vance and quality of its sustainability reporting. For exam-
ple, the reporting year marked the eighteenth consecutive 
year in which our reporting has been systematically im-
proved through target-group surveys and active stakehold-
er dialogue. This dialogue continued with the evaluation of 
our 2011 Sustainability Report and the establishment of a 
Sustainability Panel. The aim here is to document positive 
and − in particular − negative feedback on the Volkswagen 
Sustainability Report and thereby identify concrete areas 
for improvement. The four statements at the bottom of 
these two pages, provided by way of example, reflect the 
wide range of opinions and the diversity of the dialogue.

Materiality matrix: 
from dialogue to action.
in a proCeSS baSeD on in-Depth analySiS, VolKSWagen DeFineS the topiCS 
to be uSeD aS Criteria For itS SuStainability Strategy.
From its dialogue with stakeholders and many other ap-
proaches and instruments – ranging from future research to 
internal environmental radar – Volkswagen gathers impor-
tant findings about what society expects of the Company. 
These findings are analysed and assessed in a standardised 
multidimensional process, in terms of both their impor-
tance for our stakeholders and their significance with re-
gard to Volkswagen’s long-term viability. At the same time, 
the extent to which a topic can be influenced by the Com-
pany is also taken into account. The result is a matrix of the 
principal topics – the materiality matrix, a roadmap for 
the Volkswagen sustainability strategy.
Analysis
The wide-ranging topics and ambitions are registered and 
systematically assessed in the relevant sustainability man-
agement units at Group and brand level – including the of-
fice of the CSR & Sustainability Steering Group and the 
technical departments in the fields of Group external rela-
tions, environment, human resources and compliance/ 
governance. This also includes coordination with the 
rules and conventions that Volkswagen is committed to, 
e.g. not only fundamental standards such as the UN Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights or the European Con-
vention on Human Rights, but also the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Furthermore, 
potential topics are checked for compliance with the prin-
ciples of the Global Compact and the internal Volkswagen 
standards – e.g. the Volkswagen Social Charter, the Char-
ter on Labour Relations, the Charter on Temporary Work 
and the Volkswagen Environmental Principles. Recent 
scientific articles and studies are also taken into account 
when assessing the materiality of individual topics. Volks-
wagen Group Research is also closely involved in this 
work. The outcome of the materiality definition process is 
discussed in internal bodies – also in a standardised pro-
cess with predefined communication paths. The final se-
lection is made by the CSR & Sustainability Steering 
Group.

Throughout the concentration process Volkswagen is 
guided by the principal requirements – Inclusivity, Ma-
teriality and Responsiveness – of the AA1000 AccountA-

responds systematically to stakeholder initiatives and 
draws up the materiality matrix taking due account of 
stakeholder expectations. Accordingly, Volkswagen not 
only carried on an intensive stakeholder dialogue in the 
reporting year (> p. 22 ff.), but also discussed the result-
ing materiality matrix with its stakeholders. As part of 
this process, Volkswagen engages in targeted research and 
analysis of negative ecological and social impacts of the 
Company’s activities.
Outcome
The materiality matrix 2012 shows how Volkswagen assess-
es different topics in the light of these factors. The further 
right a topic is located within the matrix, the greater is its 
importance for the future viability and success of the Com-
pany. The closer it is to the top of the matrix, the greater its 
importance for the stakeholders. At the same time, the ma-
trix takes account of the extent to which a topic can be in-
fluenced by Volkswagen. While all topics in the matrix are 
important, special priority for the purposes of the sustain-
ability strategy is assigned to those topics which Volks-
wagen can directly influence – in other words topics to-
wards the top right of the matrix. Accordingly, these topics 
also determine the structure of this report, while other rel-
evant topics, such as water, appear in an overall list pub-
lished on the Internet. This analysis of materiality ensures 
that Volkswagen reports on the key social and ecological 
impacts of its operations. Opportunities and risks in re-
spect of the Company’s performance and competitiveness 
are set out in the various chapters of the report and specific 
goals and actions derived from them. 
Reporting time frame
As a rule the analysis of important topics is completed by the 
end of the third quarter of a reporting year – though it must 
be remembered that the stakeholder dialogue is constantly 
generating new topics which have to be taken into account. 
Once the materiality matrix has been drawn up and dis-
cussed with strategic stakeholder partners, it is approved by 
the CSR & Sustainability Steering Group. On the basis of 
this matrix, the individual sectors are approached during 
the final quarter of the year and asked to supply facts and 
figures. A meticulously documented editorial process then 
prepares this material for sustainability reporting. Among 
other things, this observes the principles of the Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI). External stakeholders and analyti-
cal and consulting companies are involved in the editorial 
process. The Sustainability Report itself – complete with the 
relevant online microsite – is then presented to the public 
at the Annual General Meeting.

At the North German port of Emden, commercial success takes on tangible form.  
Every year, more than 1.2 million vehicles from almost all Volkswagen Group brands  
pass through the port, inbound and outbound. That’s 800 shiploads... and rising.

is the margin by which profit after tax increased in the reporting 
year, reaching €21,884 million. Sales revenues were also up by 
20.9 percent to €192,676 million. And at €11.5 billion, operating 
profit exceeded the previous year’s record level of €11.3 billion.
+38.5%
Higher vehicle sales, higher sales revenue and higher operating profit: in the reporting 
year the Volkswagen Group outperformed the record level of the previous year. As a result, 
the Group is firmly on course to reach its ambitious growth targets – and sustainably secure 
its long-term viability.  
The total procurement volume for the 
Volkswagen Group in the reporting year 
amounted to €128.7 billion. This repre-
sents an increase of 16.8 percent over  
the previous year.
The figures include the procurement  
volume for Porsche from August 2012 
and for MAN from November 2011. The 
procurement volume for Audi includes 
the brands lamborghini and Ducati 
(from August 2012).

CUstOMER sAtIsFACtION
Customer satisfaction – satisfaction with products, servic-
es and performance – is a cornerstone of Volkswagen’s 
corporate strategy, laying the foundation for long-term, 
sustainable success. Knowing customers’ needs and ex-
pectations, and learning more about them by maintaining 
an ongoing dialogue with customers, is a top priority for 
Volkswagen. In this respect, alongside excellent products 
and expert advice, personal contact with the customer is of 
critical importance. Particularly when it comes to the 
Group’s new sustainability measures, customer satisfac-
tion is a key indicator of how well product developments 
and model updates are responding to stakeholder needs. 
Consequently, customer satisfaction is a key component of 
the Group’s Strategy 2018, and is reflected in the strategies 
of all the individual brands. And the Group sets itself the 
highest possible goals in this respect: Volkswagen aims to 
do more than just satisfy its customers – it aims to delight 
and inspire them. Reflecting this priority, the Board of 
Management receives updates on all customer-related ac-
tivities as often as six times a year. 
Individual Group brands conduct satisfaction surveys in 
their respective markets, placing special emphasis on cus-
tomer satisfaction ratings related to products and services. 
For product satisfaction, the Porsche and Audi brands lead 
the rankings in their European core markets, compared 
with other Group brands and with their competitors. But in 
terms of overall satisfaction levels, the Group’s other 
brands perform well, too, matching – or outperforming – 
their competitors. Overall, the surveys reveal that well over 
two thirds of all customers are very satisfied with the prod-
ucts of the Volkswagen Group brands. In the European 
core markets, Porsche and Audi rank among the top three 
brands. Volkswagen, ŠKODA and SEAT score satisfaction 
ratings in excess of 90 percent – far above the market aver-
age. In the USA, Porsche and Audi lead the field, occupying 
the no. 1 and no. 2 positions. In China, Audi, ŠKODA and 
Volkswagen set the standards in terms of product satisfac-
tion, scoring over 95 percent. Volkswagen and ŠKODA are 
also setting the pace for dealer satisfaction in China, rank-
ing at no. 1. Volkswagen Group customers are loyal to the 
brands because they are satisfied with the products and 
services. Brand loyalty ratings, which are calculated on a 
regular basis, show how much customers trust the respec-
tive brands: the Volkswagen passenger car brand, for ex-
ample, has maintained a high level of brand loyalty in its 
European core markets for several successive years now. 
ŠKODA’s customers are very loyal, too: the brand has also 
maintained a leading ranking compared with its competi-
tors for a number of years.  
 31
Volkswagen’s market research evaluates customer satisfac-
tion – in comparison with the Group’s competitors – while at 
the same time gathering detailed information through to 
dealership level. Depending on the specific context for the re-
search, various survey methods are used – both face-to-face 
and telephone interviews, and written and online surveys. For 
legal reasons, Volkswagen is not authorised to publish specific 
management-related external customer satisfaction data. 
Methodically and systematically measuring the brands’ 
performance in this key area provides a sound basis for con-
tinually improving the customer process. Yet Volkswagen 
has gone a stage further, too, introducing a unique initiative 
that actively includes the customer in the product process. 
Since 2011, the brand’s target market has been invited to 
contribute to the product design process. The “People’s Car 
Project” gives customers in China the opportunity to pre-
sent their ideas for design, customisation and connectivity

via an online platform. The response has been phenomenal 
– the website has had more than 33 million Chinese visitors, 
and more than 119,000 ideas have been submitted. Origi-
nally scheduled to run for one year, the project has now 
been extended indefinitely. In other words Volkswagen is 
making cars not just for its customers but also with its cus-
tomers, in a process that yields an in-depth insight into cus-
tomers’ needs and preferences. In this way, Volkswagen is 
aiming to ensure that it ranks as one of the world’s top three 
automakers for customer satisfaction by 2018.  
 32
Audi’s Board of Management regularly discusses product 
and satisfaction requirements in its “Kundentisch” cus-
tomer forum, with the aim of understanding background 
trends and influences, and optimising business processes. 
Audi City, an entirely new concept, was introduced in order 
to build even closer customer relationships, to showcase 
the full spectrum of products in a highly emotive way, and 
to discover customer needs. This innovative space for in-
teraction between brand, customer and product provides 
digital access to all the brand’s models in life size and in 
real time. With its state-of-the-art technology, Audi City 
perfectly expresses the ethos of the Audi world, offering 
customers the live experience of a next-generation show-
room. In 2012, Audi City showrooms were opened in Lon-
don and Beijing; the brand plans to roll out the concept 
worldwide.  
 33
Focusing on the customer, then, is not just the basis of the 
Volkswagen Group’s actions, but a core element of its strate-
gy. Because only products and services of outstanding quality 
that ensure a high level of customer satisfaction can guaran-
tee long-term market success. One key factor here is meeting 
the specific needs of consumer groups, for example by pro-
ducing special-purpose vehicles for the disabled. Superior 
vehicle safety and state-of-the-art driver assistance systems 
are also relevant considerations in this respect. 
 34, 35
Identifying and understanding customer wishes and needs holds the key to customer satisfaction. One positive example here is the People’s 
Car Project in China, in which visitors to an online platform were asked to submit their car design ideas. With 33 million visitors and over 
119,000 suggestions submitted, the project has exceeded all expectations. Three of the car and technology concepts put forward and taken 
up by Volkswagen were presented at the Auto China 2012 fair. Among them was the Music Car, which changes colour depending on the  
music that the driver selects.

Another decisive aspect is fair pricing. Take ŠKODA for ex-
ample: with the new Rapid, a locally produced version of 
which was launched on the Indian market in 2011, the 
ŠKODA brand presented a compact notchback saloon, spe-
cially designed for international growth markets like Chi-
na and Russia, as well as price-sensitive customer seg-
ments in Europe. Like the up! at the Volkswagen brand, the 
four-door Citigo supplements the ŠKODA offering in the 
expanding small car segment.  
sUstAINABILItY IN sUPPLIER RELAtIONs
Against the backdrop of the ongoing growth and diversifi-
cation of the supply chain, Volkswagen believes it has a re-
sponsibility to promote sustainability throughout the en-
tire value-added process. The aim of the Volkswagen 
Group is to achieve globally stable, efficient and sustaina-
ble goods and supply chains that ensure security of supply. 
To this end, as long ago as 2006, Volkswagen developed 
and implemented the “Sustainability in supplier rela-
tions” concept. Since then the concept has been subject to 
ongoing external evaluation and improvement.
Concept
By implementing this concept, Volkswagen ensures that its 
business partners, too, observe environmental and social 
standards. In this context, Volkswagen attaches great im-
portance to a fair and open dialogue in a spirit of partner-
ship. The concept essentially rests on four pillars:
1)  Sustainability requirements for suppliers that have to be 
acknowledged by all suppliers before submitting a quo-
tation. No company can submit a quotation without ac-
knowledging these requirements.
2) An early warning system for identifying and minimis-
ing risks along the value chain. 
3) Integration into the procurement process.
4) Supplier monitoring and development.
sustainability requirements
The “Sustainability in supplier relations” concept is based 
on the “Volkswagen Group requirements for sustainability 
in relations with business partners”, which are signed by 
the Group’s Procurement Director and the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer. The Volkswagen Group expects its 
business partners to observe these requirements and to re-
quire them from their own business partners. The require-
ments apply to all goods and services purchased. The 
Group rejects any behaviour that is corrupt or damaging to 
the Company in everyday transactions, and also any failure 
to comply with environmental and social standards. Com-
pliance with competition and anti-trust legislation is ex-
pected and verified.  
 37
The “Volkswagen Group requirements for sustainability in 
relations with business partners” set out Volkswagen’s ex-
pectations concerning its business partners’ conduct with 
regard to central environmental and social standards. 
Among other things, the requirements are based on obser-
vance of internationally recognised human rights, the Unit-
ed Nations Global Compact, the International Chamber of 
Commerce Business Charter for Sustainable Development 
and the OECD guidelines for sustainable long-term develop-
ment. Moreover, the relevant core labour standards of the 
International Labour Organisation ILO form the founda-
tions of the Volkswagen sustainability requirements. These 
include observing the right to freedom of opinion, protec-
tion from arbitrary decisions, the ban on discrimination at 
work, the prohibition of forced labour and child labour, the 
fundamental right to freedom of association and the right to 
equal treatment and appropriate remuneration. 
These principles are supplemented by Volkswagen’s envi-
ronmental policy, the resulting environmental targets and 
requirements, the Group’s quality policy and the Volks-
wagen declaration on social rights. All suppliers are made 
aware of the binding requirement to implement a sustaina-
bility strategy. This is done in a variety of ways. Thus, for 
some years now we have been taking environmental targets 
as a basis for awarding contracts; this is done by making VW 
Norm 01155 and VW Norm 99000 parts of the contract and 
co-valid contractual documents. VW Norm 99000, for exam-
ple, explicitly standardises requirements relating to envi-
ronmental impact, recyclability and prohibited materials.
Furthermore, Volkswagen requires its major suppliers to 
have a certified environmental management system in 
Strategy       e co n omy       Soc i e t y       E nvi r on m ent

place in accordance with ISO 14001 and/or EMAS. This has 
been verified and documented for 30 percent of our major 
suppliers. As part of the environmental certification and au-
diting of the Volkswagen AG locations under EMAS and ISO 
14001, regular checks are made on the environmentally rele-
vant suppliers and service providers working on the factory 
sites. Furthermore, together with other automakers we me-
ticulously audit the 250 waste management companies that 
work for the Volkswagen brand’s German locations. The 
waste management contractor first receives a fact-finding 
questionnaire and then has to furnish certificates and per-
mits, e.g. a valid inspection by the technical inspectorate 
TÜV. A detailed checklist is then worked through in the 
course of an on-site inspection. Equipment is thoroughly in-
spected and documents scrutinised. The data is all collected 
in a multi-company portal which in future will also take ac-
count of Europe-wide standards. The Spanish Volkswagen 
location Navarra is already using the portal.

proCurement VolumeS
In the reporting period, Volkswagen purchased goods and services from a total of 21,917 suppliers. Of this total, goods to the value of €67.6 
billion from 7,125 suppliers were for the production sector. This does not include goods to the value of €35.4 billion from suppliers to the Lam-
borghini, Bugatti, Porsche, SCANIA and MAN brands or to ŠKODA India and the Chinese joint ventures. In the field of general procurement, 
goods to the value of €17.2 billion were delivered to Volkswagen by 14,792 suppliers. This does not include goods to the value of €8.9 billion 
from suppliers to the Lamborghini, Bugatti, Porsche, SCANIA and MAN brands or to ŠKODA India and the Chinese joint ventures. In 2012 there 
were 752 new suppliers for the production sector and Volkswagen purchased goods to the value of €1 billion from these suppliers. This does 
not include goods from suppliers to the Lamborghini, Bugatti, Porsche, SCANIA and MAN brands or to ŠKODA India and the Chinese joint ven-
tures. In the general procurement sector there were 5,625 new suppliers, accounting for purchases totalling €4.4 billion. This does not include 
goods from suppliers to the Lamborghini, Bugatti, Porsche, SCANIA and MAN brands or to ŠKODA India and the Chinese joint ventures. Terms 
of payment are an important topic in our dialogue with suppliers. The great majority of payments are made on the 25th calendar day of the 
month following delivery.

THe GROUP BUSINeSS PlATFORM
Raising Company employees’ awareness of sustainability 
aspects along the value chain is a factor of critical impor-
tance, particularly in the procurement sector. Volks-
wagen therefore runs training and information events to 
equip procurement staff with the necessary skills for the 
“Sustainability in supplier relations” concept. Thirteen 
training courses were held at various locations in 2012, 
e.g. for junior Volkswagen brand managers or at the 
ŠKODA Bratislava location. These information events 
supplement the training that all new procurement staff 
undergo in the course of the Company’s knowledge trans-
fer programme. All procurement staff also have access to 
the eLearning tool for suppliers; for more details see the 
section on “Supplier development” (> p. 39).
Risk analysis
The excellent reputation that the company enjoys in the 
business world and in society in general is a valuable as-
set for the Volkswagen Group. To avoid putting this at risk,  
Volkswagen runs an integrity check on new business part-
ners. The aim of this process is to find out more about the 
potential business partner before entering into business 
relations, thereby reducing the risk of a relationship that 
could adversely affect the Group and its business. Before 
being taken on board the Group Business Platform, all 
new business partners are therefore subjected to the 
Business Partner Check (> p. 42).
In order to obtain information about the importance at-
tached to sustainability in certain parts of the world even 
before making the first personal contacts with a poten-
tial new supplier, Volkswagen has performed a country 
risk analysis with the assistance of independent institu-
tions. On the basis of this, Volkswagen sees an increased 
risk of non-compliance with its sustainability require-
ments in Brazil, India, China, Mexico and Russia. 
Conflict minerals are another important issue: Volks-
wagen is concerned about reports of human rights viola-
tions such as forced labour and child labour, the use of 
force and destruction of the environment in the mining 
of minerals, including tin, tantalum (coltan), tungsten 
and gold, e.g. in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and neighbouring states.  
 39
supplier scorecard
Volkswagen uses the supplier scorecard for effective and 
sustainable supply chain management. The scorecard sum-
marises information on individual suppliers in the fields of 
Procurement, Technical Development, Quality Assurance 
and Logistics. This information makes it possible to perform 
a supplier analysis. In addition, the supplier scorecard also 
provides a basis for communication when developing and 
coordinating integrated supplier strategies. The document-
ed sustainability criteria, e.g. records of company certifica-
tion or information about the extent of compliance with the 
sustainability questionnaire, permit conclusions about a 
supplier’s environmental and social standards. 
Integration in the procurement process
The Group Business Platform is the central tool for interac-
tion with suppliers. This is where the Volkswagen Group’s 
central procurement applications are concentrated. In ad-
dition to its interactive functionality for day-to-day business, 
the Group Business Platform is also an information medi-
um. Here suppliers can find out everything they need about 
the “Sustainability in supplier relations” concept. And this  
is where they can access all the sustainability guidelines 
named above.  
 40
As already mentioned, all suppliers have to acknowledge the 
sustainability requirements when submitting their first quo-
tation and at 12-month intervals thereafter. This process is 
integrated into the Group Business Platform.
supplier monitoring
All suppliers are requested to complete the sustainability 
questionnaire. This is posted on the Group Business Plat-
form as a To Do task. By 31 December 2012, 7,812 suppliers 
had answered the questionnaire. In cases where there 
are reasonable grounds for suspicion, possible deviations 
from Volkswagen’s sustainability requirements or unsat-
isfactory answers, the supplier is contacted and asked for 
a written statement based on the “6D Report”, which con-
tains six points to be answered, enabling both the point at 
issue and the remedial measures to be described. This 
statement is then evaluated by experts in the relevant 
field. If the answer is not satisfactory, further steps are

taken. The measures to be initiated are coordinated by 
a)  the ad hoc expert team in Wolfsburg and
b) the expert teams in the relevant brands and regions for 
the suppliers in question. Where necessary, further 
measures are demanded and their implementation 
monitored.
All procurement regions are represented within the pro-
curement sustainability network, ensuring regional cover-
age of the procurement regions and hence of the countries 
in which the suppliers are located. Where suspicions exist, 
ad hoc cases are dealt with in close consultation with the 
representatives of the brands and regions. They, after all, 
are quickly on the spot, speak the local language and may  
already have had contact with the supplier in a different  
context. Depending on the situation, experts from specialist 
areas such as occupational safety and health or human  
resources are called in to handle such ad hoc cases and pro-
vide case-specific and specialist support for their colleagues 
in the procurement network. These ad hoc expert teams are 
maintained in every brand and region. They are supported 
by the ad hoc expert team based in Wolfsburg.
Internal quality process auditors help Procurement to im-

lations” concept. To this end the auditors use a status in-
Building a car takes thousands of parts, manufactured all over the world, assembled with extreme precision and in line with rigorous 
sustainability requirements – all of which would not be possible without binding standards. Volkswagen established these standards 
back in 2006 with its “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept.

dicator (SiSR flag) to perform audits at the suppliers to 
establish whether the supplier has answered the sustain-
ability questionnaire and understood the contents. In 
cases of non-compliance or if the sustainability require-
ments have not been understood, the procurement sus-
tainability network contacts the supplier in question. If 
necessary, e.g. where deficits are detected, an escalation 
process is launched which includes the use of the 6D Re-
port. The 6D Reports are also used to obtain an initial 
statement from the supplier in cases of suspicion arising 
independently of these processes. Here too the above-
mentioned escalation process may be launched if the 
need arises. In 2012 there were a total of eleven ad hoc 
cases in which the dialogue with the supplier resulted in 
compliance with the sustainability requirements. Of 
these, nine were in the social field and two in the environ-
mental sector. Six of the cases occurred in Europe, three 
in Asia and two in South America. 
In all process steps and all measures, the focus is on sup-
plier development, fair dialogue in a spirit of partner-
ship, and ongoing cooperation with the supplier. The 
Volkswagen Group reserves the right to have compliance 
with the sustainability requirements verified by experts at 
the business partner’s premises during regular business 
hours. The Volkswagen Group furthermore reserves the 
right to terminate business relations with suppliers on 
the grounds of non-compliance with the sustainability re-
quirements, especially in cases where the supplier dis-
plays no visible interest in long-term improvement. Dur-
ing the reporting period there was one case in which the 
Volkswagen Group terminated its business relations with 
a supplier because of non-compliance with the sustaina-
bility requirements.
supplier development
In the interests of an ongoing supplier development pro-
cess, Volkswagen makes an eLearning module in nine lan-
guages available to its suppliers on the Group Business 
Platform, or invites them to work through it via the “To Do” 
function on the Platform. In the eLearning module the 
user first learns what requirements Volkswagen has with 
regard to environmental and social standards and what 
Volkswagen’s sustainability requirements are based on. 
The information provided is supplemented by references 
to further reading. After the eLearning course, the suppli-
er has to perform a self-check. The learning module is not 
regarded as “passed” until this check is successfully com-
pleted. As of 31 December 2012, 2,420 supplier locations 
had completed the eLearning course.
Projects in 2012
To ensure worldwide integration of the “Sustainability in 
supplier relations” concept into all the Group’s brands and 
regions, Volkswagen again held an international regional 
meeting in 2012. Some 30 representatives from the global 
procurement regions met in Wolfsburg, not least to share 
examples of best practice. Specific amendments to the con-
cept were decided on the basis of this international dia-
logue.
All the concept’s structures and modules are regularly re-
viewed – e.g. in exchanges with other organisations and 
companies, for example the Forum for Sustainable Devel-
opment of German Business (econsense), the German  
Automobile Industry Association (VDA), the Extractive In-
dustries Transparencies Initiative (EITI) or the European 
Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain Sustainability 
(CSR Europe).

Goals 2013
One important goal is the integration of the Porsche, Sca-
nia, MAN and Ducati brands into the “Sustainability in 
supplier relations” concept. This process is to be complet-
ed in 2013. Volkswagen also plans to expand its supplier 
monitoring and supplier development activities. To this 
end the concept for systematic identification of sustaina-
bility risks in the supply chain will undergo further devel-
opment in a doctoral thesis. This is to be used as a basis for 
more comprehensive identification and more detailed 
analysis of sustainability risks. A further goal is the intro-
duction of more in-depth sustainability audits at suppliers. 
Moreover, special training courses are to be held in 2013 to 
raise supplier awareness of sustainability issues.
The aim is to work exclusively with suppliers who comply 
with all specific sustainability requirements.

ECONOMIC stABILItY
The global economy continued to grow in 2012, but with 
some loss of momentum. Once again, the driving force  
behind this development was the emerging economies, 
which displayed above-average economic growth. In some 
cases, however, growth rates fell short of the previous 
year’s figures. In view of structural barriers, especially ex-
cessive pressures on national budgets and deficits in the 
competitive strength of some countries, the industrialised 
countries achieved only limited expansion.
This split in the development of the global economy will 
continue in 2013. The emerging markets in Asia are likely to 
maintain their role as growth drivers. By contrast, the situ-
ation in the industrialised countries is fraught with uncer-
tainties. Depending on the success of the efforts to bring 
about political reforms, the situation could ease in the USA 
in particular, and also in parts of the Eurozone. While the 
favourable developments of recent weeks on the financial 
and currency markets indicate a certain potential for re-
covery, they are not yet sufficient to indicate that the crisis 
is drawing to a close.
Volkswagen will be faced with considerable challenges. 
These are due partly to global economic trends, and partly 
to the increasing competition in the automotive industry 
and the growing size and complexity of the Company.  
 44
Global economic trends
The relative shifts in the global economy will continue in 
the years ahead. This will be especially true if the tradi-
tional industrialised countries fail to overcome the 
structural problems of their economies and do not take 
full advantage of their already reduced growth potential. 
The BRIC countries in particular will become increas-
ingly significant in both economic and political terms. 
Although the recent slight dip in the pace of growth, es-
pecially in Brazil, indicates a fundamental economic 
vulnerability, the prospects are that the BRIC countries 
will continue to make an above-average contribution to 
the growth of the global economy.
Furthermore, for some years now another group of 
emerging countries has been taking shape in Southeast 
Asia and Latin America, characterised by dynamic growth 
in conjunction with relative political stability. Here too 
the Volkswagen Group sees substantial opportunities in 
terms of unit sales, thanks to the economic advancement 
of broad sections of the population and the associated in-
crease in household incomes.
The shift in the centres of growth is giving rise to an in-
creasingly multi-polar global economy with correspond-
ing impacts on international trade, and also on finance 
flows and the energy and commodity markets. The coun-
tries in question are already exerting considerable influ-
ence on global politics in order to safeguard their eco-
nomic and political interests. 
In view of the lack of progress towards multilateral free-
trade agreements, recent efforts to promote free trade be-
tween individual states and regions offer opportunities for 
market integration. They are helping to ensure that the 
global economy and global trade continue to grow.
Nevertheless, the risk of foreign exchange conflicts and of 
protectionist measures designed to improve national com-
petitive positions in the short term has recently increased. 
There are also considerable risks arising from the struc-
tural deficits in numerous economies – especially with re-
gard to public budgets, the continuing inadequate supervi-
sion and regulation of the international financial markets, 
and the impacts of political and social conflicts.
Increasing competition
Competition continues to intensify on the global automo-
tive markets. Last year, Japanese manufacturers recov-
ered from the natural disasters of 2011 and succeeded in 
recapturing lost market shares. The Korean manufactur-
ers continued their worldwide expansion and increased 
their sales on the EU market, which showed an overall 
downturn. The presence of Chinese automakers on the 
car markets of Western Europe and North America re-
mains insignificant, but they are becoming increasingly 
important in emerging economies.
Against this difficult background, the Volkswagen Group 
succeeded in topping its strong performance in the previ-
Strategy       e co n omy       Soc i e t y       E nvi r on m ent   
 
 
 
 
 
 
41
ous year, supplying more than 9 million vehicles for the 
first time ever. The successful integration of Porsche, 
MAN and Ducati also enlarged and strengthened the 
Group’s product portfolio. The Volkswagen Group is 
therefore confident that it is firmly on course to achieve 
its targets. The increasing strength of new and old com-
petitors provides additional motivation for resolutely pur-
suing our goal of becoming the number one global player 
among car manufacturers by 2018.
Emerging from the crisis with greater responsibilities
Volkswagen emerged from the global economic crisis fast-
er than expected and in a stronger position than its com-
petitors. It is only through responsible and sustainable 
management that the Company has succeeded in main-
taining its progress towards global automotive leadership 
as mapped out in our Strategy 2018. As the Volkswagen 
Group grows in size and complexity, its responsibility for 
the Company and for its employees will continue to in-
crease.
In the years gone by, Volkswagen has successfully stepped 
up its presence in important markets. In view of the glob-
al economic trends and risks already described, it will in 
future be increasingly important to improve the condi-
tions for sustainable growth and to tap new potential.
A large measure of flexibility and financial independence 
is absolutely essential for dealing successfully with busi-
ness downturns and economic crises. The crisis years 
have shown that sustained investment in product, process 
and personnel development pays off, and that this is a key 
factor in the long-term success of the Company. More 
flexible production processes make it possible to ensure a 
rapid response to market changes and prevent misalloca-
tion and surplus capacity. With the introduction of the 
modular transverse matrix last year, the Volkswagen 
Group took a major step towards making production more 
flexible and even more efficient.
The diversification of the product portfolio and a broad 
presence in the global markets help to improve the Com-
pany’s resistance to crises. This can balance out sectoral 
and geographical risks and reduce their impact on the 
Company. Localising valued-added processes to ensure 
accurate catering for customer needs at local level, and 
also to minimise risks arising from currency fluctuations 
and protectionism, must therefore form another central 
element of our corporate strategy. The opening of the 
Group’s 100th factory at Silao in Mexico is a milestone in 
Volkswagen’s localisation efforts.
Volkswagen’s corporate management and culture, tradi-
tionally partnership-based, have proved their worth as 
important factors in absorbing the impacts of economic 
downturns. In particular, the functioning social partner-
ship within the Group made a major contribution to suc-
cessful countermeasures during the last crisis and formed 
the foundation for the Group’s robustness and resilience. 
The willingness of employees and Group management to 
work together to safeguard the Company’s future viability 
is the precondition for a sustainable business model.
Energy-intensive and resource-intensive industries in the 
international competitive arena are faced with the chal-
lenge of reducing emissions and energy consumption. 
The long-term measures to conserve resources and mini-
mise Volkswagen’s environmental footprint are an inte-
gral part of the Group’s strategy. At the same time,  
Volkswagen regards the development of energy-efficient 
production processes and alternative drive systems as an 
opportunity to generate competitive advantages and sus-
tainable growth.
Volkswagen will only achieve sustainable success by tak-
ing more and more responsibility for the environment 
and for social developments, particularly in emerging 
economies. Every single employee has a part to play here: 
through their skills and commitment they shoulder re-
sponsibility for the Group’s ongoing development and fu-
ture success.

COMPLIANCE
In the long term, a business can only succeed in operat-
ing sustainably and doing justice to its global and local 
responsibility if it acts with integrity. Among other things, 
this includes complying with national and international 
rules, dealing fairly with business partners and competi-
tors, and acting in a responsible manner. But voluntary 
undertakings and ethical principles are also elements of 
Volkswagen’s corporate culture – something that all em-
ployees and business partners are expected to respect.  
In 2010 this claim was reaffirmed and set out in the Code of 
Conduct that applies across the Group. These principles 
are designed to provide guidance to all Group employees 
on how to behave responsibly in their day-to-day work. The 
Code of Conduct touches on many facets of corporate sus-
tainable development, not only from an economic and en-
vironmental point of view, but also from a social angle: 
from avoiding conflicts of interests and dealing with busi-
ness partners, via occupational safety and health, to practi-
cal protection of the environment. The individual chapters 
of this report take an in-depth look at these aspects. 
Core values such as integrity and fairness are not only to be 
defined within the Volkswagen Group, but also deliberately 
practised. The purpose of the compliance organisation is 
to support this process. Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, Chair-
man of the Board of Management, had this to say on the 
subject: “Compliance is an issue that plays a major role 
across all national boundaries and business sectors. Volks-
wagen’s business is entirely clean and above board. This is 
a zero tolerance issue; after all, our reputation is at stake!” 
The Volkswagen Group supports measures to combat cor-
ruption and other business crimes both inside and outside 
the Group. Since 2002 Volkswagen, as a member of the Unit-
ed Nations Global Compact, has been working with some 
7,000 participating companies from more than 135 countries 
to make the global economy fairer and more sustainable.
A definition of compliance
For Volkswagen, compliance means acting in accordance 
with the rules. To this end Volkswagen pursues a preven-
tive compliance approach, seeking to maintain and de-
velop a corporate culture that rules out potential infringe-
ments from the outset. To achieve this, steps are taken to 
explain existing rules to Volkswagen Group employees 
and raise awareness of them. This approach is based on 
the contents prescribed in the voluntary auditing stand-
ard of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) 
for the verification of compliance management systems 
(IDW PS 980).  
 45
On the basis of the German Corporate Governance Co-
dex, Volkswagen again ensured that its compliance work 
kept pace with the growth of the Group in the reporting 
year. The work of the Group Chief Compliance Officer is 
supported by Chief Compliance Officers as the persons 
responsible at all the Group’s brands. In the past year the 
number of Compliance Officers in the Group companies 
has risen by 35 to 100. At present more than 400 employ-
ees in 39 countries are working in the integrated govern-
ance, risk & compliance organisation.
As in previous years, the work of the compliance organi-
sation was again supported in 2012 by supra-divisional 
and cross-brand bodies – including the top management 
“Compliance Council” and the “Compliance Core Team”. 
Other compliance bodies are in place within the individ-
ual brands and companies.
the volkswagen Compliance Management system
A standardised governance, risk & compliance (GRC) pro-
cess established throughout the Group is used to identify, 
catalogue and assess potential risks to the Company. The 
special feature of this process is that it combines three as-
pects in one: risk management system, internal audit sys-
tem and compliance management system. Among other 
things, this approach makes it possible to address com-
pliance-relevant issues efficiently in a standardised risk 
management process and to use the resulting findings for 
the Group’s compliance programme.
The effectiveness of key preventive measures for managing 
compliance risks is reviewed annually, which means they 
are subjected to a continuous improvement process. This 
includes taking account of detailed risk assessments per-
formed by the responsible units throughout the Group. The 
Strategy       e co n omy       Soc i e t y       E nvi r on m ent   
 
 
 
 
 
 
43
results are fed into the risk analyses undertaken by the 
Volkswagen Group and its brands and companies and are 
taken into account in the respective compliance pro-
grammes.
The focus topics of the Compliance Management Pro-
gramme 2012 were:
> Preventing active bribery. Here there was a special focus 
on strategically important markets such as Brazil, Rus-
sia, India, China, Malaysia, Argentina and Mexico.
> Implementing an anti-corruption guide which was is-
sued to all managers in Volkswagen AG. With the aid of 
practical examples, the guide raises the reader’s aware-
ness of the issue, provides checklists of corruption risks 
and indicates ways and means of successfully preventing 
corruption. It also includes an explicit ban on “facilita-
tion payments” intended to speed up procedures. The 
guide was made available to the international Group 
brands in multiple languages and as a basis for adapta-
tion, and distributed with a personal covering letter from 
the Chairman of the Board of Management and the 
Group Chief Compliance Officer.
> The Code of Conduct. This is now established in all con-
solidated brands and enshrined in the Group’s corporate 
culture as an essential element. Brochures about the Code 
of Conduct have been distributed to all employees and are 
also available online. The Code of Conduct is also inte-
grated into operating processes. Since 2010, for example, 
new contracts of employment at Volkswagen AG have 
drawn attention to the Code of Conduct and the obligation 
to observe it. This also includes respecting internationally 
recognised human rights.  
 15
> Competition and anti-trust legislation continued to be a 
focus of employee training.  
 46
> The integrity check: the excellent reputation that the 
company enjoys in the business world and society in 
general is a valuable asset for the Volkswagen Group. To 
avoid putting it at risk, Volkswagen runs an integrity 
check on new business partners. The aim is to find out 
more about the potential business partner before enter-
ing into business relations, thereby reducing the risk of 
a relationship that could adversely affect the Group and 
its business.
> Advisory services: In 2012 the compliance organisation 
stepped up its advisory services considerably. Today the 
brands and numerous companies offer their employees 
the opportunity to obtain personal advice, usually via the 
Compliance e-mail address. An IT-based information

and advisory tool was introduced in 2012 and supported 
by extensive publicity. To date it has resulted in some 
12,000 retrievals of articles.
> 2012 also saw the continued development of a money 
laundering prevention strategy. This instrument is based 
on a risk analysis and is structured by business fields. It 
caters for the new requirements of the German Money 
Laundering Act which came into force during the report-
ing year.
training courses and online learning programmes
To ensure sensitive and informed handling of compliance 
issues, employees need to be familiar with the Group’s 
rules and values. Information events for employees at all 
levels in the hierarchy are therefore of central impor-
tance in the context of compliance work. In the course of 
2012 a total of some 45,000 employees throughout the 
Group attended events at which they received training in 
issues relating to compliance, code of conduct, competi-
tion and anti-trust law, and anti-corruption.
Online learning programmes are also an integral part of 
our employee training. In 2012 some 20,000 employees 
successfully completed the online learning programme 
on preventing corruption and avoiding conflicts of inter-
ests. One new module introduced in 2012 was the online 
learning programme on the Group’s Code of Conduct. 
Participation in this has been compulsory for all new em-
ployees of Volkswagen AG since 1 July 2012. Since the on-
line learning programmes on compliance were set up, 
more than 70,000 employees have already taken part, 
benefiting from this opportunity for continuing profes-
sional development (> p. 43). 
Communication of compliance activities
Compliance issues are communicated to employees not 
only through traditional communication channels (em-
ployee magazines of the brands, companies and loca-
tions), but also via electronic media such as intranet por-
tals, apps, blogs, audio-podcasts and online newsletters. 
The spectrum is rounded off by information stands at 
works meetings and other employee meetings.
Compliance communication activities at Volkswagen meet 
with positive responses both in-house and externally. In 
the course of the reporting year, several of the Group’s 
cross-media communications campaigns and media won 
awards. A consistent and appealing campaign based on a 
series of films made by Volkswagen on the topic of compli-
ance using a prominent actor to convey the message har-
vested to a strong and positive echo. In the three days that 
Members of the compliance team regularly train different target 
groups on compliance issues.

followed a works meeting at which a compliance film in-
cluding statements from the Board of Management was 
shown, the compliance site on the Volkswagen portal was 
called up over 17,000 times.
The compliance site on the internal Volkswagen portal 
contains a wide range of information for employees. 
Among other things, visitors to the site can call up all the 
guidelines and internal publications on the topic. Also 
available are the key messages from the Chairman of the 
Board of Management. In 2012, this online offering, 
which is also available in English, was called up some 
90,000 times. Further intensive communications support 
for compliance activities is planned for 2013. 
Lobbying
Automobile manufacturers operate in a highly complex 
and tightly regulated environment. It is both necessary 
and legitimate for a company like Volkswagen, which 
bears responsibility for prosperity and employment in 
many countries around the world, to be actively involved 
in creating the framework for business activities. In this 
context, the aim and role of the Group function ‘External 
Relations and Government Relations’ is to widen the 
Company’s scope for action. 
Within the Company, ‘External Relations’ promotes a cul-
ture of openness and dialogue and helps to facilitate com-
munication with the world of policy-making and other 
business sectors. This Division operates like an early 
warning system, identifying and gathering information, 
analysing its policy and technical relevance, and formu-
lating differentiated strategies for the Group’s Board of 
Management. It also supports the managers responsible 
for lobbying by making its contacts and knowledge of poli-
cy-making processes available to them.
The Group’s ‘External Relations’ function is an intermedi-
ary between the Company and policy-makers, including 
governments, parliaments and administrative agencies 
but also political parties and associations, non-govern-
mental organisations, and other sectors of industry. It en-
sures that the Company’s views and expertise are brought 
into the legislative and administrative decision-making 
process by openly providing comprehensive information 
and reliable, competent advice based on credibility and 
professionalism.
In line with the Group’s commitment to social responsi-
bility, ‘External Relations’ also provides input into sus-
tainable policy-making in the areas of industrial, trans-
port, environmental and social policy and appropriate 
focusing of public investment strategies. This confident 
dialogue with stakeholders in society helps to enhance the 
Company’s profile, boost its reputation, forge new alli-
ances, and build on existing goodwill. The aim is to create 
and maintain stable relationships with all key Company 
stakeholders.

Infringements
In keeping with the Company’s holistic compliance man-
agement system, the ‘Compliance’ function is closely coor-
dinated with other functions within the Group. ‘Group In-
ternal Audit’ and ‘Group Security’ lead on investigative 
work, while ‘Human Resources’ and ‘Legal Affairs’ adopt a 
reactive approach that complements the Group’s proactive, 
preventive approach to compliance.
The Group has had an ombudsman system since 2006, 
which can be used to notify actual or suspected infringe-
ments – in particular in relation to corruption – to the 
Group’s two independent ombudsmen, Frankfurt-based 
lawyers Dr. Rainer Buchert and Thomas Rohrbach. In 
2012, the two independent ombudsmen forwarded 46  
notifications to the Anti-Corruption Officer of the Volks-
wagen Group while preserving the anonymity of the origi-
nal notifier. A further 64 notifications were made direct to 
the Anti-Corruption Officer or to the Head of Group Internal 
Audit. Each one of these notifications was investigated.
Action was taken against 24 employees in 2012 following in-
vestigations prompted by notifications. In 13 of these cases, 
the employee’s contract was terminated. Any breach of the 
law or of internal guidelines attracts an appropriate sanc-
tion, up to and including dismissal. Moreover, during the 
reporting year, a small number of contracts with business 
partners were terminated or not renewed because of in-
fringements related to corruption.

External scrutiny
During the reporting year, the Company commissioned a 
university to audit Volkswagen AG’s compliance manage-
ment systems. One of the auditors was a senior academic 
who holds a chair in criminal law and criminology and is 
therefore a recognised expert in this area. The auditors 
concluded that Volkswagen has “an effective and efficient 
compliance management system.”
Outlook: the compliance programme in 2013
On the basis of the Group’s risk analysis, the focus of 
compliance activities in 2013 will be on strengthening ex-
isting structures, on expanding the compliance organisa-
tion within the Volkswagen Group, and on anti-corruption 
measures in China.
RIsK MANAGEMENt 
The Group’s risk management system (RMS) is designed 
to identify potential risks at an early stage so that suitable 
checks and countermeasures can be initiated to avert the 
threat of loss to the Company, and so that any risks that 
might jeopardise its continued existence can be ruled 
out. In this context, risk is used to denote the danger of 
failing to achieve a corporate or divisional target.  
 49
Transparent and appropriate risk management is based 
on uniform principles for the entire Group. These in-
clude:
> Fostering an open risk culture,
> Gearing risk management to corporate objectives,
> Compliance (> p. 42),
> Ensuring that risk management is appropriate to the na-
ture, extent, complexity and risk content of the specific 
business activity and business environment, and 
> Regularly monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of 
risk management.

From an organisational point of view, the design of the risk 
management system at Volkswagen AG is based on the in-
ternationally recognised COSO enterprise risk manage-
ment framework. In this connection, Volkswagen AG has 
adopted a unified and integrated governance, risk & com-
pliance (GRC) approach: this integrates risk management 
system, internal audit system and compliance manage-
ment system aspects into a unified management approach. 
One advantage of this is that it permits efficient addressing 
of compliance-relevant issues in a single risk management 
process and enables the resulting findings to be used for 
the benefit of the Group’s compliance programme.
The risk management system is an integral part of the  
Volkswagen Group’s structure and workflows, and is em-
bedded in its day-to-day business processes. It follows the 
“three lines of defence” approach.
Implementing and ensuring the effectiveness of the RMS 
at operational level (“first level”) is a fundamental task of 
the divisions and companies. Interim risk management 
reports from the business units provide the Board of 
Management with an up-to-date picture of the Group’s 
current risk situation at all times. Events that entail a risk 
are identified and assessed on a decentralised basis in 
the divisions and at the investees. Countermeasures are 
introduced immediately, and assessment of their effects 
is followed by timely incorporation of the information 
into the planning process. The results of the risk manage-
ment process are used to provide ongoing support for 
budget planning and controlling. Targets agreed in the 
budget planning rounds are continually verified in revolv-
ing planning reviews. At the same time, the results of risk 
mitigation measures that have already been taken are 
speedily incorporated into the monthly business develop-
ment forecasts. This means that the Board of Manage-
ment always has access to an overall picture of the current 
risk situation through the documented reporting chan-
nels. Significant risks are set out in the Annual Report. 
Volkswagen is prepared to enter into transparent risks 
that are commensurate with the benefits expected from 
the business.

inquiries about the risk situation and RMS effectiveness 
to the GRC officers in the individual functional areas and 
to all major investees worldwide. In the light of the feed-
back about several thousand risks, the department then 
updates the overall picture of the potential risk situation 
and assesses the effectiveness of the RMS as a whole.
For every significant risk identified, GRC determines the 
expected probability of occurrence and the expected scale 
of the loss, and documents the risk management and con-
trol measures taken at management level. Risks arising 
from potential infringements of rules (compliance risks) 
are integrated in this process, as are strategic, operating 
and reporting risks. The effectiveness of important risk 
management and control measures is tested, and any def-
icits identified are reported and remedied.
The Group’s Internal Audit Department (“third level”) 
helps the Board of Management to monitor the various 
functional areas and business units within the Group. The 
risk early warning system and the structure and imple-
mentation of the risk management system are regularly 
checked by the Internal Audit Department in the course of 
its independent audit activities, and also by the Group’s ex-
ternal auditors.

LOCALIsAtION
Localisation is a central element of corporate responsi-
bility, because through localisation a company ensures 
that its value creation takes place at its individual plants 
and in their business environment. Suppliers relocate 
to the area and new jobs are created locally. As a result, 
Volkswagen’s commitment to the concept of localisa-
tion allows it to offer people around the world the 
chance to participate in economic prosperity.
Localisation also has economic benefits for Volkswagen, 
reducing the Company’s logistics costs and, on the pur-
chasing front, ensuring prices in line with local market 
conditions – with no additional costs for transport or cus-
toms duties. Currency risks are also reduced. Localisation 
therefore represents a win-win situation, with economic, 
ecological and social advantages for both Volkswagen and 
the regions in which the Company’s plants are located.
A current example is the Volkswagen brand’s new gearbox 
factory in Tianjin, China, where 1,500 new jobs will be 
created and modern educational institutions put in place. 
Plus, Volkswagen will be working with the best local tech-
nical colleges to build a machining centre of excellence in 
Tianjin where teachers can be trained to cover the medi-
um-term demand for technically qualified experts in par-
ticular fields. 
Volkswagen witnessed a similar positive development in 
Pune, India. Since the Company set up its production 
plant there, 67 new supplier operations have sprung up in 
Pune, creating some 13,000 new indirect jobs. Also, at the 
Chattanooga plant in the USA, 17 new supplier facilities 
have created 1,700 new jobs in the vicinity of the new  
Volkswagen factory. In the long term, Volkswagen will be 
able to provide work here for 10,000 people.
In 2012 Volkswagen concluded agreements covering con-
struction of a new engine plant in Kaluga, Russia. Produc-
tion of the new EA211 generation of engines at the plant is 
scheduled to reach 150,000 units in 2015, creating sub-
stantial value at local level. That means the promise of not 
only new jobs but also a healthy economic upturn for the 
region. Added to which, the new plant allows the Group to 
meet the targets agreed with the Russian government un-
der the terms of Decree 166. This stipulates that at least 30 
percent of the vehicles produced in Russia should be fit-
ted with locally built engines. 
In the period up to 2018 Volkswagen is planning to invest 
around €1 billion in Russia in the ongoing localisation of 
production, the new engine plant at Kaluga and the devel-
opment of new products geared to local market require-
ments. The sourcing process for the Volkswagen Jetta and 
ŠKODA Yeti, Octavia and Rapid projects in 2012 saw the 
number of active suppliers in the country rise from 39 to 
58. The majority of orders were placed with new suppli-
ers, which meant a large number of new jobs were creat-
ed in the regions where these firms are located. 
Volkswagen has fuelled a particularly strong economic 
upturn in the Nizhniy Novgorod region, where the 
Volkswagen Jetta and ŠKODA Yeti and Octavia are pro-
duced by Volkswagen’s local contract manufacturer, GAZ 
Group. 2,200 people are employed by GAZ Group to this 
end in Nizhniy Novgorod alone.  
 50
Confirmation that Volkswagen is also adopting the con-
cept of localisation in Germany can be found at Volks-
wagen Osnabrück. The purchase of the company in 2009 
following the insolvency of Wilhelm Karmann GmbH pro-
vided a shot in the arm for growth in the region. The start 
of series production of the Porsche Boxster in 2012 has 
since seen the plant establish itself as a centre of excel-
lence for cabriolet and small-series models. Instead of 
concentrating solely on the assembly of finished parts, 
the plant actually produces the rear module and side sec-
tions of the car, increasing local value creation. That, in 
turn, safeguards the jobs of the around 1,800 employees 
at the plant and opens up new prospects for the region as 
a whole. 
Volkswagen is also focusing on regional development at 
Group headquarters in Wolfsburg, as the example of 
Wolfsburg AG shows. This joint venture between the city 
of Wolfsburg and Volkswagen AG has been a boon to the 
long-term economic and employment outlook of the local 
area. To this end, business and scientific activities in the 
fields of mobility, leisure and tourism, health manage-
ment, energy and environment, and education have been

networked. A whole array of projects bears witness to the 
vitality of this public-private partnership. 
How just the decision to build a new facility can give an en-
tire region a boost, is illustrated by the start of planning for 
a new Audi plant in San José Chiapa, in the Mexican state 
of Puebla, in 2012. In addition to the allocation of the build-
ing plot, the focus is currently on the infrastructure devel-

authorities are expanding the arterial road and rail net-
works near the plant and connecting the town to two mo-
torways. There are also plans to establish key utilities and 
educational institutions. A new training centre has been 
included in one of the first stages of construction, with the 
aim of commencing training for future Audi employees at 
an early stage.

Uniting numerous brands and companies with all their in-
dividual characteristics and strategic focuses is a demand-
ing task. Demanding not least because we are keen to en-
sure that, within the Volkswagen Group, they all retain 
their own identities. That is the key to enabling all the 
brands and companies to act as important pillars for the 
Group as a whole by playing their part in the shared value 
creation process. With this in mind, in the reporting year 
all the regions and brands made an important contribution 
to the positive overall performance of the Group.

EMPLOYMENt
The Volkswagen Group’s Strategy 2018 sets out how it in-
tends to achieve its goal of becoming the car industry’s 
global market leader in terms of unit sales and topping 
the rankings for customer satisfaction and profitability. 
On top of that, Volkswagen also wants to be the most at-
tractive employer in the automotive sector by 2018. The 
Group’s business strategy is a multidimensional stake-
holder strategy that balances the interests of customers, 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Volks-
wagen has continued to record sound growth in 2012 and 
is now more global and more complex than at any time in 
its history. As the Volkswagen Group grows, so does its re-
sponsibility – for customers and society, for products and 
the environment, for every employee, and for the entire 
Company. However, it can only meet present and future 
challenges if its employees – from apprentices to top 
managers – consistently turn in an outstanding perfor-
mance to ensure that innovation and product quality re-
main at the very highest level in the long term.
Securing outstanding performance, generating success 
and giving employees a share in the profits are central to 
Volkswagen’s HR strategy. Securing the outstanding per-
formance required to assure Volkswagen of pole position 
in the international automobile industry means having a 
top team, an HR principle that applies across the Group’s 
global operations. Including the Chinese joint ventures, 
the Volkswagen Group employed a total of 549,763 people 
on December 31, 2012 – 9.5 percent more than one year 
earlier (501,956 employees). 
In 2011, Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, 
AUDI AG and Volkswagen Financial Services AG alone put 
a total of 3,301 temporary external personnel on perma-
nent contracts. During 2012, they made a further 1,591 
temporary external personnel permanent.
Volkswagen fulfils its responsibility for its employees with 
personnel management that promotes the health, skills 
and dedication of every individual. Ensuring that all em-
ployees can develop their full potential and use their tal-
ents in a manner that creates value means responsible 
leadership, individual HR development, and training.
vocational education and training at volkswagen
Volkswagen sets great store by being a learning and teach-
ing organisation to ensure that outstanding skill levels 
are maintained despite growth. Vocational education and 
training is crucial to developing a top team at Volkswagen. 
In recent years, the Company has strengthened its com-
mitment to the German dual model of vocational training 
and brought further sites into its vocational training sys-
tem. In December 2012, the number of employees in voca-
tional education and training with the Group totalled 
16,714 worldwide, including 11,913 in Germany.
On December 31, 2012, Volkswagen AG was training 4,838 
apprentices and students in 32 professions and 26 courses 
at its six German sites (Wolfsburg, Hanover, Braunschweig, 
Kassel, Emden and Salzgitter). There were 125 more train-
ing places than in 2011, with a further 50 places created at 
Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, Automobilmanufaktur Dres-
den GmbH, and Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH.
AUDI AG employed a total of 2,459 apprentices at the end of

fessions and 259 in commercial professions. MAN and Por-
sche in Germany employed a further 2,212 and 453 appren-
tices respectively at year-end. 
The German dual model of vocational education and 
training has now been adopted at many sites outside Ger-
many, while others are developing the system. For exam-
ple, Volkswagen Group Rus’s Kaluga plant put its third co-
hort into this training system in 2012. The Company added 
the role of specialist for warehouse logistics to its existing 
training professions (motor vehicle mechatronic techni-
cian, construction and production mechanic, automotive 
painter and general mechatronic technician).
At Volkswagen in Chattanooga, USA, the third cohort of  
apprentices embarked on training as motor vehicle me-
chatronic technicians in 2012 in a programme run jointly 
with local partners, the Tennessee Technology Center and 
the Chattanooga State Community College.
In April 2012, meanwhile, Volkswagen Navarra in Pamplo-
na opened a modern training centre with classrooms and 
a workshop offering personal learning areas for appren-
tices in industrial or technical professions. In 2012, 18 ap-
prentices began their vocational education and training 
here, following Germany’s dual model of vocational train-
ing. An agreement with the German Chamber of Foreign 
Trade in Spain means that apprentices who successfully 
complete the training programme can obtain a German 
vocational qualification. Building this training centre and 
Volkswagen’s commitment to training are recognised in 
this part of Spain as a major contribution by the Company 
to social responsibility.
Every year, the Group Board of Management and the Group 
Global Works Council present the “Best Apprentice Award” 
to the top apprentices worldwide. The twelfth awards cere-
mony was held in Munich in late November 2012, and 29 
former apprentices from 13 countries received awards. The 
2012 ceremony saw MAN represented for the first time by 
its two top former apprentices.
Volkswagen is also nurturing particularly talented voca-
tional trainees in talent groups for young specialists. 
These groups are an invaluable tool to support technical-
ly and intellectually gifted employees as they make the 
transition from vocational education and training to pro-
fessional work. Talent groups have been in place at all 
Volkswagen AG sites and at Volkswagen Financial Servic-
es AG since late 2010. In December 2012, 232 talented 
young employees were taking part in this two-year devel-
opment and skills training programme, and 163 have so 
far completed it.
The focus of Volkswagen’s vocational education and train-
ing is to develop technical skills, but apprentices also ben-

efit from a wide range of additional training programmes 
and events. In Germany, these include cooperation be-
tween Volkswagen’s vocational and educational training 
division and “Jugend gründet”, a nationwide online busi-
ness/high-tech competition offering a prize for the best 
product or business idea. The Company also organises 
the “ProTalent” and “ProMechaniker” competitions. In 
cooperation with Porsche Inter Auto GmbH & Co. KG in 
Salzburg and Volkswagen Slovakia a. s. in Bratislava, 
Volkswagen AG apprentices can now build on their exist-
ing skills and knowledge and enhance their occupational 
mobility and flexibility by spending time working outside 
Germany. AUDI AG also provides early opportunities for 
its young employees to gain international experience: for 
the past five years, 25 apprentices a year from all areas of 
the Company’s operations – industrial, technical or com-
mercial – have had the chance to develop their intercul-
tural skills at a Group site elsewhere in Europe.  
 52 
For over 20 years, Volkswagen apprentices have been in-
volved in the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum. Volks-
wagen sends at least four groups of apprentices to Ausch-
witz each year to spend two weeks working with young 
Poles at the Memorial and Museum. The groups are briefed 
and supervised by the International Auschwitz Committee 
and our subsidiary, Volkswagen Coaching GmbH. Over 
2,100 young Germans and Poles have so far taken part in 
this programme. Volkswagen AG’s sustainable pedagogical 
and political commitment to the scheme is recognised 
across the world. 
At the General Works Council’s suggestion, Volkswagen 
substantially broadened its involvement in the Memorial 
and the International Youth Meeting Centre in Auschwitz 
in 2008. As a result, four groups of managers, manage-
ment trainees and “Meister” (foremen and group leaders) 
now take part in a four-day seminar there each year, also 
overseen by the International Auschwitz Council. Since 
2012, the opportunity to be involved with the Auschwitz 
Memorial has been extended to apprentices in further 
Volkswagen Group subsidiaries and associated compa-
nies.  
 53
Since 2006, young people at the start of their career have 
also had the opportunity, on completion of their training, 
to take part in the “Wanderjahre” (years abroad) pro-
gramme; the name alludes to the tradition among newly-
qualified craftsmen of travelling the world and gaining 
experience. The programme enables the Volkswagen 
Group to boost its younger employees’ intercultural mo-
bility and experience. A total of 32 Volkswagen Group 
companies in 17 countries are now involved in the pro-
gramme, and from 2013, Volkswagen Group of America 
will take the total to 33. So far, over 320 young employees 
of the Volkswagen Group have taken up this opportunity 
to gain their initial work experience outside their home 
country. In 2012, 46 participants from Germany and 10 
from a further four countries took advantage of the pro-
gramme to spend their ‘year abroad’ in a Volkswagen 
Group company.
Developing graduates
Volkswagen develops young graduates through a scheme 
involving two distinct programmes, the Student Talent 
Bank and the Academic Talent Pool. Volkswagen has been 
using the Student Talent Bank since 1998 to bring on par-
ticularly able students in workplace-related and cross-
functional areas. Some 2,100 students who have demon-
strated outstanding technical and personal abilities during 
their internship at Volkswagen have been included in the 
Student Talent Bank. Volkswagen supports these former 
interns while they complete their studies, for example by 
inviting them to lectures and presentations, seminars, and 
trips to Volkswagen sites. Shortly before they graduate or 
complete their doctorate, talented students are then 
moved into the Academic Talent Pool. This new recruit-
ment tool provides the Company with a way to identify indi-
viduals with potential for graduate-level entry into a spe-
cialised area.
In 2008, Volkswagen launched the StartUp Direct pro-
gramme to give university students a head start in the  
Company. Over a two-year period, participants in the pro-
gramme not only work in their own department and 
familiarise themselves with the Company but also have an 
opportunity to attend supplementary training seminars. 
The programme also includes placements of a few weeks in 
production and sales as well as an optional foreign place-
ment. University graduates with an international focus

may opt for the StartUp Cross programme instead. This 
18-month international programme includes a three-
month international placement. Over 2,000 trainees have 
acquired their initial experience with Volkswagen on one 
of these two programmes since they were launched. In 
2012 alone, Volkswagen AG recruited a total of 681 gradu-
ates, of whom 29 percent were women.
In order to recruit talented employees from outside Ger-
many, meanwhile the Volkswagen Group launched “Start-
Up Europe” in 2012. Aimed at young engineers from 
southern Europe, this is a trainee programme offering 
participants an opportunity to gain international experi-
ence. Initially, the main target group is graduates from 
Spain and Portugal, who complete a placement with the 
Volkswagen Group in their home country and then move 
to Germany for up to 21 months to work in a Group com-
pany there. On completing the two-year programme, they 
may be offered permanent employment. This opportunity 
is proving very attractive: when the scheme was launched, 
more than 3,600 young graduates applied for the 104 plac-
es available.  
 54
The Student Talent Bank, the Academic Talent Pool, the 
StartUp programmes and a range of further, linked meas-
ures make Volkswagen very attractive to young graduates: 
more than 340,000 graduates in engineering, IT and busi-
ness studies from 24 European countries voted the  
Volkswagen Group “Most Attractive Employer” in the auto-
mobile sector in a survey by the Trendence research insti-
tute. In Germany, AUDI AG won its third consecutive double 
victory in the Trendence employer rankings, scooping “Most 
Attractive Employer” nominations from both engineering 
and business studies graduates. In the Czech Republic, 
ŠKODA took third place in the “Most Attractive Employer” 
rankings and topped the table among engineering and IT 
graduates in the “Best Human Resources Advertising”, “Best 
Recruiter” and “Best Careers Fair Presence” categories. In 
the “Great Place to Work” awards, Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG emerged as the top German employer. 
training and developing every employee
Individual HR development includes cultivating employees 
and giving them the opportunity to acquire and enhance 
Innovation underpins success in the automotive sector, so bringing on a new generation of highly skilled employees is vital to securing  
the Company’s future.

new skills. Volkswagen offers every employee this opportu-
nity within “Berufsfamilien” (vocational groups – the sin-
gular form is “Berufsfamilie”). A Berufsfamilie includes all 
employees with related specialist skills who work together 
regardless of their level of experience or development. 
Learning and teaching involve the Company’s own experi-
enced employees offering their expertise within the frame-
work of both tried-and-tested and innovative training for-
mats. This ensures that learning processes are more geared 
to the specific processes and technical skills requirements of 
a particular Berufsfamilie than in conventional training pro-
grammes and enables knowledge to be transferred in the 
most efficient and tailored way.
This joint approach to learning is being steadily developed 
and extended within Volkswagen: more and more divisions 
are setting up Berufsfamilien that have their own Acade-
mies, in which skills development is organised. From the 
beginning, employees acquire practical knowledge of the 
topics relevant to their Berufsfamilie. The creation and de-
velopment of Berufsfamilie Academies means that sites out-
side Germany are increasingly involved in this skills devel-
opment model, for example via the “Procurement Academy”, 
“Quality Assurance Academy” and “Product Academy”.
The “Group IT Academy”, launched in spring 2012, is the 
Group’s first non-brand-specific Berufsfamilie Academy 
and provides shared learning and teaching within the  
information technology Berufsfamilie for employees of  
Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and Volkswagen Financial Ser-
vices.
The Volkswagen Group is currently restructuring its train-
ing activities and launched the “Volkswagen Group Acade-
my” in January 2013. The Academy is the new umbrella 
body incorporating all the Academies within the Group 
and is a joint venture by AutoUni Wolfsburg, Volkswagen 
Coaching GmbH and its subsidiaries. The reorganisation 
creates a skills network spanning initial vocational train-
ing to academic in-service training that exploits synergies 
to ensure high skills levels and quality standards across the 
Group.
In 2012, the Volkswagen Group welcomed more than 500 
new recruits across all its companies in the Human Re-
sources and Sales and Marketing Berufsfamilien alone. 
“Welcome Days” offer participants an opportunity to find 
out more about the Company’s strategic orientation and 
the challenges it faces and to exchange views with the ex-
perts from the relevant Berufsfamilien.  
 55
 
Initial and in-service training of Meister is a particular 
priority for the Volkswagen Group. Meister qualifications 
are currently being adapted to uniform worldwide stand-
ards and rolled out around the world: the basic foreman/
group leader qualification prepares future Meister for 
their leadership role. During the reporting year, a total of 
364 Meister were trained across Volkswagen, 140 of them 
outside Germany.
Volkswagen prepares its future supervisors for their lead-
ership role by means of Basic Leadership Qualification 
training, followed by an examination. Both elements are 
being rolled out across all Group companies.
Employees’ development for management roles is sup-
ported by the management selection process: in a com-
parative discussion with the relevant specialist depart-
ment, candidates are selected on the basis of their 
technical competencies, while their entrepreneurial 
skills are assessed in a Company-wide Management As-
sessment Center. This system enables the specialised 
departments to take a high level of responsibility for se-
lecting their own management trainees within a Compa-
ny-wide selection process. In 2012, the Management As-
sessment Center was successfully rolled out in India, 
Russia, China and the USA.
Managers and management trainees receive systematic 
skills training in relevant areas, including business admin-
istration and leadership, technology, the environment and 
the globalisation and strategy of the Volkswagen Group.
The Group also has a broad range of tailored skills devel-
opment opportunities for other professions. Volkswagen 
Coaching GmbH is Volkswagen AG’s central in-service 
training provider and offers employees a wide range of 
training measures, including HR development pro-
grammes, crossfunctional seminars and courses, as well 
as specialised training programmes geared to the spe-

cific requirements of individual Berufsfamilien. This 
ensures that each employee is able to develop his or her 
skills on an individual and tailored basis. The systematic 
development of the workforce is also promoted in rela-
tion to the goals set by the Company and its specialised 
departments.
During 2012, more than 110,620 participants benefited 
from in-service training in 9,193 seminars organised by 
Volkswagen Coaching GmbH, a total of 269,128 partici-
pant-days. In the area of specialist skills development 
(e.g. factory automation, robotics and applications engi-
neering or management), 70,382 participants attended 
7,027 seminars over 162,869 participant-days. Mean-
while, in the field of “crossfunctional skills development” 
(which includes leadership skills and personal develop-
ment), 40,242 participants attended 2,166 training cours-
es, representing 106,259 participant-days. 324 new pro-
grammes and courses were developed over the course of 
the reporting year to ensure that the Company’s in-ser-
vice training provision continues to meet its needs.
In-service academic training: the AutoUni
The AutoUni ensures that the Group has access to special-
ist knowledge and research expertise. It works in con-
junction with individual departments within the Group 
and partner universities to offer in-service training tai-
lored to the needs of the Berufsfamilien. The AutoUni 
comprises eight institutes, which between them offer a 
wide range of lectures, conferences, seminars and coop-
erative study modules at university level. These coopera-
tive study modules cover technical subjects in detail, and 
participants take a final examination at the end of each 
module. Over the past few years, the work of the AutoUni, 
which is based in Wolfsburg, has been extended around 
the world, and in 2012, over 15,000 individuals took part 
in 273 AutoUni courses. Around a quarter of all courses 
took place outside the Company’s Wolfsburg headquar-
ters. As part of Volkswagen’s regional outreach, about 40 
percent of the events were open to the general public. In 
2012, there was a particular emphasis on future trends in 
mobility, with work focusing on innovative drive systems 
and the comfort, accessibility and sustainability of trans-
port systems.
The Automotive Research Centre Niedersachsen (NFF) 
focuses on the key future areas for automotive research. 
The NFF was set up in 2007 as an interdisciplinary re-
search centre with the support of the federal state gov-
ernment of Lower Saxony and Volkswagen AG, and 
brings together research activities around the issues of 
vehicles and mobility. It also created a platform for col-
laboration between industry and higher education: cut-

ting-edge research and discoveries feed directly into  
AutoUni courses, especially in the areas of electric trac-
tion and vehicle engineering. In addition to the existing  
AutoUni site on the MobileLife Campus in Wolfsburg, a 
new site is currently being developed at Braunschweig’s 
Research Airport.
Over and above this, the AutoUni is intensively involved in 
the Group’s doctoral student programme, in which over 
440 doctoral students were supervised in 2012 by the vari-
ous companies within the Volkswagen Group in Germany. 
The doctoral students undertake research into ambitious 
PhD thesis topics with relevance for the Company. To this 
end they work closely with their own department in the 
Group, which also appoints a supervisor from within the 
Company. Completed theses may be published as part of 
the AutoUni’s publication series.
Current and past Volkswagen doctoral students meet reg-
ularly under the auspices of the doctoral programme for 
colloquia and presentations as well as for sports and oth-
er events. These activities are managed and run by the 
doctoral students themselves.
Promoting performance and sharing profits
The Volkswagen Group sees in-service training and skills 
development as a key part of building a top team. The sys-
tematic fostering and recognition of good performance is 
another vital element in our strategy, along with rede-
signing our pay systems to ensure that employees have a 
sustainable share in the success and profits of the Com-
pany. Since 2010, Volkswagen AG has had detailed stand-
ard criteria for skills development and performance as-
sessment. These criteria cover the entire workforce, from 
apprentices to top managers, and are underpinned by 
concrete incentive systems within the pay structure. The 
pay system for Volkswagen AG employees covered by col-
lective agreement comprises three main components:
> Basic pay in the form of each employee’s monthly salary.
> An entitlement to profit-sharing, which is laid down by 
collective agreement.
> A performance-related component in operation since 
early 2011, which represents an additional reward for in-
dividual performance.
Payment is job-related and based on the work systems and 
activity descriptions laid down by collective agreement. 
Men and women enjoy equal pay.
As part of the introduction of a performance-related pay 
component, Volkswagen AG and its unions have agreed 
that each employee should have an individual annual ap-
praisal with their line manager. This appraisal has two 
elements: performance assessment and development 
planning. Each employee is given feedback on his or her 
performance and clear guidance on career prospects. 
Recognising and valuing good performance is just as im-
portant in this context as individual potential or any spe-
cific further training needs. 
The number of appraisals has continued to rise since the 
appraisal system was introduced in 2011. Volkswagen AG 
supervisors showed enormous commitment in carrying 
out 83,895 appraisals in 2012, with a further 4,358 apprais-
als using the same criteria carried out within Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Immobilien Service 
GmbH. In 2012, over 88,000 employees received an indi-
vidualised performance-related pay component with their 
salary.
Individual appraisal was also introduced for all manage-
ment staff in 2010. As well as performance assessment and 
development planning, these appraisals include target-
setting and assessment of target achievement. In 2012, 
more than 80 Volkswagen Group companies carried out 
management appraisals, with 3,062 individual appraisals 
conducted at Volkswagen AG alone.
From 2013, all temporary external personnel employed at 
Volkswagen AG will also benefit from the principle of a per-
formance-related pay component. Temporary external 
personnel will be entitled to a performance-related pay 
component from their second year with Volkswagen on-
wards. The process by which this is determined will be sim-
ilar to the individual annual appraisal process at Volks-
wagen AG.
At the beginning of 2010, the Company and the German 
metalworkers’ union IG Metall agreed that the collective 
agreement on sustainable site retention and employment

protection would remain in force until at least the end of 
2014, giving all Volkswagen AG employees employment se-
curity until that date. The Innovation Funds set up at the 
initiative of the General Works Council, and governed by 
the same collective agreement, represent a major contri-
bution to safeguarding employment. Since 2007, Innova-
tion Fund I has helped to further develop existing skills 
areas at the various Volkswagen sites. Innovation Fund II, 
by contrast, began operating in 2011 and was set up to de-
velop new areas of business closely related to the automo-
tive value production chain. The fund’s major emphasis is 
on sustainability, with a view to long-term employment 
protection and creation. Its funding is focused on promis-
ing projects, such as the recycling of testing equipment or 
the use of gravity-based conveyor systems.
To ensure competitiveness and safeguard jobs both within 
and outside Germany, the Volkswagen Group sets great store 
by maintaining and increasing flexibility. The creation of 
“working time accounts” in particular is mostly governed by 
collective bargaining. With a wide range of flexibility tools, 
in 2012 the Group again succeeded in reacting flexibly to 
changes in the economic backdrop and, for example, in se-
curing jobs for the core workforce in India and Portugal. 
Until at least the end of 2014, Volkswagen AG is committed 
to not reducing the recruitment of apprentices and, sub-
Since 2011, every Volkswagen AG employee has had an individual annual appraisal with their line manager, which includes performance  
assessment and development planning. 
ject to performance, apprentices will be taken on perma-
nently on completion of their training. The decision is 
based on the model used to assess Volkswagen apprentic-
es and on their performance in the examination run by 
Germany’s chambers of industry and commerce. Former 
apprentices who meet specific performance criteria will 
be given permanent employment with Volkswagen AG. 
Former apprentices who do not meet these criteria will 
initially be offered a two-year fixed-term contract. After 
two years, the performance assessment that forms part of 
their individual annual appraisal constitutes the basis for 
the decision as to whether to take them on permanently. 
The standard criteria for performance assessment create 
clarity and consistency for every employee in his or her 
professional development.
Management employees also earn part of their salary in 
the form of a personal performance bonus, which re-
wards individual performance. The Company bonus ena-
bles management staff to share in the success of their 
own part of the Company. Since 2010, the Long Term In-
centive (LTI) has been available in addition to other bo-
nus components. The LTI is calculated over a four-year 
period, making it a long-term management remunera-
tion tool that reflects the positive and sustainable devel-
opment of the Company. This means that it complies with 
the aims of the 2009 legislation on remuneration of Board

of Management members but is applied more widely, to 
the whole of Volkswagen’s management worldwide. The 
Long Term Incentive is linked directly to the goals set out 
in the Group’s Strategy 2018 and rewards Volkswagen 
management for their contribution to implementing the 
Strategy’s goals of attaining top employer status and lead-
ing the field in terms of customer satisfaction, sales and 
profitability. In this way, it helps ensure that Volkswagen 
management consistently pursues the multidimensional 
and sustainable goals set out in the Company’s stakehold-
er strategy.
The pay system, which now includes a performance-relat-
ed component, has proved effective in enabling employ-
ees to share in Volkswagen AG’s success. It also helps to 
reward individual performance while preserving compet-
itiveness.
The three components of the remuneration system are in-
creasingly being applied across the Group. The principle 
is that compensation and benefits paid or received for a 
normal working week correspond at least to the legally 
valid and guaranteed minimum. Locally adequate pay-
ments help to ensure an appropriate standard of living for 
employees and their families.  
 18
Participation and co-determination
Employee participation and co-determination rights for 
employee representatives are important success factors 
for the Volkswagen Group. Performance and participa-
tion provide the basis for job security and competitive-
ness. In 2012, existing declarations, including the Decla-
ration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen, and agreements such as the Charter on La-
bour Relations were substantially enhanced and expand-
ed at Volkswagen. The Charter on Temporary Work, 
signed in November 2012, represents agreement by the 
Group Board of Management, the European Group Works 
Council and the Group Global Works Council on the prin-
ciples by which temporary work is managed within the 
Volkswagen Group.
COMPANY BENEFIts
Volkswagen AG has a collective accident insurance policy 
that covers all employees against accidents resulting in 
death or invalidity. In exceptional cases of economic 
hardship – for example, as the result of severe long-term 
illness – employees may apply for a short-term, interest-
free loan from the Company.
The Volkswagen Group also offers its employees the 
opportunity to obtain a vehicle from at least one Group 
brand on favourable terms. The terms of this benefit must 
be affordable for the employees and commercially viable 
for the Company. Apprentices at Volkswagen AG, for 
example, enjoy special concessions on the purchase or 
leasing of a vehicle. In 2012, new Group brands including 
MAN were included in the existing scheme. Working in 
cooperation with the sales departments and Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG, companies outside Germany have 
also been included in similar innovative schemes, such as  
a programme for second-hand car leasing at Volkswagen 
Autoeuropa in Portugal.
employees of Group companies around the world saw their 
range of benefits extended. These benefits vary from site  
to site and may include subsidised transport and meals, 
low-cost accommodation, special payments on the birth  
of a child, monthly childcare allowances, and discounts  
on selected leisure activities. A number of sites also offer 
health care benefits or additional pension insurance. For 
example, Volkswagen in Poznań introduced a voluntary 
company pension scheme open to the entire workforce in 
2012, with the full cost of the monthly contributions met 
by the Company.

69
In 2012, at more than 35 sites both in Germany and else-
where, collective bargaining was carried out. In all cases, 
bargaining was underpinned by a proactive information 
and communication process. For example, Volkswagen 
Group Rus concluded its first ever collective agreement. 
At just one new Group site, strike action preceded the 
opening of the plant. Following democratic negotiations, 
the parties reached agreement, bringing the action to an 
end. 
Charter on Labour relations
The International Charter on Labour Relations first came 
into force in autumn 2009. It links increased participa-
tion rights with shared responsibility, requiring a high 
level of skill and responsibility from employees. The 
Charter applies globally and provides for phased rights to 
information, consultation and co-determination for em-
ployee representatives of the brands, companies and sites 
represented on the Group Global Works Council.  
 17
Since then, many sites have begun to bring the Charter 
to life with declarations of intent and outline implemen-
tation arrangements agreed between management and 
employee representatives. In 2012, the plant-level co-de-
termination rights laid down in the Charter were devel-
oped and enhanced, with the first-ever general Company 
meetings and symposia being held in many sites outside 
Germany. In some cases, the work of local employee  
representatives is now being coordinated or developed 
within special committees, ensuring that the participa-
tion rights set out in the Charter are made more effec-
tive.  
 56
Both the Group Global Works Council and the Company it-
self regularly monitor implementation of the Charter on 
Labour Relations in individual Group companies. At the 
twice-yearly meetings of the international co-determina-
tion bodies (the European Group Works Council and the 
Group Global Works Council), representatives from the 
various sites report back with examples of best practice. 
The Charter on Temporary Work, signed in November 2012, represents agreement by the Group Board of Management, the European Group 
Works Council and the Group Global Works Council on the principles by which temporary work is managed within the Volkswagen Group.

Support to help them fulfil this role is offered in the form of 
skills training and information material. For example, 
the Group Global Works Council ran workshops for the 
newly-elected plant union committee at Volkswagen de 
México, focusing on Volkswagen’s co-determination cul-
ture, the work of works councils and trade unions, and 
quality and process optimisation. At the suggestion of the 
Group Global Works Council, the Mexican plant in Puebla 
organised the “Quality Olympics in Production” to raise 
awareness of quality. The initiative proved popular with 
employees, who participated enthusiastically.
To improve the situation of workers, working conditions, 
participation rights and job security in the Group’s Chi-
nese joint ventures, a Liaison and Coordinating Commit-
tee was set up back in 2008, bringing together the Gener-
al Secretary of the Group Global Works Council, the 
Presidents of the trade unions within the Chinese joint 
venture companies, and representatives of Volkswagen. 
This Committee has held an annual conference since 
2009.
In September 2012, the Group Global Works Council 
founded a Commercial Vehicles Committee, bringing to-
gether employee representatives from the Scania, MAN 
and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands. This Com-
mittee supports the integration of commercial vehicle 
brands in the Volkswagen Group and also has extensive 
information and co-determination rights.
Charter on temporary Work
The underlying aim of the Charter on Temporary Work is 
to ensure that temporary external personnel receive ap-
propriate employment and remuneration conditions and 
that temporary work is managed consistently across the 
Volkswagen Group. The main provisions of the Charter re-
late to:
> The reasonable use of temporary work. Temporary 
work is a key flexibility tool.
> Implementation of equal pay and equal treatment. As  
a matter of principle, temporary external personnel 
should receive the standard basic salary for their role. 
Temporary external personnel enjoy parity of employ-
ment conditions with the permanent workforce.
> Skills training provision for temporary external per-
sonnel. Temporary external personnel are entitled to 
benefit from relevant skills training on the same basis 
as permanent employees. 
This Charter offers all temporary external personnel the 
chance to be moved to a permanent contract provided 
they have the necessary skills and the Company has a 
need for those skills. However, temporary work is one way 
in which Volkswagen can manage fluctuations in the 
economy or particular projects, such as constructing 
plants or sections of plants. In such cases, temporary 
work, along with outside recruitment, may be a sensible 
HR strategy for supplementing its core workforce.

Employee opinion survey
The employee opinion survey is a proven and extensively 
used tool to involve employees actively in what is going on 
in the Company. Employee satisfaction is measured each 
year using the Volkswagen Group’s employee opinion sur-
vey, or “Stimmungsbarometer”, which is standardised 
and covers the entire Group workforce. Once the survey is 
complete, the findings are jointly discussed by supervi-
sors and employees, a process that raises complaints and 
problems on the one hand and suggestions for improve-
ments to work processes on the other. Improvements 
agreed upon are then implemented before the next year’s 
survey. The employee opinion survey was conducted for 
the fifth time in 2012. It covered 102 corporate sites and 
companies in 32 countries, and over 342,000 employees 
took part out of a possible total of more than 378,000. The 
reporting year saw employees of Porsche Holding Salz-
burg, Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH and Volkswagen 
Group Japan K. K. take part for the first time. Employee 
interest in the opinion survey has risen steadily over re-
cent years. During the reporting year, a twelfth statement 
was added to the survey in all German sites, seeking em-
ployees’ views on the implementation of corporate strate-
gy.  
 57
Alongside the employee response rate, the key indicator 
generated by the employee opinion survey is the employee 
satisfaction index. This indicator also improved over the 
past year.

the “volkswagen Way”
The “Volkswagen Way” is another tool that relies on the 
commitment of the workforce for its success. It has been 
an integral part of the way Volkswagen operates for five 
years, and its aim is to secure competitiveness and employ-
ment. The core of the “Volkswagen Way” is a process of 
continuous improvement (German abbreviation: KVP) 
which aims permanently to develop productivity and effi-
ciency as well as quality, ergonomics, leadership and team-
work. In the “Volkswagen Way” the Company has estab-
lished a tool that consistently applies high standards to 
solve problems systematically and sustainably in all areas 
and drive improvement. The involvement of every employ-
ee makes it possible continuously to improve jobs, process-
es and structures across the Company.  
 59
In process optimisation, processes are considered in rela-
tion to improvements in customer satisfaction and quality, 
employee satisfaction and commitment, and productivity 
and costs. Particular emphasis is placed on processes that 
straddle a number of areas, making the “Volkswagen Way” 
a key corporate strategy tool. In November 2012, the Wolfs-
burg plant topped the “Lean Transformation” category of 
the Automotive Lean Production Awards, run by the trade 
journal Automobil Produktion and the consultancy firm 
Agamus Consult for its successful implementation of the 
“Volkswagen Way”.   
 60
The employee opinion survey asks employees to indicate their level of agreement with 12 statements. Once the survey is complete, the find-
ings are jointly discussed by supervisors and employees, and improvements agreed upon are implemented before the next year’s survey.
The other brands within the Volkswagen Group have simi-
lar programmes for boosting efficiency. For example, all 
brands across the Group are now using a standardised pro-
duction system. Using the KVP cascade system – a tiered 
approach to change – standardised methods are being 
used to optimise processes and structures both in produc-
tion and non-production areas right across the operation 
and across all sites.
Ideas management
Volkswagen sets great store by enabling its employees to 
come up with ideas and make suggestions for improving 
work organisation and production processes. Employees’ 
suggestions and ideas are considered and assessed cen-
trally in the Volkswagen “Ideenmanagement” unit, which 
is represented at all the German sites. The first suggestion 
scheme at Volkswagen was introduced as early as 1949, and 
employee commitment to improving products and process-
es has since become a key measure of the workforce’s crea-
tivity, expertise and motivation. Volkswagen also offers 
training and skills development to systematically promote 
a culture of ideas within the Company. This makes ideas 
management a vital management and motivational tool 
for line managers across the Company. Over the course of 
the reporting year, there was a steady expansion in the 
networking of Volkswagen sites around the world.

In 2012, Volkswagen employees across the Group submit-
ted a total of 536,532 suggestions for improvements, 12.9 
percent more than in 2011 (475,073). Adopting 380,475 of 
these suggestions over the reporting period helped sub-
stantially to drive up the quality of our products and the 
efficiency of our processes, reducing costs in the Group 
by a total of €358.1 million. Bonuses worth some €34.1 mil-
lion were awarded to staff whose ideas were adopted in 
acknowledgement of their creativity and involvement in 
the life of the Company.  
 61
Ideas management is also recognised outside the Compa-
ny: in 2012, Volkswagen won the “German Ideas Prize” of 
the German Institute of Business Administration (dib) 
and DEKRA, the international technical inspectorate, for 
the best environmental idea. The German Institute for 
Ideas and Innovation Management also named the head 
of tool making for the Volkswagen brand “Best Manager” 
in Germany’s automobile sector and an outstanding pro-
moter of ideas management.
The ideas management process also helps to make work-
ing at Volkswagen both safer and healthier. The challeng-
es of demographic change are given a high priority, with 
special consideration given to suggestions for ergonomic 
improvements. The suggestions adopted are generating 
continuous improvements in occupational health and 
safety, and in 2012, 5,845 suggestions for improvement re-
lated solely to safety at work, of which 2,384 were adopted.
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
In 2012, Volkswagen continued to tackle demographic 
change with a wide range of measures for ergonomic 
improvement; since 2011, this work has formed part of 
the Holistic Ergonomics Strategy, also known by its 
German abbreviation, GES. Ergonomic improvements 
across the entire product development process ensure 
that workplace quality and the stress and strain on em-
ployees caused by production processes are taken into 
account at the vehicle planning and design stages. The 
aim is to draw on research and scientific knowledge to 
combine state-of-the-art ergonomic workplaces with 
innovative working processes. In cooperation with the 
manufacturing plants, integrated approaches to good 
ergonomic workplace design and working processes 
are being developed. Examples of good practice are 
being adopted in other sites.
Switching to the new Golf model has provided an opportu-
nity to work with employees to make sustainable improve-
ments in workplace ergonomics. The holistic approach of 
Volkswagen’s ergonomic strategy is also reflected in fur-
ther improvements in the methodology used to assess 
workplace stress and strain. So in future not only assem-
bly work but also other tasks can be assessed in this way.
At the Volkswagen brand’s “Ergonomics Day”, held in 
Wolfsburg early in 2012, experts reported on the many ini-
tiatives already in place and presented ergonomic innova-
tions from Volkswagen sites around the world. For exam-
ple, the Kassel plant has been holding regular forums on 
the impact of demographic change. The third such fo-
rum, held in October 2012, focused on combating mental 
stress at the workplace, raising awareness of the issues 
and identifying practical approaches to combating inap-
propriate mental stress.
A number of Volkswagen AG plants took an important step 
towards reducing the impact on health of shift work by re-
organising shift patterns. The reorganisation has drawn 
particularly on research findings relating to shift design 
and adapted these to the needs of the automotive indus-
try. Medical experts favour forward-rotating shift patterns 
with frequent changes, because short-cycle patterns fa-
cilitate the body’s transition from one set of working

hours to another: the forward-rotating shift pattern mim-
ics gradually lengthening days and so is more in line with 
human biorhythms than a pattern that mimics shorten-
ing days.
Employee surveys show that the revised shift patterns im-
pose less stress on employees’ health. In Wolfsburg, em-
ployees were surveyed both before and after their shift 
plans were changed, and the findings show that the meas-
ures taken in 2011 to reduce the impact of shift working on 
health and wellbeing had improved respondents’ general 
level of health. The improvement was particularly marked 
in their perceptions of fitness. 
A two-shift pattern is now in operation for some employees, 
particularly those with performance impairment. These 
employees now work an early and a late shift in alternate 
weeks and are no longer required to work night shifts.
Volkswagen AG is particularly committed to helping em-
ployees with reduced capacity or disabilities. People 
with disabilities made up 7.22 percent of the total work-
force of Volkswagen AG in 2012, once again well above 
the statutory quota. 55 percent of all employees with se-
vere disabilities worked in production and 45 percent in 
the non-production sector. 
As part of the German government’s national action plan 
to implement the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Volkswagen in Ger-
many has been focusing on the inclusion of employees 
with disabilities. The aim is not only to create accessible 
workstations, staff canteens, toilets and washrooms, but 
also to make managers aware of the issues and train them 
to provide the best possible support to employees with 
disabilities.
Volkswagen is also helping to boost employment for peo-
ple with severe disabilities outside the Company: during 
the reporting year alone, it placed orders worth more 
than €22 million with workshops employing people with 
disabilities. In addition, over recent decades, Volkswagen 
mobility aids have also helped to give people with disabili-
ties greater independence and autonomy. The Company 
directly supplies a comprehensive range of driving aids 
for its vehicles including rotating and swivel seats, manu-
ally operated accelerator and brake controls, an EDAG 
automatic wheelchair loading device, and the FRANZ 
hands-free driving system.
On the initiative of the German automotive industry’s rep-
resentatives of people with severe disabilities, Volkswagen 
AG, AUDI AG and Porsche AG took part in a research study 
Examples of good practice in ergonomic workplace and work process design are adopted in other sites.

entitled “Ageing Healthily and Appropriately in the Auto-
motive Industry: Career-Long Participation and Inclu-
sion”, known by its German acronym, PINA. This cooper-
ation project, which is funded by Germany’s Federal 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, also involves Darm-
stadt University of Technology and the University of Co-
logne. The partners are developing tools and initiatives to 
maintain the health and working capacity of older em-
ployees.
During the reporting year, the ŠKODA brand was recog-
nised in the “Most Responsible Company in the Czech Re-
public” awards for its Seniority Programme, while the 
European Commission acknowledged its exemplary treat-
ment of older employees, awarding ŠKODA second prize 
in the “Workplaces for People of All Ages” category as part 
of a European project. For many years now, ŠKODA has 
been focusing its “Seniority Programme” on targeted 
health promotion measures for older employees.

Work2Work is a key programme across all our sites and 
creates new job opportunities for employees with perfor-
mance impairment. It focuses on achieving an optimal fit 
between the requirements of the workplace and employ-
ees’ existing potential, enabling them to make a major con-
tribution to creating value despite their performance im-
pairment. Over recent years, some 1,700 employees have 
benefited from the scheme, and around 700 people are 
now employed in Wolfsburg in 92 different fields of activity 
that have been adapted to their specific capacity. One of 
Work2Work’s aims is to reintegrate employees who have 
suffered illness or injury into Volkswagen’s production and 
specialist departments, and since 2005, it has had some 
200 successes to its credit. The Company knows that many 
performance-impaired employees have talents and exper-
tise that can be developed with targeted support. Once 
these skills are identified, it is often possible to move the 
employees concerned to a different, but high-quality, job 
within the Company. Work2Work is based on three princi-
ples – personal responsibility, independent initiative and 
solidarity – and the Company intends to continue and con-
tinuously improve this success story.
The Company is also particularly committed to its perfor-
mance-impaired employees outside Germany. One prime 
example here is the six sheltered workshops that employ 
over 200 people with disabilities at the ŠKODA production 
plants in the Czech Republic. Working closely with OS 
KOVO, the local trade union, ŠKODA continues to use these 
facilities to create new employment prospects for employ-
ees whose health is impaired.
staying fit, healthy and safe
Healthy, capable and competent employees are crucial to 
top performance and to enabling Volkswagen to boost its 
market position and competitiveness. Protecting and pro-
moting good health is therefore not just a social responsibil-
ity and part of Volkswagen’s corporate culture but also vital 
to the Company’s ongoing economic health and viability. 
Health management at Volkswagen is a key part of corporate 
policy and goes well beyond traditional preventive health-
care and health and safety at work. Volkswagen’s long-estab-
lished integrated approach to health management also in-
cludes aspects such as work organisation, ergonomics, 
leadership style, and prospects for each individual. Arrange-
ments are continually being developed and expanded.
To this end, Volkswagen is represented on a number of 
national and international bodies and maintains close 
links and exchanges with the worlds of higher education 
and politics. In May 2012, Volkswagen collaborated with 
Germany’s Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health and DLR, the German Aerospace Center, to host a 
national conference entitled “Health as a Success Factor: 
Health in a Changing Employment Context”. The confer-
ence, held in Wolfsburg, was the eighth such event run 
jointly by the three organisations.  
 63 
The Volkswagen Checkup, a high-quality, comprehensive 
medical examination and advice session available to all 
employees, was introduced in 2010. The Checkup is now 
available across all Volkswagen AG plants and helps main-
tain and improve the health, fitness and performance of all 
employees. Employees across the board value the Check-
up’s high diagnostic quality: more than 42,000 Volkswagen 
Checkups have been carried out so far.
The Audi Checkup has been running since 2006, with 
more than 51,000 Checkups carried out to date, including

some 9,300 follow-up measures. In 2012 alone, over 7,300 
employees took an Audi Checkup.
Following the successful introduction of the Checkup in 
sites in Germany, the Company’s priority in 2012 was 
again to broaden the range of both internal and external 
preventive health measures linked to the scheme. The 
rollout of the Volkswagen Checkup also continued across 
many Group sites abroad. At Volkswagen de México, the 
Checkup was introduced in the Puebla plant during the 
reporting year, and more than 4,000 employees have al-
ready taken up the opportunity for a free health check. 
Other Group companies have been bringing existing 
screening and preventive health programmes into line 
with the Group-wide standards represented by the Check-
up. Across the Volkswagen Group, the integrated ap-
proach to health management also includes healthy eat-
ing campaigns and a wide variety of sports and leisure 
activities, ranging from a Company ‘fitness factory’ at 
Volkswagen in Wolfsburg to corporate running events, 
also open to the public, at Volkswagen Autoeuropa in Por-
tugal.
2012 also saw Volkswagen continue its international com-
mitment to combating infectious diseases, for example 
through measures to combat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. 
At its South African site in Uitenhage, Volkswagen has in-
vested in building a youth centre run by the HIV preven-
tion initiative LoveLife. The centre offers AIDS testing 
and advice, healthy lifestyle information, sports and lei-
sure activities, academic support, and careers advice. 
The commitment of Volkswagen of South Africa (Pty) Ltd. 
is also recognised internationally: in 2012, the Company 
won a Global Business Coalition on Health award for its 
holistic health programme, following on from the 2011 
award for its pioneering work in the area of HIV preven-
tion.  
 64
Assistance and mentoring opportunities for employees 
with mental health or psychosomatic problems and help 
with rehabilitation are being constantly expanded. 
Among other measures, employees with health problems 
have access to psychological support and specific consul-
tation arrangements for psychosomatic diseases. A tai-
lored rehabilitation programme has been developed to 
reintegrate employees after serious and/or long-term ill-
ness, offering early intervention and job-related support. 
Evaluation of the arrangements by medical experts has 
endorsed the contribution this scheme makes to reinte-
grating employees into the working process. Efforts also

continue to improve ergonomics in all workplaces. De-
ploying ergotherapists to production lines means that em-
ployees can access advice and guidance in situ on how to 
do their jobs more ergonomically. Further improvements 
to the workplace management system have made it a tool 
that helps workplace profiles to be reconciled with the de-
ployment options of individual employees, taking health 
and strain factors into account.
To ensure a common standard of health provision across 
the Group, a multi-level audit system was developed in 
2010, comprising self-audit and expert audit. Many sites 
have already successfully completed a self-audit, while 
the expert audit is currently being developed. This system 
helps not only with standardisation but also with knowl-
edge management, quality improvement, and the maxi-
misation of synergies.
As part of management development, supervisors in the 
Company are being made aware of the need to take great-
er account in the way they do their job as managers of the 
links between leadership and employees’ health.
In addition, since early 2012, compulsory skills modules 
on occupational safety have been organised for all future 
supervisors. On the basis of these skills modules, the 
skills training building blocks for future Meister are be-
ing standardised in 2013 and will be made an integral and 
mandatory element in the programme for developing the 
next generation of Meister. Occupational safety officers at 
all German sites have been receiving skills training since 
2009, creating a consistent basis for occupational safety 
at all Volkswagen brand sites in Germany.  
 65, 66
On the basis of the Group’s occupational safety management 
system (KAMS), which was introduced in 2010, all the rele-
vant Group brands and companies have carried out a com-
prehensive analysis of their occupational safety structures 
and processes. The findings are now available across the 
Group via a central database, and examples of good practice 
COMPANY PENsION PLAN
Volkswagen AG, all its brands and all its subsidiaries run 
Company pension schemes to ensure that former employ-
ees have a source of income in retirement. In Germany, 
these are direct pension commitments. At Volkswagen AG, 
the arrangements comprise a basic pension and contribu-
tory pensions I and II. The basic pension and contributory 
pension I are employer-funded, while contributory pension 
II offers employees an opportunity to convert part of their 
pre-tax salary into pension contributions.
Since 2001, payments to Volkswagen AG’s Company pension 
scheme have been invested in the capital markets by the 
scheme, which is administered in trust by the Volkswagen 
Pension Trust e.V. At the end of 2012, 22 other Group 
companies in Germany were also using these arrangements. 
At year-end 2012, the Company’s pension fund had total 
assets of €3,009 million for employees’ retirement and 
disability pensions and lifelong annuity benefits in the 
event of death. employees can also make direct contri-
butions to their own pension provision by converting a 
proportion of their salary into pension contributions.
Volkswagen AG’s Time Asset Bond is a scheme to reduce the 
length of an employee’s working life. Since 1998, the bond 
has offered employees the chance to bring forward their 
retirement age by making contributions from their gross 
salary or their working time credits. Their contributions are 
invested in the capital markets by the Time Asset Fund, 
which is administered in trust by the Volkswagen Pension 
Trust e.V. The Time Assets accumulated can then be used to 
enable employees to take paid time off in the run-up to 
retirement. At the end of the reporting year, the Time Asset 
Fund had assets of €1,329 million.

across the Volkswagen Group are systematically disseminat-
ed. A health and safety committee has been set up at each in-
cluded site to represent the entire local workforce.
Moreover, all those involved have agreed to conduct a 
brand-specific audit at all Volkswagen sites around the 
world from 2012. This audit took place at the first two sites 
in the reporting year. In addition, the Group’s occupa-
tional safety management system at the Osnabrück and 
Uitenhage sites was audited and certified by independent 
auditors. Within the Group, 2012 saw the 27th annual Oc-
cupational Safety Cup competition for Volkswagen plants 
in Europe; the cup for “Best Plant” was awarded to the 
Bratislava plant in June.  
 67
The wide range of occupational safety measures continues 
to help reduce the frequency of accidents and the stress 
they cause. 2012 brought further success in reducing the 
number and severity of occupational accidents.
ADvANCING WOMEN AND  
PROMOtING DIvERsItY
Volkswagen considers both career and family life ex-
tremely important. For Volkswagen, family-friendly HR 
policies are a key factor in becoming a top employer. This 
commitment has a long track record: in 1989, Volks-
wagen was the first major German company to formulate 
guidelines on advancing women, underpinned by tai-
lored programmes. As early as 2007, Volkswagen AG had 
set specific targets for increasing the proportion of wom-
en in the Company. In spring 2011, the Volkswagen Group 
set differentiated targets within the framework of volun-
tary undertakings to achieve sustainable growth in the 
proportion of women working for the Company in Ger-
many. With this differentiated approach, Volkswagen is 
on course to promote equality of opportunity in a way 
that is realistic and makes business sense.
Recruiting and developing talented women
One pioneering measure is setting quotas for graduate re-
cruitment. Volkswagen recruits the best graduates in their 
cohort in the skills area it needs and develops them system-
atically. As its starting point here, Volkswagen takes the 
proportion of female graduates in each discipline, so that, 
for example, around 10 percent of all the mechanical engi-
Volkswagen is keen to attract talented women. The “Woman Experience Day” targets female students and graduates in engineering disciplines. 
Hands-on experience days give young women a practical insight into careers in the automotive industry.

neers it recruits should be women. For electrical engineer-
ing, the proportion is also 10 percent, rising to 50 percent 
in business areas. When all the disciplines relevant to  
Volkswagen’s work are averaged out, differentiated quotas 
produce a recruitment target of at least 30 percent female 
graduates.
Volkswagen forges links with female students early in 
their academic careers to persuade them of the attrac-
tions of the engineering professions with the Company. 
In 2012, Volkswagen began working with universities to 
offer a six-month internship for female students with the 
Abitur, Germany’s school-leaving examination. Known as 
the “Technikum”, this internship is designed to encour-
age young women to take up courses in such areas as me-
chanical engineering, electrical engineering, vehicle 
technology and mechatronics.  
 68 
Since 2004, the Company has been running the “Woman 
DrivING Award”, aimed at the top female engineers from 
these disciplines. The competition is held across Germany 
every two years and is designed to encourage young female 
graduates into employment in technical areas where they 
can contribute to designing and producing the cars of to-
morrow.  
 69 
The “Woman Experience Day”, introduced in 2012, targets 
female students and graduates in engineering disciplines. 
Participants spend a day and a half with Volkswagen and 
are able to talk to experienced female engineers and HR 
experts. The Company has so far run five “Woman Experi-
ence Days”, offering more than 70 young women an in-
sight into the wide variety of career opportunities the 
Company can offer them.  
 70 
Having a higher proportion of skilled women joining the 
Company is helping to secure a steady increase in the pro-
portion of women managers at various levels of manage-
ment over the next few years. The Volkswagen Group in Ger-
many is targeting an increase in the percentage of women at 
all management levels to 30 percent in the long term.
Since 1998, Volkswagen has offered a mentoring pro-
gramme aimed at increasing the proportion of women in 
management positions. Having been through 21 cycles with 
a total of almost 400 participants, this is a recognised de-
velopment programme in the Group. 41 women took part in 
the Volkswagen AG mentoring programme in 2012.
Volkswagen is also aiming to increase the proportion of fe-
male skilled workers and Meister to 10 percent. To help it 
achieve this goal, the Company has for over six years been 
supporting talented female skilled workers with a tailored 
mentoring programme designed to help them to progress 
to Meister grade. In 2012, 31 women within Volkswagen AG 
benefited from this programme. 
Women accounted for 26.8 percent of all apprentices in 
2012 and for 20.9 percent of all apprentices in industrial or 
technical areas. This means that the Volkswagen Group in 
Germany has one of the highest proportions of female ap-
prentices of any automotive company in the country. Volks-
wagen is keen to increase the proportion to nearer 30 per-
cent, however, and is actively seeking to recruit talented 
women. The tools it is using include special information 
days on industrial or technical vocational education and 
training at Volkswagen and hands-on experience days for 
young women. For the past twelve years, the Company has 
taken part in a national initiative, “Girls’ Day”, and during 
the reporting year, it offered around 2,000 female school 
students a practical insight into the careers offered by the 
automotive industry.  
 71 
AUDI AG ran its tenth “Girls’ Day” at its Ingolstadt site in 
April 2012, attracting around 300 female students from 
across the region. Since 2007, the Association of Bavarian 
Business’s training arm, “Bildungswerk der Bayerischen 
Wirtschaft eV”, has joined forces with AUDI AG and Ingol-
stadt University of Applied Sciences to organise a “Female 
Researchers” camp, and in summer 2012, twelve students 
spent a week experiencing first-hand what female engi-
neers do in their day-to-day work. The camp has a solid ac-
ademic footing but also gives the girls a real insight into 
everyday practice.

Combining work and family
The Volkswagen Group’s Strategy 2018 sets the goal of be-
coming the most attractive employer – which also means 
the most family-friendly employer, because the Company

cannot do without dedicated and well-qualified mothers 
and fathers in any area of its activities. 
Volkswagen is working continually to improve employees’ 
opportunities to combine work and family responsibili-
ties, offering substantial flexibility, an extensive range of 
part-time and shift-working arrangements, a return to 
work at the same level after parental leave, and childcare 
provision either within or near the Company. Telework-
ing and new information and communications technolo-
gy are also helping employees to find the solution for 
combining work and family responsibilities that suits 
them best. 
To maintain contact with employees on parental leave and 
to ensure a smooth return to work at the same level, 
Volkswagen offers work options during parental leave, 
get-togethers for employees on parental leave, and semi-
nars. For more than 15 years, the Company has been run-
ning “Family Management and Career” seminars at the 
Wolfsburg plant, while Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
offers similar provision. All employees on parental leave 
are invited in to the Company six months before they are 
due to return to work, to discuss how they want to manage 
their working life and future career and obtain informa-
tion and advice on the range of childcare provision avail-
able. At the same time, the statutory provisions and Com-
pany arrangements for parental leave and returning to 
work are explained to them.
A further step on the way to becoming a family-friendly em-
ployer is the ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provi-
sion. At the Wolfsburg site, employees have been able since 
2010 to call on “Kaleo – SOS Childcare” which provides 
childcare when unforeseen circumstances arise. AUDI AG 
has been offering employees flexible short-term childcare 
since September 2012.
During the reporting year, five Volkswagen AG sites of-
fered provision for childcare during school holidays, ca-
tering for children aged between 6 and 12. From 2013, this 
provision will be rolled out to all Volkswagen AG sites. 
Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH and Porsche AG are also 
planning holiday childcare provision from 2013, following 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG and AUDI AG, which 
have been running such programmes since 2008 and 2011 
respectively.
The Volkswagen Group has so far found it beneficial to es-
tablish childcare facilities within or near the Company. 
For example, Volkswagen Financial Services AG opened 
the “Frech Daxe” nursery in Braunschweig in 2008, 
which has capacity for up to 180 children up to six years of 
age, making it one of Germany’s largest company nurser-
Volkswagen is working continually to improve employees’ opportunities to combine work and family responsibilities. One example here is  
the ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provision.

ies. In 2011, Volkswagen in Kassel and MAN Diesel & Turbo 
SE in Augsburg both opened childcare day centres near 
their premises, while the Volkswagen Group of America 
has been offering childcare provision at its Chattanooga 
plant since January 2012. Working with a regional health 
service provider, it has set up modern facilities offering 
round-the-clock care seven days a week for up to 200 chil-
dren. The care centre is also open to the local community, 
but Volkswagen employees enjoy discounted fees. As well 
as full-day care for babies and children from six weeks to 
five years of age, the centre also offers half-day care for 
schoolchildren aged up to 13. 
Volkswagen Motor Polska in Poland won a prize in the na-
tional “Mothers at Work” competition in 2012 for its com-
mitment to the family, while Volkswagen Motor Polska 
and Volkswagen Poznan’s “Mother-to-be” programme al-
lows women to work flexible hours or to reduce their 
hours without loss of pay during pregnancy. Women also 
benefit from additional arrangements such as rest rooms 
for pregnant and breast-feeding women, dedicated park-
ing spaces near the workplace, and special medical 
check-ups from the Company medical service. Since the 
programme was launched at Volkswagen Motor Polska in 
2006 and at Volkswagen Poznan in 2008, more than 100 
mothers-to-be have benefited from these arrangements.
Volkswagen AG has a wide range of provision for time off to 
help its employees to care for close family members. Em-
ployees have a right to 10 working days’ leave at short notice 
to organise appropriate care or to make other arrange-
ments. They may also take up to six months’ part-time or 
full-time leave to fulfil their caring responsibilities.
Volkswagen is particularly flexible in its commitment to 
re-employing workers who take extended leave. For the 
past 20 years or so, employees have been able to request 
up to eight years’ leave of absence without having to give 
reasons and have the right to re-employment on their for-
mer terms and conditions.
Diversity and Equality
The Volkswagen Group is a complex global undertaking 
with 99 manufacturing plants across Europe, America, 
Asia and Africa. Volkswagen vehicles are sold in 153 coun-
tries, and in 2012, Volkswagen AG alone employed nation-
als of 107 countries. The Company is deeply committed to 
promoting peaceful cooperation between diverse tradi-
tions and cultures. 
Volkswagen is committed to respect, tolerance and cosmo-
politanism. Treating each other with respect and working 
together means valuing each individual’s personality. 
Volkswagen guarantees equal opportunity and equal treat-
ment irrespective of ethnicity, skin colour, gender, disabil-
ity, ideology, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, social 
background or political conviction provided this is based 
on democratic principles and tolerance towards those of 
contradictory convictions. The Volkswagen Group’s Code 
of Conduct underpins this aspiration across the Group, 
and every employee and member of an executive body has 
responsibility under the Code for ensuring that individuals 
work together in partnership.  
 15
 
The fact is, however, that discrimination happens in all 
parts of society. Openness and transparency, collegiality, 
and civil courage have proved the best tools with which to 
combat it, so every employee is under an obligation to noti-
fy any breach of the Code without delay. If an employee 
feels he or she is being discriminated against, the Compa-
ny meets the statutory provisions for whistle-blowing but 
also provides access to trained personnel to support and 
advise the individual concerned. At the employee’s re-
quest, meetings can be organised with all parties to resolve 
the situation, and this system has proved successful in re-
solving many disputes before they ever reached the formal 
complaint stage. If there is a major breach of the Code of 
Conduct, the Company may take appropriate action against 
an individual who is acting in a discriminatory way; sanc-
tions range from a formal warning or relocation to dis-
missal. 
These rights and obligations have been firmly established 
in the works agreement “Co-operative Conduct at the 
Workplace” for Volkswagen AG employees and sites since 
1996. This works agreement was revised in 2007, and every 
new employee receives a copy or instruction when they are 
appointed. To provide deeper insight, Volkswagen also reg-
ularly holds seminars on fair behaviour at the workplace,

seminars for line managers, and briefings on labour law 
for those in an advisory role. There are also plans to intro-
duce an online learning programme to complement the 
Company’s current skills training provision.
sOCIAL REsPONsIBILItY
Corporate social responsibility also means being commit-
ted to local well-being beyond the factory gates – for exam-
ple, through promoting regional growth initiatives. 
Wolfsburg AG, a public-private partnership between the 
Company and the town of Wolfsburg set up in 1999, takes a 
leading role here. Since 2009, it has been partnering with 
another organisation to form the “Allianz für die Region” 
or Regional Alliance; its partner, the “Region Braun- 
schweig GmbH” project, takes in the towns of Wolfsburg, 
Braunschweig and Salzgitter and the surrounding rural 
areas, as well as regional businesses. The aim of the Alli-
ance is to develop this region as a national beacon for em-
ployment and quality of life. To this end, partners from the 
private sector, higher education, government and society 
have joined forces to share skills and resources at local, 
regional and supra-regional level. In addition to a broad 
range of measures to promote business, the initiative also 
contributes towards educational, health, leisure and en-
ergy goals. By improving local facilities for residents and 
businesses, the Alliance is boosting a sense of well-being 
and identity and making the area more attractive to skilled 
workers and as a business location.
Pioneering approaches to sustainable regional develop-
ment have already been launched in many areas. For exam-
ple, what is known as the “Metropolitan Region of Hano-
ver, Braunschweig, Göttingen and Wolfsburg” hosts one of 
Germany’s four electric mobility showcases. Wolfenbüttel, 
an administrative district involved in piloting the “Health 
in the Future Regions” project overseen by the federal state 
of Lower Saxony, has launched a mobile doctor’s surgery to 
provide the best possible healthcare to those living in rural 
areas and housebound patients. Cooperation within the 
Regional Alliance is also being stepped up from 2013.
At the initiative of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg AG is coordi-
nating cooperation between Volkswagen, the Volkswagen 
Works Council, the town of Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg AG, Auto-
stadt GmbH, and public transport providers in Wolfsburg. 
The partners have been working together since early 2012 
to develop coordinated models for sustainable improve-
ment in the traffic conditions around the Wolfsburg site. 
The first results came on stream during the reporting year 
and included a plant shuttle bus service, new parking pro-
vision, and dedicated parking areas for car-sharers.  
 73
In addition to these infrastructure projects, Volkswagen  
is also actively involved in education in the region. The 
“Neue Schule Wolfsburg” project, an initiative designed 
to set up a new school in Wolfsburg in partnership with 
the town and local businesses, opened its doors in August 
2009. The primary and secondary school, which is open 
to all children from the town of Wolfsburg and the sur-
rounding region, designs its curriculum around five key 
themes: a strong international focus, science and tech-
nology, business, the arts, and the promotion of talent. 
The school’s mission was developed by an international 
panel of experts and is delivered by 64 committed teach-
ers who work closely with business and educational ex-
perts and a wide range of extramural institutions. In the 
current (2012/2013) school year, the school has more than 
500 students in years 1 to 4 and 5 to 8 (those aged between 
6 and 9 and between 10 and 13). The steady stream of inter-
ested visitors from German towns and cities and adminis-
trative districts shows that our efforts in this area have 
created new impetus in the education sector.
In addition to school projects, many Group sites have 
launched their own education initiatives in the area of 
road safety. Porsche AG, for example, collaborated with a 
partner to set up a “Kids’ Driving School”. A longer-run-
ning initiative is the “Parque Polo”, an area for road safety 
training through play for children aged 5 to 15 in the 
grounds of the Volkswagen Navarra plant in Spain. The 
park was opened in 1999 as a community project run by 
Volkswagen Navarra, the Navarra savings bank, and the 
regional government. 4,227 school-age children visited 
the park in its first year, and by 2012, visitor numbers had 
almost doubled, to 8,019.  
 74 
ŠKODA, too, is constantly expanding its road safety train-
ing activities. The multimedia tool “Playful ŠKODA” is

aimed primarily at school-age children and helps young 
children to get to grips with the concepts and rules of road 
traffic. This interactive tool can be accessed in four lan-
guages on the ŠKODA website.  
 75
Volkswagen Group China, meanwhile, has been building 
on the success of its road safety television programme 
“Family Road Safety” in 2012 to launch a fifth series, 
which targets the whole family with tips and advice for 
safe travel.
But Volkswagen aims to support the older members of 
society as well as the youngest. The Company’s HR policy 
is to support older workers as they make the transition 
from employment to retirement. About two years before 
they are due to retire, older employees take part in 
events facilitated by HR staff to help them move smooth-
ly into this new phase in their lives. They are briefed on 
volunteering 
opportunities, 
including 
working 
in 
schools to help children with reading or as learning sup-
port assistants. A Group-wide “Senior Expert” scheme 
was established to provide this service across all sites, 
and retired employees are offered the opportunity to 
pass on their skills and experience to others, whether at 
regional, national or international level, for example by 
teaching technology and maths in schools or by helping 
to train specialists and management staff. Since the pro-
ject began in September 2010, some 250 retirees have 
signed up with this scheme.
Volkswagen takes enormous pride in its commitment to 
volunteering. Current employees are also very keen to 
take up and carry out voluntary roles, and the Company 
supports them in their efforts. The “Volkswagen Pro 
Ehrenamt” (Volkswagen Supports Volunteering) initia-
tive is a highly successful clearing house, linking com-
munity initiatives looking for volunteers with Volkswagen 
staff wanting to help in a social capacity. “Volkswagen 
Pro Ehrenamt” works not only within Volkswagen AG 
sites but also in the surrounding regions in partnership 
with some 700 organisations and bodies. The core aim is 
to boost the profile of volunteering in the public percep-
tion, and support for volunteering has become firmly 
embedded in the Group’s sustainability strategy over the 
past few years.
In 2012 alone, line managers held more than 800 debrief-
ings with volunteers that highlighted the value of social 
responsibility and skills development outside narrowly 
defined technical areas. Since the project was set up in 
late 2008, it has registered over 3,000 volunteer openings 
and placed some 1,500 volunteers. Other companies in 
the Group have developed similar models, including 
AUDI AG and ŠKODA Auto a. s.
Volkswagen also supports employees who volunteer as 
fire-fighters by funding, organising and carrying out the 
necessary medical tests on those trained to use breathing 
equipment. Volunteer fire-fighters are able to access 
these preventive tests at all German sites as part of the 
employee preventive healthcare programme. This ena-
bles the Company to reduce the amount of time volun-
teers spend on such procedures and, by meeting the cost, 
also to relieve the financial burden on local communities. 
The scheme, which was launched by “Volkswagen pro 
Ehrenamt”, has been running since 2011. 
The Volkswagen Group also supports the voluntary commit-
ments of its employees outside Germany. The “Great Show of 
Hands” programme that operates in and around Johannes-
burg and Port Elizabeth is just one example. The programme 
was launched at the initiative of Volkswagen employees in 
South Africa who wanted to play an active part in the exten-
sive support offered by the Company to local communities. 
The “Great Show of Hands” programme focuses on educa-
tion, support for young people, healthcare and community 
welfare, and its projects are supported by Volkswagen of 
South Africa (Pty.) Ltd. More than 300 Volkswagen employ-
ees took part in a range of voluntary activities in 2012. 
As well as giving their time and talents, Volkswagen em-
ployees show sustainable commitment to charitable giving. 
For several decades, the Company has operated an employ-
ee donation scheme initiated by the General Works Coun-
cil to benefit those in need in the areas in which it oper-
ates, and employees and Company alike have supported it 
generously. In Wolfsburg alone, about €410,000 was raised 
in 2012 to support social welfare organisations.
The Company also demonstrates its social responsibility 
through its recently-created foundation, the “Volkswagen

Belegschaftsstiftung” (Volkswagen Employees’ Founda-
tion). This body, set up by Volkswagen AG in 2011, supports 
social projects benefiting socially disadvantaged children 
and young people across all Group sites, with a particular 
emphasis on vocational education and training. The 
Board of Management and the Board of Trustees took up 
office in 2011. They have decided, in conjunction with the 
Volkswagen Belegschaftsstiftung’s cooperation partner – 
the children’s and adolescents’ charity “terre des 
Hommes” – to build a vocational education and training 
centre for socially disadvantaged young people in India. 
Training began in mid-2012 and is being provided on al-
ternative premises until the centre is built. 
The Company supports organisations and events world-
wide through sponsoring and donations. Charitable giv-
ing is a key way in which Volkswagen channels its com-
mitment to social responsibility. The Company has a 
Group-wide Code of Conduct governing donations and 
sponsoring and donates both money and equipment for 
science and education, culture, sport and social con-
cerns.  
For example, Volkswagen has for many years collaborated 
with the Peter Maffay Foundation. Set up in 2000, the 
Foundation mainly provides therapeutic activity holidays 
for disadvantaged and traumatised children and young 
people. Volkswagen has been working with singer and 
songwriter Peter Maffay since 2007 in a cooperative “Alli-
ance for Children”, which supports joint charitable pro-
jects for vulnerable and needy children.  
 76
Since 2009, Volkswagen has also been providing vehicle 
support to the Hanover-based “Netzwerk für die Ver-
sorgung schwerkranker Kinder und Jugendlicher e. V.”, a 
network supporting children and young people with seri-
ous health problems. Mobility is vital to the network, and 
in August 2012, Volkswagen donated two vehicles to support 
its research, coordination and training activities across 
Lower Saxony. 
Fairtrade
At the suggestion of the General Works Council, Volks-
wagen has been selling Fairtrade-branded products in 
its catering facilities via its catering provider, Service 
Factory Gastronomie und Hotellerie, since 1999. Fairly 
traded products help producers in developing countries 
to earn an independent and dignified livelihood, and 
support for Fairtrade has been growing across the 
Group: an increasingly wide range of products is availa-
ble, and new sales stands and product information help 
raise awareness and boost sales. In 2012, for example, 
total consumption of Fairtrade coffee was 46.5 tonnes, 
Taking pride in volunteering. The “Great Show of Hands” programme was launched at the initiative of Volkswagen employees in 
South Africa.

close to the record consumption of 51 tonnes in 2011. 
Over the reporting year, Service Factory Office Manage-
ment extended its range of fairly traded products to in-
clude craft items for the first time. Small workshops in 
Madagascar have been using recycled cans to produce 
model vehicles based on the iconic VW Beetle  and VW 
Transporter T2. More than 1,500 models have been sold 
within Volkswagen since they were introduced in May 
2012, enabling two new craft businesses in Madagascar 
to be recruited as suppliers.
Company donations 
Volkswagen supports organisations and events around the 
world with sponsoring and donations in areas including:
> Science and research, education
> Charitable purposes
> Sport
> Culture
> General welfare and other purposes
> Churches, religious bodies and learned bodies
The total value of giving in 2012 does not include the “Volkswagen Bel-
egschaftsstiftung” (Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation). Volkswagen 
made no donations to political parties, party-affiliated foundations or 
representatives of the political arena.
*The figure given does not include cause-related marketing, sponsor-
ing or projects and activities conducted by Volkswagen as part of its 
social and cultural commitment.
Volkswagen only grants donations to organisations recog-
nised to be non-profit or that are authorised by special 
provisions to accept donations. The awarding of dona-
tions must be transparent; the purpose, the recipient of 
the donation, and the receipt for the donation from the 
recipient are documented and can be verified.
For example, in April 2012, Volkswagen and its dealers do-
nated a total of €349,000 to the cooperative “Alliance for 
Children”. The Company has been working with Peter 
Maffay since 2007 to support charitable projects targeting 
children in need. In 2012, Volkswagen donated a total of 
€33 million, more than twice as much as in the previous 
year.
Volkswagen also recognises its corporate responsibility to 
support political parties in their work. The Company is 
very careful to avoid any influence on the exercise of de-
mocracy. Volkswagen does not make donations to politi-
cal parties. 
Workforce donations 
Workforce donations for people in need have a long tradi-
tion at Volkswagen: in 2012, employees of Volkswagen AG 
alone gave more than €2 million to good causes. Work-
force donations represent a major contribution by Volks-
wagen AG companies and their employees to those in 
need in locations where Volkswagen AG operates. In 2012, 
some €490,000 went into supporting regional social pro-
jects, including the “Starthilfe” (Getting Started) project 
devoted to combating the growing problem of child pov-
erty in the Wolfsburg region. “Starthilfe” uses donations 
to launch, promote and focus projects and measures to al-
leviate child poverty. In the “One hour for the future”

campaign, Volkswagen and Audi employees donate an 
hour’s pay to help street children, and in 2012, Volks-
wagen AG employees alone raised over €1.3 million for aid 
projects in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, India 
and Germany. Since 2003, this initiative has also included 
the collection of “spare cents”: employees donate the odd 
 cents included on their monthly pay slip.
To mark the 2010 football World Cup, hosted by South Afri-
ca, the Group Global Works Council launched a special 
project, “A chance to play”, now renamed “A chance to 
play – o direito de brincar” and carried over to the next 
World Cup, which will be held in Brazil. The bodies in-
volved include the “Football and Development Founda-
tion”, which works across South America to coordinate 
the huge interest in street football. Volkswagen AG em-
ployees gave €287,670 to this special project during the 
reporting year.

Volkswagen is motivated by a sense of re-
sponsibility to help meet the key chal-
lenges of the 21st century – in particular 
resource conservation, climate protec-
tion, and striking a fair balance within 
and between generations around the 
world. For a global corporate group like 
Volkswagen, this responsibility grows in 
parallel with its commercial success, at 
the same time boosting the intensity with 
which the Group pursues its Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. 
Volkswagen supported a multitude of ini-
tiatives in 2012 – helping not only with 
concepts and planning, but also by pro-
viding funding and material assets such 
as vehicle loans.  
 78
In selecting projects, the Group is guided 
by a philosophy and fundamental convic-
tion comprising two core elements: conti-
nuity rather than chasing trends; and a 
commitment to sustainable structural 
development in the locations where we 
operate, with the goal of driving socioec-
onomic growth and creating opportuni-
ties for local people. In concrete terms, 
this means that all CSR projects initiated 
or supported by Volkswagen around the 
world comply with the following princi-
ples:
> They align with our corporate mission 
while addressing a specific local or re-
gional issue.
> They are an expression of the diversity 
within the Group and the social envi-
ronment where the projects are car-
ried out.
> They are developed in close dialogue 
with local stakeholders, who are also 
involved in the implementation phase.
> They are managed locally under the re-
sponsibility of the Group units that op-
erate in that region.
This modern understanding of CSR makes 
the projects an important building block 
of sustainability at Volkswagen; the eco-
nomic, environmental and social aspects 
are not conflicting objectives, but are mu-
tually dependent and drive each other for-
ward. At Volkswagen, this approach enjoys 
a long tradition. Long before CSR was in-
corporated as a strategic aspect of its cor-
porate policies, Volkswagen pursued a 
commitment to social responsibility that 
invariably combined the promotion of its 
own business interests with serving phil-
anthropic motives. Projects carried out in 
Brazil and South Africa in the 1970s re-
flect this conviction.
Since 2009, Volkswagen has been hold-
ing regular Group CSR Meetings to build 
effective internal networks between proj-
ects and continue expanding its world-
wide engagement. Wolfsburg played host 
to this Group-wide communication and 
information forum in 2012. At the two-
day conference, CSR coordinators repre-
senting each region and brand presented 
new projects and ideas. 2012 also saw the 
development of a comprehensive CSR 
publication which provides concrete ex-
amples and interesting background in-
formation on individual Volkswagen CSR 
projects.

years, this foundation has reached out to help more than 
a million schoolchildren and students.

MANAGEMENt APPROACH
The Group’s environmental management is responsible 
for ensuring that the ecological aspects of sustainability 
are firmly anchored in our product development and 
production strategy at all sites. For Volkswagen, the pri-
orities here include the efficient handling of resources 
such as energy and water, efficient use of materials, mini-
mising emissions of noise and pollutants, waste and 
wastewater, and preserving and promoting biodiversity. 
Ambitious objectives
Volkswagen has set itself the goal of becoming the global 
number one in the automotive sector in ecological terms by 
2018, and is aiming to improve the eco-friendliness of its 
production by 25 percent. To this end, energy and water 
consumption, together with emissions and waste, are all to 
be cut by 25 percent over 2010 levels. Additionally, in Ger-
many the Group is committed to reducing its greenhouse 
gas emissions from energy supplies by 40 percent between 
2010 and 2020. To meet these ambitious targets, the Group 
will channel over two thirds of its €50.2 billion investment 
programme directly or indirectly into the development of 
increasingly efficient and safer vehicles, new drive systems 
and environmentally compatible production processes at 
its plants around the world.  
 80
Around €600 million worth of investment has been ear-
marked specifically for renewable energy expansion. 
Volkswagen has also set itself clear targets regarding the 
ecological performance of its products. For example, it is 
aiming to reduce the CO2 emissions of its European new 
vehicle fleet by 30 percent by 2015 compared with a 2006 
baseline. Volkswagen has adopted 95 g CO2/km as its 2020 
target for European new car fleet-average emissions.This 
makes the Volkswagen Group the first carmaker to com-
mit to this ambitious goal. This emissions figure corre-
sponds to fuel consumption of less than 4 litres/100 km –
across all vehicle segments and classes.
Volkswagen has already achieved some notable improve-
ments en route to its aspired environmental leadership. 
For example, between 2010 and 2012, emissions of CO2 
from the production process were cut by approximately 
129 kilograms per vehicle produced (passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles), while metallic production 
waste was reduced by more than 28 kilograms per vehicle. 
Over the same period, the Volkswagen Group also re-
duced its output of wastewater per vehicle produced by 
around 440 litres. Between 2008 and 2012, European 
fleet-average CO2 emissions were reduced from 159 g 
CO2/km to 134 g CO2/km. That equates to a reduction of 
approximately 15.7 percent.  
Group-wide environmental management
The corporate environmental management system pro-
vides the organisational basis for meeting the Group’s en-
vironmental targets. It also ensures Group-wide compli-
ance with all relevant legislation. We are not aware of any 
significant violations of environmental legislation during 
the reporting year. 
November 2011 saw the appointment of a Group Chief Of-
ficer for the Environment, Energy and New Business Areas, 
who reports directly to the Board Member for Production 
at Volkswagen AG. This newly created role will combine 
and reinforce all global activities relating to implemen-
tation of the Volkswagen Group environmental manage-
ment and energy strategy, and the development of new

business areas. Important duties will include inter-brand 
coordination on environmental and energy strategies and 
ensuring implementation of these strategies across all 
brands. Within the context of the Collective Agreement 
for the Future, in 2011 an Innovation Fund II was set up at 
the Works Council’s initiative. This fund will promote the 
development of new business areas above and beyond our 
existing portfolio of products and services, with a particu-
lar focus on energy-related and environmental aspects. 
Innovation Fund II will contain around €20 million per 
annum of funding for Volkswagen projects across the en-
tire automotive value chain, and will have the effect of 
safeguarding jobs in the long term. Under one project 
launched with the help of Innovation Fund II, gravity-
based conveyors have been developed which are now han-
dling doors on the Golf 7 production lines in Wolfsburg, 
achieving energy savings of up to 80 percent. The doors 
slide slowly down the roof-mounted conveyors to their 
correct destination on the production line under the  
action of gravity. The same system could also be used to 
handle wheels, bodies, engines and many other types of 
component. Group-wide deployment of this technology 
could potentially create up to 50 jobs.
The Corporate Environmental and Energy Steering 
Group helps to safeguard the long-term value of the Com-
pany and avert potential environmental threats. The 
Steering Group plays an overarching role in the pursuit of 
environmental goals and is subdivided into seven mod-
ules to address measures at each stage of the process 
chain. All decisions made by the Steering Group are di-
rectly incorporated into the Volkswagen Group’s manage-
ment processes. Their implementation falls partly within 
the remit of the plant environmental officers, who meet 
several times a year to discuss projects, goals and meas-
ures. 
In order to ensure that all Volkswagen cars launched on 
the market are environmentally superior to their prede-
cessors, environmental “mentors” are consulted from the 
outset of any vehicle project, and their expertise is incor-
porated into the vehicle development process.

Energy management is also firmly anchored in the Volks- 
wagen organisation. A Corporate Energy Working Group 
was set up back in 2002, with representatives (“Energy Of-
ficers”) from every plant. The Working Group regularly de-
bates a range of issues including energy procurement, 
planning, invoicing and controlling, and develops stand-
ards. It is also in charge of energy reporting, energy audits 
and energy campaigns. The Working Group has drawn up a 
list of around 200 individual energy efficiency measures 
for the technical and organisational sectors. The Working 
Group devises training concepts for energy officers in all 
production segments and at all locations. To date, more 
than 270 energy officers have successfully completed their 
training. 
A corporate energy management system was developed in 
2008. At its heart is a global intranet portal, linking all of-
fices across the Group that are working to boost energy ef-
ficiency. The portal showcases best practice examples and 
facilitates direct contact with those responsible for their 
implementation, to ensure a seamless exchange of ideas. 
It also outlines basic regulations and energy-saving tips, 
including some generated by the central idea manage-
ment system. An interactive program, “The Energy Advis-
er”, provides another invaluable source of information on 
energy efficiency measures in the production sector. 
Principles and certification
Volkswagen boasts a long tradition of environmental man-
agement and certification. In 1995, Volkswagen was the 
first automaker to voluntarily participate in the EU Eco-Au-
dit at its German plants, while its sites worldwide partici-
pated in the environmental certification process to inter-
national standard ISO 14001. The Group Environmental 
Principles governing our products and production opera-
tions are the mainstays of Volkswagen’s environmental 
policy. The Environmental Principles, Product focus on the 
aspects of climate, resources and health, and stipulate that 
over its entire life cycle, every new vehicle model should ex-
hibit superior environmental properties to its predecessor. 
The Environmental Principles, Production are devoted to 
the aspects of production processes and infrastructure. Both 
these sets of Environmental Principles are based on interna-
tional environmental and energy management systems as 
defined by EMAS and ISO 14001. All responsible individuals 
in the corporate functions and at the various sites are re-
quired to uphold the Group Environmental Principles in 
every decision they make. Since 1996, this standard has also 
applied to the environmental management system of the 
Volkswagen Technical Development department, which has 
additionally held DIN ISO/TR 14062 certification since 2009. 
Recertifications and monitoring audits confirmed Volks-
wagen’s leading position during the reporting year.  
 7
training and sensitisation 
The 1995 Factory Agreement on Environmental Protection 
motivates all employees to integrate the principles of envi-
ronmental protection into their everyday work. Volkswagen 
also arranges training courses for employees to ensure that 
environmental management objectives and measures are 
upheld in practice across all its global production sites. In 
2012, a variety of training courses were held, and attended 
by a total of 519 employees. Topics included environmental 
protection for supervisors and energy efficiency awareness 
training for planning staff.  
 24, 25, 81, 82, 83
Additionally, dedicated training is given to environmental 
protection specialists at all Volkswagen locations in Ger-
many, and also (from 2013) at Audi in Neckarsulm. Training 
courses are held at a central location to encourage net-
working and learning from one another. The environmen-
tal protection specialists assist the environmental officers 
and help to anchor environmental protection in the wider 
consciousness of the workforce. Additionally, Works Coun-
cil members at all Volkswagen sites in Germany receive 
training in energy and environmental issues to equip them 
for their vital role as multipliers when recommending spe-
cific practices for greater sustainability. Four such events 
were held in 2012, and attended by a total of 58 participants. 
The Volkswagen brand’s annual “Think Blue. Factory”-Award 
is another important management tool for engaging, in-
centifying and motivating all employees. With effect from 
2013, the Volkswagen “Think Blue. Engineering”-Award will 
also be presented at product level.

and measures are observed at every stage of the supply 
chain (> p. 34). 
Regional and international environmental conferences
Volkswagen holds regular environmental conferences at 
regional and Group levels. The Regional Environmental 
Conferences follow a clear five-point plan, with the open-
ing address followed by international audit workshops, 
after which environmental action plans are drawn up. 
The Regional Conference debates and aligns these plans 
with the corporate objectives, then adopts them if appli-
cable, with due regard for regional feasibility. The aim of 
these Regional Conferences is to synchronise the envi-
ronmental efforts of all plants worldwide, and the next 
one is scheduled for May 2013 in China.  
The 4th Group Environmental Conference was held at the 
AutoUni in Wolfsburg in July 2012, and attended by more 
than 400 experts from sites around the world. Entitled 
“Heading for pole position – both economically and ecologi-
cally”, the Conference brought together the environmental

officers from the plants, planning and products, as well as 
those responsible for implementation in the various de-
partments. On the agenda were environmental require-
ments in the individual regions, powertrains of the future, 
as well as sustainable materials. A “Marketplace of Oppor-
tunities” was set up, showcasing a range of implementation 
strategies, tools and projects. Details of various projects 
and implementation examples can be found in the follow-
ing chapter.

CLIMAtE PROtECtION
With efficient vehicles built using efficient production 
processes, and with its Powertrain and Fuel Strategy as 
a roadmap, Volkswagen is making an important contri-
bution to the fight against climate change (> p. 99). 
The Board of Management embeds climate change and the 
resulting opportunities and risks into its strategic decision-
making processes. It is assisted in this by the CSR & Sus-
tainability Steering Group and the CO₂ Steering Group, 
The Volkswagen Chattanooga Solar Park has a peak output of 9.5 megawatts and is the largest solar facility operated by any  
carmaker in the USA. This eco-friendly power will be used in production of the Passat.

which are made up of sustainability experts and decision-
makers from all the relevant business units. Internally de-
veloped management and analysis tools such as the CO₂ 
Registry are among the information sources used. This tool 
permits analysis of the CO₂ emissions of every vehicle proj-
ect at the Group over the entire product creation process. 
The requirements for CO₂ savings are also laid down in the 
Volkswagen Group Environmental Principles, Product. 
Climate protection is also a component in the process of 
setting employee performance targets at Volkswagen.
Risks related to climate change
Climate change presents significant risks for Volkswagen. 
These risks are therefore an integral focus of the Volkswagen 
Group’s risk management strategy. All risks are quantita-
tively and qualitatively evaluated against eight criteria, and 
assigned a rating. The results of the risk evaluation process 
are reported to the Board of Management, and the process 
itself is reviewed, on an annual basis. This wide-ranging 
evaluation of risks and opportunities is at the heart of  
Volkswagen’s climate protection strategy, which takes into 
account the following factors: 
> regulatory aspects, in particular EU penalties for failing to 
meet fleet-average emissions targets, 
> market-related requirements, resulting in particular from 
increased public awareness of climate issues,
> physical aspects, such as potential supply chain or pro-
duction disruption, for example due to worsening 
droughts or extreme precipitation caused by climate 
change. Water shortages pose a significant risk to Volks-
wagen’s operations, particularly in light of the Compa-
ny’s plans for new production facilities in Asia, Africa 
and Central and South America. The various risk factors 
were taken into account in formulating the Group’s envi-
ronmental goals. 
For the first time ever, the Volkswagen Group has published 
a Scope 3 inventory for CO2 emissions. The calculations re-
vealed that the “use phase” emission category accounts for 
over 70% of all Scope 3 emissions. Against this backdrop, 
Volkswagen offers:
> A product portfolio that makes increased use of fuel-saving, 
low-emission technologies, but with no resulting loss of di-
versity or customer choice. At the present time the Group 
brands offer a total of 245 models with CO₂ emissions of less 
than 120 g CO₂/km, including 36 which already emit less 
than 100 g CO₂/km. 
> Product communication which uses “efficiency badging” 
to highlight extra-efficient, low-CO₂ vehicles and tech-
nologies.  
 87
> Customer information which encourages drivers to 
adopt an efficient, eco-friendly driving style in order to 
reduce CO₂ emissions throughout the life cycle of the 
vehicle.  
 2, 25, 88, 89, 90
Opportunities related to climate change
At the same time, climate change and the associated chang-
es in customer requirements are also opening up new  
opportunities. Volkswagen is developing ever more new 
technologies, products and services whose goal is to offer so-

With the publication of the 2012 Group Sustainability 
Report, the Volkswagen Group has for the first time 
simultaneously published a Scope 3 Inventory for CO₂
emissions. In accordance with the WBSCD/WRI Scope 3 
reporting standards published in 2011, Volkswagen is 
reporting CO₂ emissions in 12 of the 15 Scope 3 categories. 
Calculations showed that more than 90 percent of total 
Scope 3 emissions fell under the categories “Purchased 
goods and services” and “Use of sold products”. The 
information provided in these inventory categories  
was therefore validated and verified in accordance with 
international standard ISO 14064-3 by external auditors 
from the TÜV NORD technical inspectorate. (> p. 143)

lutions to the challenges of climate change. Examples in-
clude efficient, environmentally friendly vehicles, backed up 
by mobility services and fuel-saver courses, as well as ener-
gy-related products for use outside the mobility sector. 
Moreover, climate legislation and statutory targets provide a 
further incentive to develop innovative, efficient technolo-
gies for products and production processes. 
Climate protection in the production sector
Many production plants in all parts of the world, and all 
Group brands, have launched measures to implement the 
Group’s climate protection goals. The Efficient Production 
section of this report presents a number of examples (> p. 111). 
Examples of further projects can be found online.  
 91
Among other things, Volkswagen’s climate goals include a 
commitment to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions as-
sociated with production-related energy supplies. In Ger-
many the aim is to cut these emissions by 40 percent by 
2020 versus 2010 levels. This will only be possible through 
increased use of renewable energy, based on further diver-
sification of the energy-generating mix. In the coming 
years Volkswagen will therefore be investing around €600 
million in the expansion of renewable energies such as so-
lar, wind and hydroelectric power. 
Volkswagen has put in place uniform standards of efficient 
production. In one example of the implementation of these 
standards, in 2012 Volkswagen do Brasil received the first 
ever external certification of its greenhouse gas emissions 
inventory. Certification confirms that the underlying pro-
cess complies with ISO 14064 and the GHG Protocol. Since 
2010, Volkswagen do Brasil has reduced its CO₂ emissions 
per vehicle produced by 4.8 percent, and has increased its 
waste recycling rate to over 95 percent. 
In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group brands imple-
mented a wide range of initiatives and actions at their sites 
to combat climate change. At Scania, for example, climate-
impacting emissions of carbon dioxide from internal goods 
transportation have been reduced by around 70 percent by 
switching from diesel fuel to bioethanol. Scania also par-
ticipated in Earth Hour, switching off the lights for an hour 
at its production facilities in Europe and South America.
Climate protection through efficient products
Volkswagen’s most effective lever in the development of 
more environmentally compatible mobility is its vehicles 
themselves. In 2012, global fleet-average new-car CO₂ 
emissions of the Volkswagen Group stood at 134 g CO₂/km 
– 25 g less than in 2008.
Volkswagen’s long-term approach to emissions reduction will 
focus mainly on powertrain electrification, since electric cars 
are emission-free at the point of use. In the mid-term, by 2015, 
Volkswagen will have reduced the average CO₂ emissions of 
its European new-car fleet by approximately 30 percent 
compared to 2006 levels, bringing its fleet-average emis-

sions down below the 120 g CO₂/km mark for the first time. 
The goal of the development departments is to make each 
new model generation between 10 and 15 percent more ef-
ficient than its predecessor. At the same time it should be 
noted that the Volkswagen Group’s vehicles already offer 
impressive CO₂ performance (> p. 103).

CO₂/km is being introduced in four stages, starting in 2012. 
In 2012, 65 percent compliance was be required, rising to 
100 percent in 2015. A further significant reduction in the 
EU average fleet emissions target, to 95 g CO₂/km by 2020, 
has also already been agreed, although the modalities for 
compliance have still to be determined in an ongoing re-
view by the EU Commission, which is expected to be com-
pleted by mid-2013. Volkswagen has adopted 95 g CO2/km 
as its 2020 target for European new car fleet-average 
emissions. This makes the Volkswagen Group the first 
carmaker to commit to this ambitious goal. 
Other important EU regulations affecting the automotive 
industry include: 
> EU Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and 
energy-efficient road transport vehicles (“Green Pro-
curement” Directive)
> Energy Labelling Directive 1999/94/EC
> Fuel Quality Directive 2009/30/EC, amending fuel quali-
ty specifications and establishing energy efficiency re-
quirements for fuel production 
> Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, establishing 
sustainability criteria 
> Revision of Energy Taxation Directive 2003/96/EC, 
amending minimum tax rates for all energy products 
and electricity.
In order to be optimally prepared for the third emissions 
trading period starting in 2013, Volkswagen calculated 
and reported the CO₂ emissions to be reported for our 
German plants in accordance with the Datenerhebungs-
verordnung (DEV 2020 – German Data Collection Regula-
tion). Volkswagen submitted the appropriate applications 
for the allocation of certificates to the Deutsche Emissions-
handelsstelle (DEHSt – German Emissions Trading Au-
thority) for all the affected plants. The other Volkswagen 
plants in the European Union were also checked in ac-
cordance with the national laws in force at those locations 
and action was taken to ensure that applications were 
submitted to the relevant national authorities in good 
time.  
 93
The changes to the Emissions Trading Directive and their 
transposition into German law have been completed. From 
a current perspective, the number of plants included in the 
European emissions trading system from 2013 onwards 
and the related amount of CO₂ emissions requiring to be 
traded will not increase significantly.
The allocation of the necessary emissions certificates will 
change fundamentally as of 2013. They will no longer be al-
located mostly free of charge through national allocation 
plans. Instead, a steadily falling number of certificates, for 
heat generation using natural gas for example, will be allo-
cated free of charge. Companies will have to purchase any 
additional certificates they require at auction. Unlike be-
fore, CO₂ emissions certificates for power generation will 
have to be purchased in full. Estimates to date indicate that 
the energy costs incurred by the Volkswagen Group’s Euro-
pean sites will increase as a result of purchasing the emis-
sion allowances required for the operation of proprietary 
power plants and heating facilities. The amount of the ad-
ditional costs will depend essentially on the price at which 
the certificates are traded. 
The European Commission is currently giving detailed 
consideration to intervening in EU emissions trading in or-
der to boost it. The Commission is currently in favour of 
withdrawing a defined number of freely allocated certifi-
cates at the beginning of the third trading period and not 
allocating them until the end of the trading period. This ar-
tificial shortage of certificates at the beginning of the trad-
ing period may cause certificate prices to rise.
The future political direction of global climate protection 
agreements remains unclear. There is currently no sound 
long-term prospect of specific reduction targets, respon-
sibilities and funding arrangements or more stringent 
climate protection requirements based on them. At the 
UN, a new climate protection agreement for 2020 on-
wards is to be negotiated by 2015 at the latest.

strategic dialogue 
Continuous dialogue with stakeholders provides Volks-
wagen with a broader basis for assessing the opportuni-
ties and risks of climate change and for developing ap-
propriate strategies and solutions. For many years, 
Volkswagen has been taking part in a dialogue with gov-
ernment representatives, ministries, NGOs, multina-
tional initiatives, other companies, associations and 
public authorities. These stakeholders include the Ger-
man Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Re-
actor Safety’s “National Platform for Electric Mobility”, 
the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United Na-
tions Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD).  
 11
At the annual EUCAR conference in Brussels, Volkswagen 
presented an internal combustion engine developed in 
the framework of the EU research project POWERFUL 
(Powertrain for Future Light-duty vehicles). In combina-
tion with new aftertreatment systems, this engine can 
achieve significant reductions in CO₂ emissions. Along 
with Volkswagen, other vehicle manufacturers, suppliers 
and leading research institutes are also participating in 
this syndicate project. The four-year project is part of the 
seventh EU Commission Research Programme and will 
be concluded in December 2013.
The Volkswagen Group is committed to intensive stake-
holder dialogue at local government level, too. For example 
at its Neckarsulm site, Audi has kept local authorities and 
environmental organisations informed about its progress 
towards carbon-neutral mobility. 
LIFE CYCLE AssEssMENts
To minimise the environmental impacts from its vehi-
cles, Volkswagen looks at the whole life cycle of the vehi-
cle. Using Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), we calculate 
which life cycle processes generate the biggest environ-
mental impacts. The LCA results also highlight improve-
ment potential which can be targeted in future develop-
ment work. 
Focus on lifelong environmental impacts
Using LCAs, Volkswagen analyses the life cycle of new vehi-
cles, components and materials from the first design 
sketches, through the manufacturing and use phases to fi-
nal disposal. After all, a vehicle begins to generate environ-
mental impacts long before it takes to the road. At every 
stage in the life cycle of the vehicle, resources and energy 
are consumed, and emissions are released. The Life Cycle 
Assessment shows that there are marked quantitative vari-
ations in environmental impacts between the different 
phases in the life cycle. For example, whereas CO₂ emis-
sions are relatively high during the use phase, they are vir-
tually negligible in the recycling phase. For water on the 
other hand, the picture is quite different, with relatively 
low consumption and low environmental impacts in the 
use phase and very high impacts further upstream. From 
these findings, Volkswagen can then determine which ac-
tions, targeted in which areas, will be most effective in de-
livering environmentally compatible mobility. 
the four steps of a Life Cycle Assessment
The first stage in the Life Cycle Assessment is the Life Cycle 
Inventory, in which data is collected on every single compo-
nent and process in the life cycle. Volkswagen extracts this 
information from sources such as vehicle parts lists, the 
Volkswagen Material Information System (MISS) and the 
processing-related GABI database. The next step is to calcu-
late how much raw materials and energy each of these com-
ponents and processes consumes over the course of the life 
cycle. The use phase too, based on an assumed useful life of 
150,000 kilometres, is analysed in detail. Fuel consumption 
and CO₂ emissions are computed using the statutory New  
European Driving Cycle. In addition, we also calculate the 
amount of energy consumed in end-of-life dismantling and 
recycling of vehicle components. Together, these calcula-
tions enable us to compute all airborne and water-borne 
emissions, all emissions released into the soil and all waste 
and wastewater generated during the life cycle of the vehicle. 
The second stage in the Life Cycle Assessment is the Life Cy-
cle Impact Assessment, which calculates the potential envi-
ronmental impacts of the vehicle. The various material flows 
from the manufacturing, use and recycling phases are clas-
sified into five environmental impact categories: global 
Management approach    Climate protection    life cycle assessments    Efficient vehicles/production    Sustainable mobility    Traffic noise   
Green logistics/IT    Resource efficiency    Water    Biodiversity    Awards    Think Blue. Factory.

warming potential, photochemical ozone creation poten-
tial, acidification potential, ozone depletion potential and 
eutrophication potential. This process involves defining an 
indicator substance for each environmental impact catego-
ry. Carbon dioxide (CO₂), for example, is the indicator sub-
stance for the impact category “global warming potential”. 
All other substances that also contribute to global warming 
are then expressed in terms of this category indicator – as 
“CO₂ equivalents”. 
In the third stage, a materials composition analysis shows 
the constituent materials of which a given vehicle is com-
posed. From this analysis, it can be seen how much primary 
energy is consumed over the complete life of the vehicle, and 
also how much CO₂, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ni-
trogen oxides, hydrocarbons and methane the vehicle emits. 
The final stage in a comparative Life Cycle Assessment is 
certification. The requirements for this process are de-
fined in ISO 14040. Volkswagen arranges for external audi-
tors, such as the TÜV NORD technical inspectorate, to veri-
fy its compliance with this standard. Following validation, 
Volkswagen provides a transparent presentation of the LCA 
results in an Environmental Commendation. A recent ex-
ample, published during the reporting period, is the Envi-
ronmental Commendation for the new Golf.

EFFICIENt vEHICLEs 
In order to become the most sustainable automobile 
manufacturer in the world by 2018, Volkswagen has de-
fined the following product-related goals:  
> To offer the most efficient and environmentally compati-
ble model in every segment and vehicle class in which 
Volkswagen is represented
> To reduce CO₂ emissions from its European new-car 
fleet by 30 percent between 2006 and 2015
> To ensure that every new vehicle generation is on aver-
age 10 to 15 percent more efficient than its predecessor
> To offer efficiency technologies such as start-stop and recu-
peration systems as standard equipment on all new models
> To ensure that newly launched models always offer better 
life cycle environmental performance than their prede-
cessors.
The new Golf is up to 100 kg lighter than its predecessor, despite increased comfort and safety.

Eco-compatible products 
In 2012, Volkswagen launched a raft of new models which set 
new standards in efficiency. One highlight was the launch of 
the Volkswagen brand’s new Golf. Despite the improved com-
fort and safety of this model, its DIN unladen weight has been 
reduced by up to 80 kilograms. This increases to as much as 
100 kilograms if frequently specified optional equipment – 
for example: four doors, or air conditioning – is taken into ac-
count. Fuel-saving technologies such as automatic start-stop 
and braking energy recuperation systems are fitted as stand-
ard equipment, i.e. at no additional cost.  
 87, 97
The technologies now incorporated in the Golf have 
achieved the following results:
> The CO₂ emissions of the entry-level petrol model have 
been reduced by 36 g CO₂/km (23 percent) compared 
with the previous model.
> The most popular petrol model, with 63 kW 1.2-litre TSI 
engine, is around 12 percent more efficient than its pre-
decessor. Its CO₂ emissions have been reduced from 129 
to 113 g/km. This also brings an improved efficiency rat-
ing, from “C” to “B”.
> The most popular diesel model, with 77 kW 1.6-litre TDI 
engine, is a full 17 percent more efficient than its prede-
cessor. Its CO₂ emissions have been reduced from 119 to 
99 g CO₂/km and as a result its efficiency rating has im-
proved from “B” to “A”.
> The newly developed ACT Active Cylinder Management 
system reduces fuel consumption by 0.5 l/100 km, and CO₂ 
emissions by 9 g CO₂/km (calculations based on the 103 kW 
TSI engine). Across the engine range as a whole, the new 
Volkswagen Golf achieves an average 14 percent improve-
ment in CO₂ emissions. Due to its popularity and large 
market share, the Golf has the leverage to make a signifi-
cant contribution in terms of reducing transport-related 
CO₂ emissions. Based on the current sales figures, the new 
Golf has the potential to reduce CO₂ emissions by 119,000 
tonnes annually, in the European market alone.  
 98
Efficient vehicles launched during the reporting year also 
included the eco up! With emissions of 79 g CO₂/km, the 
eco up! has the lowest CO₂ emissions of any internal com-
bustion-engined vehicle in the world. From 2013 onwards, 
further efficient models are due to be launched. As well as 
the third-generation Golf TDI BlueMotion, with fuel con-
sumption of 3.2 l/100 km, and CO₂ emissions of 85 g CO₂/
km, the first CNG version of the Golf TGI BlueMotion, a 
production  version of the e-Golf electric model and the 
first Golf TSI twinDRIVE are also planned.  
 99
At the Geneva Motor Show, the debut of the new A3 from 
the Audi brand marked a milestone in sustainable mobil-
ity. Thanks partly to the use of warm-formed steel, this car 
weighs just 1,175 kilograms – up to 80 kilograms less than 
At the 2012 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, MAN showed how rigor-
ous aerodynamic design can lead to big fuel savings.
In 2012, two eco up! models were supplied to the first customer, the 
municipal utility company in Neumünster, Germany.

the previous model. The Audi A3 also incorporates a range 
of efficiency technologies including direct injection, tur-
bocharging, thermal management and the start-stop 
function. As a result, the average fuel consumption of the 
new A3 has been reduced by 12 percent compared with its 
predecessor. Audi will expand the engine line-up for this 
model step by step. In the pipeline are high-efficiency, 
low-emission versions including a 1.4-litre TFSI engine 
with automatic cylinder deactivation, a CNG version and a 
1.6-litre TDI engine that achieves fuel consumption of just 
3.8 l/100 kilometres, and emits just 99 g CO₂/km.  
 100
The SEAT Leon, too, has shed weight. The new model is up 
to 100 kilograms lighter than its predecessor. The most ef-
ficient engine version, featuring start-stop system and re-
cuperation, has CO₂ emissions of just 99 g CO₂/km. Else-
where in the Group, the ŠKODA brand’s ŠKODA Rapid 
made its debut in 2012. The 1.6 l TDI GreenTec version has 
average fuel consumption of just 4.0 litres and emissions of 
106 g CO₂/km. Also in 2012, the Volkswagen brand’s new 
Gol 6 and Voyage 6 models for the South American market, 
with the Tecnologia para Economia (TEC) energy-saving 
package, were presented. 
Many further recent examples show just how serious  
Volkswagen is about its mission to become the most sus-
tainable automaker in the world by 2018. The Group brand 
Lamborghini for example is working to reduce its new 
models’ emissions by 35 percent. And Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles presented its Caddy blue-e-motion elec-
tric research vehicle. The eT! concept model too – an elec-
trically powered van with many intelligent extras – was 
widely acclaimed in 2012, winning an Ökoglobe award. At 
the 2012 IAA International Commercial Vehicle Show, 
MAN’s Concept S truck demonstrated the potential for sig-
nificant reductions in the fuel consumption – and CO₂ 
emissions – of trucks. Thanks to its revolutionary aerody-
namic design, the concept model’s drag coefficient is on a 
par with that of a car. Scania meanwhile presented its first 
Euro 6 engines back in 2011. The Scania R 480 Euro 6 was 
rated the most eco-compatible heavy-duty semitrailer trac-
tor on the market in 2012 and was voted “Green Truck 2012” 
by trade magazines.

fleet customers, achieving even better results than in the 
previous year. 94 participating organisations saved around 
1,785 tonnes of CO₂ and around 680,000 litres of fuel, with 
around 12,000 vehicles. In all, this environmental initiative 
covers 216,000 vehicles. But as vehicles in commercial 
fleets are on average roughly two thirds younger and cover 
three times the mileage of privately owned vehicles on av-
erage, the fleet vehicles exert almost ten times as much lev-
erage in terms of climate-compatible mobility.
Zero emissions, 100% emotion: electric mobility 
In 2013, the Volkswagen Group will launch its first produc-
tion electric vehicles (EV). ŠKODA will launch the Octavia 
Green E Line. Also starting in 2013, the Volkswagen brand, 
which is aiming to play the leading role in electric mobili-
ty by 2018, will be launching the all-electric e-Up! and  
e-Golf, along with a limited-production XL1 plug-in diesel 
hybrid.  
 102, 103  
In the first six months of 2012, the e-Golf took part in exten-
sive road testing. The total mileage recorded was equivalent 
to driving more than ten times round the world. For 180 days, 
a number of vehicles were field-tested by private and com-
mercial drivers, under real-world driving conditions. NABU 
too is testing the e-Golf, which is emission-free at the point 
of use. Further urban fleet testing also took place in France, 
Austria, Belgium, Japan and the USA.  
 105 
At other Group brands too, electric models are currently 
undergoing everyday field testing. For example Audi is tri-
alling the A1 e-tron and ŠKODA is testing the Octavia Green 
E Line. The latter has a range of 150 kilometres, sufficient 
to meet the needs of most European commuters.  
Ahead of the actual market launch of its electric vehicles, 
in the reporting year the Volkswagen brand took further 
measures to get the service network up to speed. It provid-
ed special training for service staff and outfitted workshops 
with all the necessary tools and equipment, such as the 
new VAS 6558A high-voltage diagnostic and measuring sys-
tem, launched in 2012. This means Volkswagen dealerships 
are already in a position to perform all relevant mainte-
nance and repair work on Volkswagen electric vehicles. At 
many dealerships, selected workshop employees have 
been trained as “electrically skilled personnel”. Work on 
high-voltage vehicle systems is performed by certified 
high-voltage technicians. Worldwide, some 43,000 electri-
cally skilled personnel are already employed at Volkswagen 
dealerships. A further 1,700 high-voltage technicians are 
based at 890 special high-voltage centres, while another 
110 high-voltage specialists are employed in the importers’ 
organisations. 
At the plants too, Volkswagen is now all set for the start of 
production of electric vehicles. Employees working on 
standard vehicle assembly processes, involving exclusively 
non-technical activities, have undergone general EV prod-
uct training. Other employees meanwhile have undergone 
training to work on specialised vehicle finishing technolo-
gies and are now competent and qualified to perform de-
fined electrical engineering tasks. 
However, all-electric powertrains are only one side of the 
coin. The concept of electric mobility also includes hybrid 
technology, in which an electric motor is combined with 
another propulsion system, such as an internal combus-
tion engine. For example, the Detroit Auto Show 2012 saw 
the debut of the new Jetta Hybrid, which is powered by a 
combination of a 1.4-litre TSI engine and an electric motor. 
Following the Touareg Hybrid, the new Jetta Hybrid is the 
second Volkswagen model with hybrid petrol-electric 
drive. Pre-ordering for German customers began in De-
cember 2012.

Major progress is still required to bring the electric car out 
of its niche and into the mass market – progress in terms of 
the battery and of the charging infrastructure. And ulti-
mately, each electric car is only as climate-friendly as the 
electricity that drives it.
Plug-in hybrids are emerging as a particularly promising 
powertrain solution. This type of powertrain comprises an 
internal combustion engine and an electric motor, the bat-
tery for which can be charged from a standard electrical 
power socket. Plug-in hybrids combine quiet, zero-emis-
sion operation in town with mid- and long-distance range 
capability and easy and convenient charging. In 2012, the 
Volkswagen Group pressed on with preparations for a ma-
jor product offensive. For example, the Porsche brand can 
launch plug-in hybrid versions of the Panamera and the 
918 Spyder. Plug-in hybrid versions of the Golf and Passat 
from Volkswagen will follow. Audi too will then enter the 
plug-in hybrid age with the launch of the Audi A3 and Audi 
Q7, to be followed shortly afterwards by the Audi A6 and 
Audi A8. Numerous plug-in hybrid models from other 
Group brands will follow.
Clear information builds trust
Volkswagen believes it has a duty to inform its customers 
as fully as possible about the options for achieving sus-
tainable mobility during the use phase of the product. 
Communication starts with the purchase of the vehicle, 
where efficiency badging identifies the most environmen-
tally friendly models and provides clear orientation for 
customers. At the Volkswagen brand for example, vehicles 
with the BlueMotion label are in each case the most fuel-
efficient Volkswagen models in their class. And the 
BlueMotion Technology label denotes a range of efficien-
cy packages including technologies such as the automatic 
start-stop function and braking energy recuperation. In 
future, BlueMotion Technology will be offered as stand-
ard on all new-model vehicles in Europe. Bi-fuel natural 
gas/petrol vehicles offered under the efficiency badge TSI 
EcoFuel emit around a quarter less CO₂ than similar pet-
rol-only models. And the Blue TDI label denotes vehicles 
which, thanks to exhaust aftertreatment, present very low 
nitrogen oxide emissions. At ŠKODA, extra-fuel-efficient 
models bear the GreenLine and GreenLine Technology 
badges, while SEAT uses the labels ecomotive and E-Eco-
In 2012, the new SEAT Leon made its debut. All models in the new LEON range are powered by state-of-the-art TDI and TSI engines, and all 
rank among the best-in-class on fuel consumption and emissions. The highlight is the Leon 1.6 TDI, with start/stop system, which returns 
combined fuel consumption of 3.8 l/100 km, with CO2 emissions of 99 g/km.

A further important source of information for customers 
of the Volkswagen brand is the Environmental Commen-
dation. In 2012 the Volkswagen brand once again used 
this communication medium to report on improvements 
in life cycle environmental performance achieved by new 
vehicles and technologies over their predecessors or ref-
erence models. Environmental Commendations provide 
information for customers, shareholders and stakehold-
ers about the improved environmental design of vehicles, 
components and processes. In all cases, the Environmen-
tal Commendation is based on a Life Cycle Assessment, 
which provides full data on the energy consumption, 
emissions and all other environmental impacts associat-
ed with a vehicle throughout its life cycle. The Life Cycle 
Assessments are verified and certified by TÜV NORD. 
They list product inputs in the form of types and quanti-
ties of raw materials and energy used during the manu-
facturing, use and recycling phases, along with outputs in 
the form of emissions. Summarised environmental data 
for all Volkswagen models is also provided in the “Envi-
ronmental Descriptions” on the Internet. 
In 2012, the Environmental Commendation for the new Golf 
was certified by TÜV NORD, confirming that the new model 
offers significantly better environmental performance than 
its predecessor, based on an ISO 14040/14044-compliant 
Life Cycle Assessment. Specifically, its life cycle CO₂ emis-
sions have been reduced by 11 percent for the petrol models 
and by 13 percent for the diesel models. A 12 percent im-
provement in raw materials efficiency results in substantial-
ly reduced resource consumption. 
As a communication measure to raise customer awareness 
of sustainable driving techniques, the Volkswagen Group 
also provides information on ways of reducing fuel con-
sumption, along with fuel-saver courses. In the case of the 
Volkswagen brand, the courses have been offered for many 
years under the label “Volkswagen Driving Experience”. 
More than 140,000 drivers have already taken part. In 2012, 
fuel-saver courses were also offered by Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles. 34 free-of-charge events, open to all cus-

Efficiency badges denote vehicles with the lowest fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and provide clear orientation for customers.

tomers and prospective customers, were organised for the 
Volkswagen Crafter. SEAT too provides fuel-saver tips for its 
customers, on a special website.  
 110
In addition to these communication measures, Volkswagen 
vehicles also feature a wide range of intelligent technolo-
gies designed to support a fuel-saving driving style. On the 
new Golf, these include a tyre pressure monitoring system, 
a visual gear change recommendation, an expanded start-
stop display and the optional ECO driving mode, which 
programs the engine management, air-conditioning and 
other auxiliary units for optimal fuel efficiency.  
 111
Creating incentives
Positive news about fuel-efficient driving can also motivate 
other drivers to adopt an eco-compatible driving style.  
Volkswagen therefore reports regularly on its latest success-
es in fuel-saving competitions and efficiency tests. For exam-
ple, in 2012, the ŠKODA Citigo triumphed in the 31st ŠKODA 
Economy Run, recording average fuel consumption of just 
2.97 l/100 km (and emissions of just 70.6 g CO₂/km), on the 
288.4-kilometre course. On behalf of the Volkswagen brand, 
the Polo BlueMotion too delivered a stunning performance 
in a fuel-saver challenge: in a competition,  participants 
were invited to guess how far the Polo BlueMotion could 
travel on just one tankful of fuel. Most people did not expect 
the vehicle to go anything like as far as the actual recorded 
distance of 1,564 kilometres, which works out at an average 
consumption of just 2.9 litres/100 km. 
Today, extensive use is also made of online media in product 
communication regarding sustainability. All Group brands 
have set up attractive and in some cases interactive Internet 
platforms for this purpose. The new, interactive version of 
the environmental magazine “dialoge” (“dialogues”) from 
Audi, launched in 2012, is just one example. 
 112
Customer dialogue at Volkswagen also includes the online 
social networks and mobile devices. Volkswagen is an  
active player in these areas, not least with fuel-saver 
eGames.  
 113
For 2012, Volkswagen is once again not aware of any cases 
in which its dialogue with customers and other stakehold-
ers, on any of the various platforms, failed to comply with 
legal requirements. All forms of product communication 
also conformed to ethical guidelines. Responsibility for 
meeting such requirements and guidelines lies with the in-
dividual brands. All publications of the Volkswagen Group 
are checked by the Communications department’s clear-
ing centre to ensure full compliance with ethical and legal 
guidelines. In 2012, no cases of non-compliance with these 
rules were identified. Nor were any cases reported of  
Volkswagen products being sold in markets where their 
sale was prohibited. As a result, during the period under 
review Volkswagen incurred no fines due to infringement 
of legal requirements regarding the supply and use of prod-
ucts and services. Needless to say, Volkswagen’s products 
are always in the spotlight of debate and critical analysis by 
stakeholders and the public (> pp. 22, 157).
ŠKODA GreenFuture
GreenFuture is based on three pillars: GreenProduct, 
GreenFactory and GreenRetail. The aim of this programme 
is to further improve sustainability at ŠKODA, focusing on 
efficient vehicles and more efficient resource use through-
out the company. By 2018, ŠKODA is aiming to reduce its 
energy and water consumption by 25 percent, to reduce 
emissions and to further increase its recycling perfor-
mance. With these measures, the Czech manufacturer will 
also contribute to achieving the environmental goals of the 
Volkswagen Group as a whole for 2018. The “GreenFuture” 
principles are part of the 2018 ŠKODA growth strategy, 
whose aim is to combine improved economic performance 
with reduced environmental impacts. All ŠKODA’s environ-
mental activities to further reduce resource consumption 
are now being integrated into, and coordinated through, 
the “GreenFuture” project. An expert team has been 
formed to ensure that these activities are managed even 
more effectively. The “GreenFuture” team reports directly 
to the ŠKODA Board of Management.

SUSTAINOVATION AWARD 2012 FOR “THINk BlUe. FACTORy.”
MORE tHAN AN UMBRELLA BRAND: tHE “tHINK BLUE.” MINDsEt
Volkswagen Passenger Cars has set itself the ambitious goal of 
becoming the most sustainable car brand in the world by 2018. 
All its activities in the field of environmental sustainability have 
now been integrated into a single philosophy: “Think Blue.” 
“Think Blue.” was launched three years ago, in a bid to make 
the brand’s environmental strategy internationally visible, 
transparent and above all accessible.  
 114
“Think Blue.” aims to inspire new thinking and new approaches, 
both within the Company and in Volkswagen’s external commu-
nications. “Think Blue.” is a holistic philosophy with three main 
themes: to develop and supply efficient products and technolo-
gies, to engage in an active dialogue to help people become 
more environmentally aware, and to support environmental  
projects and initiatives worldwide. Within the Company, “Think 
Blue.” has steadily developed and taken root in business units 
throughout the value chain. It all starts with the application of 
ever more ambitious standards of sustainability in the planning 
and design of the vehicles. Here the Technical Development de-
partment has drawn up ambitious environmental goals, de-
signed to ensure that significant environmental aspects in the 
areas of climate protection, resource conservation and health 
protection are taken into account at every stage in the life cycle, 
and are integrated in the development of all Volkswagen Passen-
ger Car models. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand refers to 
this strategy as “Think Blue. engineering.”  
 81
On the production side too, clear objectives have been formu-
lated through the international “Think Blue”.Factory. initiative. 
This programme’s exemplary integration of environmental and 
economic goals earned Volkswagen Passenger Cars the “Sustai-
novation Award 2012”, presented by the German business mag-
azine Wirtschafts-Woche and the Altran Foundation for Innova-
tion.  
 116 
To involve as many people as possible, “Think Blue.” has a clear 
and simple message: environmental protection is fun and 
doesn’t require sacrifices. Also, everybody can contribute in 
some way, as they go about their everyday lives. For Volks-
wagen, as an automaker, fuel consumption plays a key part in 
this thinking, particularly since an eco-friendly driving style can 
reduce fuel consumption by up to 25 percent. The international 
fuel-saving championship “Think Blue. World Championship 
2012.” is intended to raise awareness of fuel-saving driving 
techniques and to demonstrate the important influence of 
driver behaviour on fuel consumption. With this event Volks-
wagen Passenger Cars also shows that it is easy to get better 
mileage than the manufacturer’s official figures – even when, 
as in this event, challenges have deliberately been put in the 
drivers’ way. The 2012 championship was contested by the win-
ning teams from 18 national qualifying competitions. The logis-
tics, catering and accommodation arrangements for the “Think 
Blue. World Championship 2012.” were meticulously planned to 
minimise environmental impacts. As a final step, to make the 
event fully carbon-neutral, all emissions which could not be 
avoided were compensated through a Gold Standard-certified 
carbon offsetting project in Ceará, Brazil.
By the end of 2012, “Think Blue.” had been rolled out in more 
than 30 markets, and more will follow. Many projects have al-
ready been implemented, often in partnership with environ-
mental organisations. In each market, the idea is that activities 
should focus on the most urgent sustainability challenges in 
that particular country. Further encouragement, and confirma-
tion that Volkswagen’s “Think Blue.” strategy is on the right 
track, came recently from the well-known independent brand-
ing consultancy “Interbrand”. In the Interbrand report “Best 
Global Green Brands 2012”, Volkswagen improved its ranking to 
fourth and emerged as the greenest German brand.  
 117
The “Think Blue.” philosophy is also to be rolled out to Volks-
wagen dealerships. A range of modules are available for Volks-
wagen dealers looking to improve their eco-friendliness. For ex-
ample, the Volkswagen Dealer Buildings Consultancy can provide 
eco-friendly design tips for dealer premises. The consultants pro-
vide free-of-charge basic advice up front to identify improvement 
potential and, if such potential is found, can also offer more de-
tailed energy-saving advice, which includes suggestions for im-
provements or structural alterations to premises, tips on possible 
dealership upgrading and remodelling options, complete with 
cost estimates, and suggestions on energy awareness training for 
personnel. Other ideas dealers can adopt, and offer to their cus-
tomers, include “Clever Repair” solutions for the workshop, 
whereby parts are repaired rather than replaced, products such as 
efficient engine oils and low-rolling-resistance tyres, and services 
such as the BlueMotion safety check. In Germany, in collaboration 
with the German Nature Conservation and Biodiversity Union 
(NABU), dealers can also offer fuel-saver courses.

EFFICIENt PRODUCtION
Although the biggest share of the vehicle’s total life cycle 
impact is generated during the use phase or “service 
life”, the production phase too offers enormous poten-
tial for improving environmental sustainability. 
A closer look at energy consumption makes this clear. In 
2012, an average of 2.21 MWh of energy was consumed for 
every Volkswagen Group vehicle produced – a reduction of 
0.32 MWh compared with 2010. At first glance such im-
provements may seem small, but when multiplied by the 
total number of vehicles produced, they actually represent 
an important lever for improving sustainable production. 
Volkswagen’s goal of reducing the environmental impact 
of its production operations by 25 percent by 2018 is being 
systematically followed up at all currently participating 
sites. For example, at many Volkswagen brand plants, 
workshops have already been held to produce detailed 
roadmaps for the necessary ecological measures, com-
plete with a timeline for their phased implementation 
through 2018.  
 119, 121
Broadly speaking, the individual Group brands are each 
responsible for improving the efficiency of their own pro-
duction processes. Brand-level initiatives have been devel-
oped to identify improvement potential, develop strategies 
and solutions and implement action plans. These include 
the Green Future initiative at ŠKODA, Ecomotive at SEAT 
and “Think Blue.”Factory at the Volkswagen brand (> p. 
130). At Volkswagen Group level, an important landmark  
in the quest for improved production efficiency was the 
launch of the modular transverse matrix (MQB) for the 
Volkswagen, Audi, ŠKODA and SEAT brands.  
 13
To achieve further improvements in production efficiency, 
detailed analyses are carried out to systematically identify 
potential. At the Volkswagen brand, one example is the 
analysis of “LCA hotspots in the vehicle production 
phase”. This analysis identifies the most environmentally 
significant components and processes in the manufacture 
of the Polo, Golf and Passat. It has shown that in absolute 
terms, the upstream supply chains for sheet steel and 
blanks have the biggest impact on CO₂ emissions at the 
production stage. It also established that offcut waste  
(38 percent of raw material input) offers significant im-
provement potential, and that platinum-group metals 
(PGM) in catalytic converters, along with electronic com-
ponents and magnesium, make significant contributions 
relative to their weight. By carrying out analyses of this 
type, the Volkswagen Group brands can identify the most 
effective ways to make their production processes more ef-
ficient, thereby reducing energy consumption, emissions 
and consumption of valuable resources such as water and 
raw materials.  
 122
saving energy and using renewables
The following real-life examples from the reporting period 
illustrate some of the steps being taken by Volkswagen 
Group factories to make their production processes more 
energy-efficient. For the Volkswagen brand, since 2012 the 
Chattanooga plant in the USA has been using variably con-
trollable compressed air generating equipment in the 
manufacture of its vehicles. That is to say, the amount of 
compressed air generated is always matched to the amount 
required, at any given time. Baseload and intermediate de-
mand is met by turbo-compressors. At peak load periods, 
variable-speed-drive screw compressors also come on 
stream. The two variable speed drive compressors are rat-
ed for an operating pressure of six bar and can be con-
trolled in tandem and on demand. The overall result of 
these measures is a 15 percent reduction in energy con-
sumption.  
 85
In a further example, at the Volkswagen plant in Kaluga, 
Russia, hot exhaust gases from a natural-gas-fired boiler 
house at the plant are passed through a heat exchanger to 
recover heat. This is then used in the hot water system, sub-
stantially reducing energy consumption. In addition, the 
water temperature is now controllable over a wider range 
(110/60 °C instead of 110/90 °C). The overall result is an im-
provement of up to 5 percent in energy efficiency. If such a 
system were implemented at other sites as well, it can be 
assumed that the annual savings for a boiler house of 20 
MW capacity would be in the order of 1,000 MWh of energy, 
and 485 tonnes of CO₂.  
 85
With its environmental principles and goals for the pro-
duction plants, the Volkswagen Group ensures efficient

energy use at all Group sites. One current example is the 
start-up of an energy-efficient PXL servo press line at the 
Mladá Boleslav plant in the Czech Republic. An important 
innovation here is the use of decentralized servo motors. 
In place of one large motor driving the entire line as be-
fore, 14 significantly more efficient servo motors are now 
used. This design also allows extremely flexible adaptation 
of individual processes on the PXL line.  
 85
In order to reduce purchasing of primary energy from ex-
ternal suppliers, many Volkswagen sites are also looking 
to produce their own renewable energy. One example is 
the solar panel system on the roof of the Audi A3 body shop 
in Ingolstadt, which is capable of generating around 460 
MWh of electricity a year. Similar installations also came 
on stream at other plants during the reporting period, in-
cluding the Braunschweig (420 MWh/a) and Hanover (420 
MWh/a) plants. Early in 2013, a further solar facility com-
prising over 33,000 modules will be installed at the  
Volkswagen brand’s Chattanooga plant. And a new solar 
system installed by Group brand Lamborghini at its Sant’ 
Agata Bolognese plant brought a marked reduction in CO₂ 
emissions in the reporting period. With 17,000 square me-
tres of solar panels, this facility is the largest solar panel 
installation in the region. Further measures are now un-
der consideration with a view to further reducing this 
plant’s CO₂ emissions by as much as 50 percent. In Swit-
zerland meanwhile, Volkswagen has leased a low-head 
(run-of-river) power plant on the River Aare, with an in-
stalled capacity of 28.5 MW. Since late August 2011, this fa-
cility has been supplying power to the six Volkswagen 
plants in Germany.  
 85 
In mid-2012, an eco-friendly combined-cycle gas-and-steam 
power plant was installed at the Volkswagen plant in Kassel. 
This facility supplements the existing CHP plant. Combined 
generation of heat and power achieves high average annual 
efficiency of up to 75 percent. A similar system is also 
planned for the Wolfsburg plant.  
 85
In 2012, a new energy efficiency project was launched at 
the Volkswagen brand’s Emden plant. A new body shop at 
this plant uses approximately 3,500 of the building’s 5,000 
foundation piles as energy piles. These piles, which are 
driven 20 metres into the ground, extract geothermal 
cooling energy, which is used to provide cooling in the 
welding shops. This solution dispenses with the need to 
evaporate water in conventional cooling towers, thereby 
reducing freshwater consumption by 25,000 cubic metres 
annually. In summer, the near-surface geothermal ener-
gy is also used to provide cooling in the production shop. 
In winter, as required, the production shop can be heated 
with the aid of a heat exchanger, which extracts stored 
heat.  
 123
Sometimes, it is first necessary to actually increase ener-
gy consumption before the savings are achieved. Warm 
forming of sheet steel is a good example. The warm form-
ing process simultaneously forms and tempers the steel 
by cooling it from 950°C to around 175°C in a matter of sec-
onds. The yield strength of warm-formed steel is up to six 
times that of conventional deep-drawn steel, making it 
possible to produce thinner and lighter components. Al-
though the energy consumed during warm forming is ini-
tially higher, the total life cycle energy consumption of the 
vehicle is reduced significantly, due to its lower weight. 
The new Golf provides a good illustration. Weight savings 
of up to 100 kg mean that fuel consumption is reduced by 
as much as 23 percent, with a corresponding reduction in 
CO₂ emissions. Warm forming is therefore an important 
Continuous expansion: by 2018, Volkswagen is looking to generate 
more than 2.5 GWh of energy from renewable sources.

key to meeting the goal of reducing fleet-average emis-
sions below 120 g/CO₂ km. 
Less waste in the production sector
Despite increased production throughout the Group, and the 
introduction of new vehicle models, Volkswagen reduced its 
total waste quantities per vehicle produced (passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles) during the period under re-
view. In 2012, 188.72 kg of metallic waste was produced per 
vehicle (2011: 210.59), along with 10.62 kg of hazardous waste 
for recycling (2011: 11.27), 10.37 kg of hazardous waste for dis-
posal (2011: 9.86), 10.62 kg of non-hazardous waste for dispos-
al (2011: 11.74) and 34.46 kg of non-hazardous waste for recy-
cling (2011: 34.14). The overall reduction was mainly down to 
the use of more resource-efficient production processes. 
Production emissions reduced 
Despite increased energy consumption due to increased 
production and the inclusion of new plants in the reporting 
data, direct CO₂ emissions (scope 1) have fallen, from 
555.02 kg per vehicle in 2010 to 425.13 kg per vehicle in 2012. 
Other pollutant emissions have also been reduced signifi-
cantly. Direct NOx emissions were reduced by 51.07 kg per 
vehicle compared with 2011, to 271.01 g, and SO2 emissions 
were reduced by 48.46 g to 28.42 g. VOC emissions were re-
duced from 4,045 g per vehicle to 3,521 g. 
The Porsche brand’s Zuffenhausen plant illustrates one of 
many ways in which emissions can be reduced. At a new 
paintshop at this plant, a waste air treatment system has 
gone into operation which can filter out solvents using 
physical/mechanical processes. Wet-mechanical treat-
ment reduces solvent concentrations in the waste air to less 
than 50 mg C/m3. No fossil fuels are used in the operation 
of this system.
Many further examples of real improvements in efficient 
production were presented during practice-sharing at the 
Group Environmental Conference in mid-2012, where they 
were discussed by more than 400 experts from all brands 
and regions. Outstanding examples and suggestions were 
compiled in “commitment papers”, the aim of which is to 
further improve sharing of best-practice project data be-
tween the Group’s brands. In addition, representatives of 
the five high-volume brands Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, Volks-
wagen and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles took part in a 
questionnaire-based survey on the subject of efficient pro-
duction. Objectives, process landscapes and structures 
were mapped and documented, and outstanding initiatives 
in each market were identified. Finally, ideas for the opti-
misation or modification of higher-order processes and 
structures were developed, for use in a Group Environ-
mental Strategy. 
At the Audi plant in Ingolstadt, electrically-powered mini-trucks are 
used to collect paper and non-recyclable waste.
The warm forming process produces high-density steel with high 
strength and high crash safety. These qualities pave the way for  
efficient lightweight design and thus reduced fuel consumption.

sUstAINABLE MOBILItY 
Sustainable mobility is not just about building fuel-effi-
cient cars. It is also about integrating efficient vehicles 
and attractive services into a complex and heterogeneous 
network of structures and requirements such as changes 
in vehicle utilisation patterns, social and demographic 
trends, infrastructural and ecological challenges, and 
developments in the field of energy and technology. A 
global company like Volkswagen must take all these as-
pects into account as it develops a vision of sustainable 
mobility.  
vision
In a future world of sustainable mobility, the car will re-
main a key means of transport. However, it will also be-
come increasingly integrated with other modes of trans-
port such as buses, rail or two-wheeled transport. The 
mode of transport chosen will depend on the purpose of 
the individual journey. Road transport itself will be largely 
emission-free, and electric road vehicles will be integrated 
with the power grid. In some cases, future vehicles will op-
erate fully automatically, making optimal use of the finite 
infrastructure – both when driving and when parking. Ac-
cidents will be virtually eliminated, and assistance systems 
will support or even take over driving tasks. Close coopera-
tion between vehicles and traffic lights will reduce time 
spent waiting at lights. This in turn will reduce environ-
mental impacts and journey times. Vehicles will communi-
cate and cooperate with other vehicles and with infrastruc-
ture, thereby improving traffic flow.

Hiring not owning: the car-sharing trend
The car-sharing project Quicar, launched in Hanover in 
2011, saw further growth in 2012. The number of rental 
stations has now increased to 93, and well over 8,000 us-
ers have already registered for this scheme, showing that 
the Quicar concept is a good match for the needs of cus-
tomers. The average duration of a rental is 2.75 hours. 
Quicar is also in step with the continuing trend towards 
urbanisation. As vehicle utilisation patterns change, 
Flexible and convenient: with more than 8,000 users in Hanover and the surrounding region, the Quicar car-sharing 
project is already a hit.

within an increasingly dense urban environment, users 
are showing a growing interest in inter- or multimodal so-
lutions. Quicar slots perfectly into these changing usage 
patterns. This logically structured concept was one of the 
reasons Quicar came out “best in test”, with an overall 
score of 1.8, when German consumer institute Stiftung 
Warentest compared nine car-sharing providers from 
Germany and the Netherlands. “Booking”, “driving” and 
“online experience” were among the categories where 
Quicar impressed the testers.  
 139
In addition, Quicar also impressed customers with its fair 
pricing, which is also geared to target gruops with less 
available income. During the reporting period, further 
steps were taken to integrate Quicar into regional commu-
nities and infrastructures. Quicar entered into new coop-
eration arrangements, for example with the Edeka super-
market chain and with Studentenwerk, a students’ welfare 
organisation in Hanover, or with LifeThek, an online lend-
ing service for everyday articles. In cooperation with these 
partners, Quicar developed customised packages and 
opened new rental stations. An agreement was also signed 
with the Greater Hanover Transport Association (GVH), 
giving around 100,000 GVH season-ticket holders reduced-
rate access to Quicar.  
 140
Another solution catering to the needs of an increasingly 
urban society is the MicroCity concept, developed by  
Volkswagen Group Research.

Challenges of the shift to renewables
The shift in energy production towards renewable sources 
presents huge opportunities, and also many challenges, in-
cluding expansion of the power grid, integration of energy 
sources with highly intermittent output, such as wind and 
solar power, the development of smart grid and grid storage 
solutions for improved load management and the quest for

sustainable biofuels. Solutions being explored under Audi’s 
“future energies” initiative include ways of integrating mo-
bility into the energy landscape of the future and ways of de-
veloping practical and drivable carbon-neutral vehicles for 
short- and long-range transportation.  
 143
One objective is to use wind-power-generated electricity ei-
ther to power electric vehicles directly or to power produc-
tion of hydrogen at the “e-gas” plant in Werlte. The plant 
will also be capable of combining the hydrogen with CO₂ to 
produce synthetic natural gas, which could be fed into the 
existing natural gas network. The hydrogen could be used 
in future to power fuel-cell vehicles while the natural gas 
could be used, from as soon as the end of 2013, to power 
Audi TCNG natural gas models. The e-gas facility currently 
being built in Werlte will be the world’s first power-to-gas 
plant. Due to come on stream in the third quarter of 2013, it 
will feed gas to the natural gas grid as a backup for inter-
mittent renewable energy. In addition to the e-gas project, 
Audi is also working on other “e-fuels” based on CO₂ and 
renewable energy with the aim of providing future Audi 
customers with carbon-neutral mobility. Examples include 
e-thanol and e-diesel, which are being developed in coop-
eration with innovative project partners in the USA. No bio-
mass is required to produce these fuels, nor do they divert 
arable land from food production.  
 143, 144
The “Electric Mobility Fleet Test”, launched in 2008, is look-
ing at the implications of large-scale use of renewable energy 
to power electric vehicles. Volkswagen is using 20 current-
generation Golf Estate twinDRIVE models as research vehi-
cles in this test. In urban driving, their plug-in hybrid drive 
system operates mainly in zero-emission electric mode. The 
Golf twinDRIVE research project is focusing particularly on 
integration of the electric vehicle into the power grid. Mean-
while, in Berlin, the Volkswagen Group is taking part in the 
Effizienzhaus Plus project, which is aiming to demonstrate 
how sustainable living can dovetail with carbon-neutral driv-
ing. The Volkswagen Group is contributing an Audi A1 e-tron 
and two Volkswagen e-Golf models to this project.  
 146
Mobility research: revealing future options
Volkswagen has for many years been carrying out mobili-
ty research aimed at obtaining a holistic understanding 
of automotive mobility within the wider context of alter-
native modes of transport, human settlement patterns, 
transport infrastructures, public policy and urban devel-
opment. On this basis it aims to derive strategic conclu-
sions for future automotive development.  
 147
In 2012 once again, a wide range of dialogues, discussions 
and workshops took place. Often the focus was on broad-
based mobility strategies under the headings of Reduce, 
Transfer or Improve and the potential contributions of 
such strategies to future sustainable mobility. Volkswagen 
thinks it is important to gain as sound and accurate a pic-
ture as possible of the respective potential of these strate-
gies, and how it can best be exploited. Volkswagen has 
long believed that the urban – and rural – mobility of the 
future will require an intelligent mix of different trans-
port modes. What mix ultimately emerges will depend not 
least on the innovation capability – among other things in 
terms of intermodal potential – of the different modes of 
transport.  Accurately predicting the potential for modal 
shifts is a challenging task. Equally difficult to assess is 
the potential contribution of mobility services to im-
proved transport, the potential for operating such servic-
es cost-effectively and the potential for improved access. 
Human behaviour modelling is an extremely complex task 
when it comes to modal choice. In this field, Volkswagen 
is therefore working with a range of well-known organi-
sations, including scientific bodies such as ETH Zurich or 
the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the Fraun-
hofer Gesellschaft, as initiator of the Morgenstadt (city of

In a variety of projects, Volkswagen has taken further steps 
towards the goal of sustainable mobility. One of these pro-
jects is the KOLINE project, which aims to reduce the ad-
verse effects of traffic light stops. The associated braking, 
acceleration and waiting times have a significant impact 
on urban traffic emissions. In a bid to reduce the amount 
of time cars spend stopped at lights, the KOLINE project 
adopts a “cooperative” approach. The Volkswagen KOLINE 
research vehicle uses car-to-infrastructure (C2X) commu-
nication to optimise its approach to the lights. This (tacti-

cal) driving strategy is implemented using a near-produc-
tion system for active longitudinal vehicle control (i.e. speed 
management). In addition, (strategic) model-based optimi-
sation of traffic signal control is also performed, throughout 
the urban road network, using infrastructure- and vehicle-
related sensor data. Simulations performed to date show 
significant potential for reducing the number of stops, fuel 
consumption and emissions. The project concluded in au-
tumn 2012 with the successful testing and demonstration of 
the system on public roads. 
In a further project, INEES, Volkswagen and other project 
partners are researching the possibilities for integrating 
electric vehicles into the electricity market. The project is 
concerned with intelligent grid integration of electric vehi-
cles and provision of vehicle-to-grid services. Over the com-
ing years, project activities will include a field test to collect 
data on the smart charging and discharging of EV batteries. 
Raising public awareness
An important prerequisite for sustainable mobility is 
public awareness. Volkswagen supported a number of 
projects in this area in 2012, including the Audi Urban Fu-
ture Initiative. This initiative, which includes an architec-
tural award with the biggest purse in Germany, aims to 
provide a better understanding of how major world cities – 
and urban mobility – will develop in future. Learning more 
about the future face of the city is important in order to as-
sess what forms of personal mobility will still be possible in 
this context. In order to influence these future develop-
ments today, Audi aims to identify significant urban plan-
ning trends from around the world and assess their rele-
vance for future mobility. The 2012 award was won by the 
Boston architecture practice Höweler + Yoon Architecture, 
for their “New American Dream” concept for the metro-
politan region Boston/Washington. The US firm developed 
an ambitious architectural and urban planning vision cen-
tred on the “Shareway”, a revolutionary means of commut-
ing between home and workplace. The basic idea involves 
merging private and public transport into a new kind of 
mobility platform, where the existing infrastructure is 
combined with intelligent traffic flows and networks. The 
“New American Dream” is based on a new social consen-
sus, where the focus is on community, and where sharing 
is more important than ownership.

Another example is the “Stauspiel” exhibit at Autostadt 
Wolfsburg, an interactive simulation where visitors see 
how and why congestion can sometimes develop “out of 
thin air”, bringing traffic to a standstill. “Stauspiel” was de-
veloped on the basis of current research data, as a joint 
project of the Institute for Transport & Economics of Dres-
den University of Technology and Volkswagen Group Re-
search. The simulation is unique in this form. 
Sustainable mobility is not just a vision for the future.
Volkswagen is currently working to improve traffic flow in 
and around its Wolfsburg site. To this end, the Company 
has joined with the City of Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg AG and 
Autostadt to form a Transport Task Force and draw up a 
coordinated traffic concept. Here too the approach is fo-
cused not just on the car but on an intelligent mix of trans-
port modes. As well as enhancing traffic flow and park-
ing, the initiative is also aiming to improve public 
transport, along with the cycle track and footpath net-
works. Concrete results have already emerged: for exam-
ple a second exit lane has been added from the A39 motor-
way, leading to the factory gate. This has significantly 
reduced tailbacks in the morning rush hour. Also, several 
thousand new parking spaces have been created all 
around the factory, while reserved parking continues to be 
provided close to the factory for car pools (of three or more 
employees). Traffic light phasing has been improved, while 
for bus and rail users, more buses have been laid on and 
timetables have been extended. Within the plant, employ-
ees can use internal shuttle services to get to their office or 
from their office to a meeting elsewhere in the plant. The 
impact on commuter traffic emissions is shown in the 
SCOPE 3 inventory (> p. 143). 
tRAFFIC NOIsE
Cars, buses and trucks, motorcycles, trams and trains all 
generate noise which impacts on the health and quality 
of life of urban residents in particular. Safeguarding mo-
bility while at the same time reducing noise is a chal-
lenge.
Volkswagen is facing up to this challenge not only by devel-
oping ever quieter vehicles but also through intensive ac-
tivities in the field of traffic noise in general. The aim is to 
gain a better understanding of the contribution of the car 
to traffic noise, as a basis for deciding which tasks should 
in future be the responsibility of the vehicle manufacturers 
themselves and which tasks require a more broadly fo-
cused approach, involving dialogue with other stakehold-
ers.
In cooperation with internationally recognised partners, a 
“noise level tool” has been developed. Based on a model 
city, the tool can be used to carry out a quantitative compar-
ison of noise-reduction measures, looking at their effect in 
terms of both noise levels and numbers of people exposed 
to noise. The focus is on traffic noise in general, not the in-
dividual vehicle. A new feature of this tool is that for the 
first time it also addresses noise “immissions”, that is to 
say how much noise actually “reaches” how many of the 
city’s inhabitants. In the past, a focus exclusively on the 
emissions side – the sources of noise − resulted in a distort-
ed picture of the effectiveness of noise-reducing measures. 
Factors which influence noise immissions include traffic 
volumes, the relative numbers of cars and trucks on the 
road, speeds, type of road surface, powertrain noise and 
tyre/road noise. 
Volkswagen believes these activities can result in better co-
ordination of future noise reduction measures and more 
effective targeting of funding.
Volkswagen’s work on vehicle noise reduction at the Acous-
tics Centre in Wolfsburg is focused on improvements to the 
powertrain – comprising the engine, the transmission, the 
drive shafts and the air intake and exhaust system – and on 
tyre/road noise. Noise is a particularly important consider-
ation for Volkswagen when selecting original equipment 
tyres. The Volkswagen brand therefore only uses products

which comply with the noise limits set by Germany’s Blue 
Angel eco-label system. Audi has its own test procedure for 
approving original equipment tyres, which goes well be-
yond the actual statutory requirements. 
GREEN LOGIstICs
Volkswagen Logistics took further action to reduce 
environmental impacts from the transport of prod-
ucts and materials during the period under review. 
Measures were geared to ensuring that logistics prod-
ucts and processes deliver sustained environmental 
value.  
Volkswagen has identified the following significant envi-
ronmental aspects for this sector at the present time: en-
ergy consumption, emissions, fine particulate pollution, 
water consumption and waste. To achieve improvements 
in these areas, the following action areas have been de-
fined:   
> reduction in freight traffic, for example through opti-
mised transport structures, a reduction in the number of 
empty runs and improved load factors 
> a shift from road transport to other modes of transport 
> reduction in fuel consumption through use of efficient 
technologies.  In 2012, Volkswagen made progress in im-
plementing these strategic objectives, as the following 
examples show.
“Green Trains” have now gone into service on further 
routes. On the Wolfsburg to Zwickau line, Volkswagen has 
become the first German car manufacturer to use DB Schen-
ker Rail’s EcoPlus trains for the transport of materials. Eco-
Plus trains are powered entirely by renewable energy. 
On the car transport side, a further route went over to 
EcoPlus during 2012: “Green Trains” are now being used 
to transport new vehicles on the 693-kilometre journey 
from Audi’s Neckarsulm plant in South Germany to the 
North Sea port of Emden, for onward shipment. The re-
sult is a saving of 38 kilograms in CO₂ emissions per vehi-
cle transported, and a saving of 3,420 tonnes in total 
emissions per annum. 
The Group brand Scania significantly reduced CO₂ emis-
sions from internal freight traffic operations at its 
Södertälje site in Sweden in 2012 with the acquisition of 
eight trucks powered by bioethanol ED95. Using bioetha-
nol instead of iesel reduces CO₂ emissions by approxi-
mately 70 percent.  
 136
Scania has also set up a wholly owned subsidiary, Scania 
Transportlaboratorium AB, to assess the characteristics 
and performance of vehicles used in commercial haulage 
and to train drivers in fuel-efficient, eco-friendly driving. 
In the space of one year, drivers in the Transportlaborato-
rium test fleet reduced their average fuel consumption 
from 33 to 27 litres/100 km. This represents an annual sav-
ing of €30,000 per truck and reduces the total annual CO₂ 
emissions of the fleet as a whole by 1,300 tonnes. Impor-
tantly, it has also been established that eco-friendly driving 
does not have to be at the expense of speed. In fact, Scania 
Transport Laboratory drivers improved their on-time de-
livery rate from 93 to 99 percent. 
At the Wolfsburg site, the new Multimodal Logistics Centre 
Wolfsburg (MLW) was opened in October 2012. This hub 
centrally controls supplies of vehicle components and 
parts to overseas Volkswagen plants and the supply of new 
and used vehicles to Volkswagen dealers in the local re-
gion. 
With the new Logistics Centre for materials and vehicles, 
Volkswagen is combining two key logistics functions. 
From this 200,000 square metre site in the Fallersleben 
area of Wolfsburg, Volkswagen Logistics will firstly coor-
dinate the shipment of new and used vehicles to dealer-
ships in the Wolfsburg, Hanover, Braunschweig, Celle, 
Göttingen and Magdeburg regions, and will provide tech-
nical services for these dealerships. Secondly, as well as 
handling the shipment of vehicles, the centre will also 
supply CKD (Completely Knocked Down) parts and com-
ponents sets to overseas production plants of the Volks-
wagen Group. 
Together with the inland port planned by GVZ Entwick-
lungsgesellschaft Wolfsburg, the new Logistics Centre will 
form a highly efficient hub offering trimodal (road, rail 
and water) transport capability.

The sustainability of the new Logistics Centre is further 
underscored by its eco-friendly use of recycled materials 
in the base layers under outdoor asphalt surfaces, a so-
lar hot water heating system, LED office and outdoor 
lighting and a soundproofed building to reduce noise 
from night-time vehicle loading and unloading opera-
tions. 
GREEN It
Improved IT infrastructures and equipment offer 
great potential for further improving resource and en-
ergy efficiency.  
Particularly in view of the large number of computer 
workstations in the Company, Green IT offers Volkswagen 
significant scope for reducing its use of consumables and 
energy and, by the same token, its CO₂ emissions. Green 
IT is also a key to more efficient networking in a global 
corporation. 
A major project from the period under review indicates the 
scale of potential savings: in 2011, Volkswagen launched 
iDOMP, a global tender process for approximately 35,000 
printers. As part of this process, shortlisted printers and 
suppliers were subjected to a green IT evaluation covering 
the entire life cycle of the product – from the materials 
and type of packaging used to reductions in energy con-
sumption and reduced electronic scrap at the end of the 
product life cycle. Following this evaluation, in 2012 the 
supplier structure was optimised and the existing print-
ers are now being replaced. By the time the changeover is 
completed, the printer fleet as a whole will be 32 percent 
more energy-efficient than the previous fleet, resulting in 
annual energy savings of 2.18 GWh. A one-off 33 percent 
reduction in packaging volumes and a 36,000 kilogram 
reduction in the volume of items packaged with the prod-
 ucts have also been achieved.
To further emphasise the sustainability of the new print-
ers, Volkswagen is working with the printer manufacturer 
and the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation 
Union (NABU) to develop a new carbon offset project, 
Audi’s new data centre at the Ingolstadt plant provides 2,000 square metres of space for 6,000 highly efficient servers. The TÜV Rheinland 
technical inspectorate has issued the data centre with a “premium” certificate – its highest energy efficiency rating.

aimed at fully offsetting the CO₂ emissions associated 
with delivery, use and take-back of the products, taking 
into account not only the energy consumption of the 
printers themselves but also energy consumption for 
toner, paper, packaging and visits by service engineers. 
Volkswagen will offset these unavoidable CO₂ emissions 
with gold standard carbon offset certificates issued by 
The Gold Standard Foundation. Also, as a further contri-
bution to protecting the natural environment and reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions, in Germany Volkswagen 
is investing in moorland restoration projects managed by 
NABU. All calculations for this project are being per-
formed by ClimatePartner Deutschland GmbH and certi-
fied by Société Générale de Surveillance Holding GmbH 
(SGS).
REsOURCE EFFICIENCY 
In its environmental goals, Volkswagen has committed it-
self to the responsible use and best possible conservation 
of natural resources. 
Important levers for improving resource efficiency – in  
addition to energy efficiency (> p. 111), efficient water use  
(> p. 123) and improving air quality through reduced pollut-
ant emissions (> p. 112) – include responsible use of natural 
materials and efficient recycling. 
tracking and streamlining material flows 
To promote efficient and sustainable use of natural re-
sources, in 2012 Volkswagen established a Raw Materials 
Management Steering Group to systematically identify and 
analyse risks to raw materials supplies and take timely 
counter-measures. 
A helpful tool for ensuring more efficient resource use in 
the manufacturing process is material flow management. 
Material flow management allows transparent matching of 
energy and material flows to specific processes. It provides 
a basis for comparing different scenarios or technologies 
and identifying improvement opportunities. First launched 
in 2011, material flow management has been operating 
with an expanded and refined database since 2012, which 
has led to an improvement in the quality of the results. In 
the meantime the tool is being used to plan new paintshop 
facilities and assess existing ones. 
To handle the increasing level of detail generated in this 
modelling process, an operating wizard was developed 
which makes the system much more user-friendly. Small-
scale pilot projects are currently being conducted to assess 
the suitability of this tool for deployment across the Group. 
The high degree of product diversity means that it is not 
possible to produce generalized statistics on material flows 
for the range as a whole.  However, material flow analyses 
for many high-selling models can be found in the Environ-
mental Commendations, or the general brochure “The 
Lifecycle of a Car”.  
 125
Responsible use of resources goes hand in hand with a 
high level of materials efficiency. A high level of materi-
als efficiency means, for example, a smaller difference

between the weight of steel blanks entering the produc-
tion process and that of the finished component. This in 
turn reduces the amount of offcut waste that needs to be 
recycled. In the new Golf, introduced during the report-
ing period, materials efficiency was increased by 12 per-
cent. 
Materials efficiency 12 percent up in the Golf
The efficient use of materials is an important factor in 
terms of total operating costs, environmental protection, 
and a cost-efficient production process. A breakdown of 
the materials used in the new Golf provides an example in 
which the materials efficiency has been improved by 12 
percent compared to its predecessor. Among other mate-
rials used, 62.9 percent of the vehicle consists of steel and 
iron materials, 19.5 percent of polymers and 8.2 percent 
of light alloys, cast and wrought alloys.
Responsible and economical use of raw materials is a man-
datory requirement at all our sites worldwide. 2012 saw a 
number of successes in this area. The following are some 
examples of the improvements achieved: 
Bodywork components are made from sheet metal coils. 
Due to the complex shape of the body components, consid-
erable quantities of offcuts are generated during this pro-
cess. The Volkswagen brand’s Wolfsburg plant has there-
fore reduced coil widths. It has also made improvements to 
tools, component geometries and the nesting of blanks. 
The result is a substantial improvement in materials effi-
ciency on the production line for the new Golf, with a 15 
percent reduction in waste volumes compared with the 
predecessor model. These and improvements to other 
models since 2011 have reduced steel consumption by ap-
proximately 73,000 tonnes annually compared with 2006. 
In the paintshop at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, 48 
state-of-the-art painting robots went into operation in 2012. 
Their innovative colour change and application systems re-
duce consumption of materials by up to 50 percent. The ro-
bots also consume up to 20 percent less compressed air and 
significantly less energy, cutting CO₂ emissions by 120 
tonnes per year. There are cost benefits too, with annual sav-
ings of €800,000 at the Wolfsburg plant alone.  
 85
Joint commitment 
In 2012, together with other large corporations, SMEs and 
universities, Volkswagen launched the ValueRess project. 
Volkswagen’s contribution to this project, which will have a 
three-year timeline, will include LCA and Raw Materials 
Analysis methodologies. In 2012, Volkswagen once again 
worked within industry associations to promote efficient, 
sustainable resource use not only in-house but also at indus-
try level. For example Volkswagen is participating in the Fed-
eration of German Industry (BDI)’s Ad Hoc Working Group 
on Resource Efficiency Programmes. Resource efficiency is-
sues are also discussed for example with the European Auto-
mobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), e.g. in the Work-
ing Group Industrial Emissions.
The Volkswagen Group is constructively supporting the polit-
ical process at German and European level in the field of re-
source efficiency. Among recent developments, in 2012 the 
German government adopted its Resource Efficiency Pro-
gramme. And in 2011, the EU Commission published its road-
map for 2020, defining a policy framework for a resource-ef-
ficient Europe, aimed at setting Europe on track to become 
the world’s most resource-efficient region. The EU Commis-
sion is currently working on the first step towards this goal, 
by developing resource efficiency indicators. Volkswagen is 
playing an active role here, and sharing its own experiences 
regarding optimisation of resource efficiency.
Recycling gains life cycle credits
A further important instrument for promoting resource  
efficiency is recycling. Reuse of recycled material reduces 
the need for extraction and processing of primary resourc-
es. In the LCA, therefore, recycling can effectively be treat-
ed as a life cycle “credit”. At Volkswagen, recycling capabil-
ity is built into new vehicles from the very beginning of the 
development process, ensuring that the company’s new ve-
hicles are now 85 percent recyclable. And thanks to the 
Volkswagen SiCon process, which is capable of recycling 
shredder residues, end-of-life vehicles are even 95 percent 
recoverable.  
 126
One of Volkswagen’s core environmental goals is to re-
duce its consumption of primary raw materials. This is 
why use of quality-assured recycled materials is explicitly

stated as a requirement in Volkswagen’s general environ-
mental specifications, which apply to all projects. The re-
cycled content of the new Golf, calculated by means of a 
certified method based on DIN EN ISO 14021:2012, is be-
tween 34 and 35 percent of vehicle weight.  
 127, 128
Not all vehicle components may require recycling. Many 
can be reconditioned and then reused. This is the princi-
ple behind the Volkswagen brand’s Genuine Remanufac-
tured Parts programme, which recently celebrated its 
65th anniversary. Since the programme was first launched, 
a total of approximately 7.9 million remanufactured en-
gines, 2.9 million remanufactured transmissions and 
over 78 million other remanufactured components have 
been sold. The current Genuine Remanufactured Parts 
range comprises more than 16,000 components from 63 
product groups. Genuine remanufactured parts cost on 
average 40 percent less than genuine new parts, while 
nevertheless offering as-new quality and functionality, 
and being backed by the same warranty. And in addition 
to the benefits for the customer, this is good news above 
all for the environment. For example, engine remanufac-
turing alone delivers annual savings in the order of 7,000 
tonnes of steel.  
 129
Since electric vehicles contain relatively large amounts of 
valuable resources such as cobalt, lithium and rare earth 
metals, in 2012 recycling was also an issue in Volks-
wagen’s preparations for electric mobility. Cobalt in par-
ticular is for the most part fully recyclable and reusable. 
This has been demonstrated amongst other things by the 
LithoRec research project, in which Volkswagen partici-
pated. Tests carried out for this project showed that 90 
percent of the raw materials used in a lithium-ion battery 
can be recovered.

Tree-planting under way on mountainsides in the Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park. In the course of this reforestation project, 
420,000 trees have been planted, 47,000 soakaways have been dug and 350 sizeable dams have been built to date. These measures are 
contributing around 2.6 million m3 to groundwater replenishment annually.

Volkswagen uses this valuable resource sparingly and 
responsibly. Key points in Volkswagen’s sustainable 
water management policy include reduced water con-
sumption, reduced wastewater volumes, treatment of 
wastewater and protection of habitats in and around 
water. 
Sustainable water management is anchored in the Group’s 
Environmental Principles: three of the 22 Environmental 
Principles for Production Plants are directly concerned with 
water, and the responsible member of the Board of Manage-
ment is kept informed of issues and progress regarding their 
implementation. Ultimately, water shortages represent an 
economic risk for Volkswagen, given that our production pro-
cesses are dependent on this indispensable resource.  
 24
In 2012, the water supplies of Volkswagen AG and Volks-
wagen Sachsen GmbH were taken from surface water (0.77 
million m3), groundwater (2.14 million m3), on-site rainwa-
ter harvesting and treatment (1.85 million m3) and water 
supplied by public utility companies (3.67 million m3). Dur-
ing this period, the various forms of water withdrawal are 
not known to have caused damage to the ecosystem of these 
water sources. In fact, in Mexico the measures undertaken 
are contributing approximately 2.6 million m3 annually to 
groundwater replenishment – significantly in excess of the 
amount the Volkswagen Puebla plant actually withdraws 
from the groundwater. Wastewater discharges are in line 
with the official permits and are closely monitored.
Volkswagen is aiming to reduce water consumption across 
all plants by 25 percent by 2018 over 2010 levels. Impor-
tant strides have already been made towards this goal:  
between 2010 and 2012, water consumption per vehicle 
produced fell by 0.45 m3 (scope 1). Wherever possible, 
Volkswagen aims to recycle water. The Salzgitter plant, for 
example, where all production wastewater is treated in an 
evaporator, achieves zero-wastewater production. In 2011, 
25,251 m3 of industrial wastewater was treated and recy-
cled in this way. Aggregate Group figures for water recy-
cling are not yet available.  
 121
Under its GreenFuture initiative, the Group brand ŠKODA is 
aiming to source 80 percent of its process water require-
ments from treated rainwater by 2018. This kind of closed-
loop water recovery is key to efficient water use. 
Water footprint – knowing where water is consumed 
Using the water footprint, calculated on the basis of the 
Life Cycle Assessments, Volkswagen is able to identify those 
processes in the automobile life cycle with the highest wa-
ter consumption. This analysis shows that most water is 
consumed by upstream material production and supply 
processes.  
Use of water resources at Volkswagen is audited and veri-
fied to rigorous standards such as DIN ISO 14001 or the EU 
Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Water is also 
a regular and important topic on the agenda of the Region-
al Environmental Conferences, and was a focus of exten-
sive practice-sharing at the fourth Group Environmental 
Conference in 2012.
transparent information
Volkswagen provides transparent information to stake-
holders about its management of water resources, and ac-
tion it is taking to reduce the risk of water shortages. Since 
2011, Volkswagen has been participating in the Water Dis-
closure Project (WDP). This non-profit organisation col-
lects water-related data from questionnaires submitted by 
participating companies. It analyses and evaluates this in-
formation and – with the approval of the reporting compa-
ny – makes the results available to the public. In 2012, 
Volkswagen was the only German vehicle manufacturer to 
consent to publication.  
 132
saving water in everyday industrial operations
At the end of 2012, one of the most advanced wastewater 
treatment plants in China came on stream at the new 
Volkswagen plant in Foshan. The wastewater is recycled 
in an environmentally compatible process that returns 
100 percent of the water to the factory. Here it is used for, 
among other things, the rain test in the assembly shop 
and to replenish the cooling water. As a result, the plant’s 
freshwater uptake has been reduced by some 30 percent. 
During the site approval process, agreements were al-

ready drawn up on future water use, and plans were de-
veloped for a biological treatment plant. Wastewater fed 
to this central Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) plant is ini-
tially treated using bacteria. The water is then filtered 
through a membrane with an area of approximately 6,000 
square metres, before being disinfected. The resulting 
water, which is virtually of drinking water quality, is used 
as cooling tower feed water (cooling and process water), 
and also for green area watering and toilet flushing. The 
MBR biological treatment plant achieves 98 percent COD 
(Chemical Oxygen Demand) and BOD (Biological Oxygen 
Demand) reduction. It is the first of its kind in the Chi-
nese automobile industry and the largest in the Volks-
wagen Group. Further water-saving measures at the new 
site include a rinsing water recycling system in the paint-
shop and a dry overspray separation system.
The Volkswagen brand’s plant in Taubaté, Brazil, pro-
vides a further example of efficient water management. 
Expansion of the paintshop at this plant has further im-
proved efficiency. A state-of-the-art primerless painting 
process combined with an innovative overspray separa-
tion system has reduced water consumption by 20 per-
cent.  
 133, 134
Efficient water use is also a top priority at the Puebla plant 
in Mexico. The expanded water strategy introduced at this 
plant in 2012 comprises an extensive range of measures: 
> rainwater is collected in lagoons for use as process wa-
ter or in cooling towers, 
> rainwater from rooftops is collected, filtered through 
layers of turf, earth, stone and geotextiles and then fed 
to a buffer tank, 
> treated wastewater is used to flush toilets or to water 
green areas, 
> existing showerheads and taps are being replaced by 
more water-efficient fittings. 
With these and other measures, the plant has cut statisti-
cal water consumption from 5.1 m3 per vehicle in 1999 to 
approximately 3.0 m3 in 2012. In 2013, the plant is aim-
ing to reduce this figure below the 3.0 m3 mark. At the 
Chattanooga plant too, rainwater is being captured by 
smart collection systems and used for toilet-flushing, 
amongst other applications. In 2012, rainwater for more 
than 700,000 toilet flushes was collected, with a corre-
sponding reduction in freshwater consumption.  
In 2012, Volkswagen also reported positive results from 
its ongoing reforestation project in the vicinity of the Pop-
ocatépetl volcano in Mexico. Since 2008, the Company 
has reforested a total area of 750 hectares on the slopes of 
this volcano. The trees stabilise the ecosystem and im-
prove rainwater retention. So far 420,000 trees have 
been planted, 47,000 soakaways have been constructed 
and 350 sizeable dams have been built. These measures 
are contributing around 2.6 million m3 to groundwater 
replenishment annually – significantly in excess of the 
amount the Volkswagen Puebla plant actually withdraws 
from the groundwater. 
For Volkswagen, responsible water management also 
means attempting to ensure that this resource is more 
fairly distributed in particularly drought-prone areas. To 
help people in low-rainfall areas of Brazil, in 2012  
Volkswagen joined with partners to install more than 300 
additional public water pumps. Volkswagen do Brasil has 
also assumed responsibility for managing the Popular 
Water Pump (PMP) programme. Under this project easy-
to-operate public water pumps are providing a free water 
supply in nine states. The number of such pumps has now 
been increased to around 1,000, meaning that in future 
140,000 people will benefit, most of them on low in-
comes.  
 135
In cases where water withdrawal is unavoidable, Volkswagen 
aims wherever possible to implement suitable offsetting 
measures. For example the state-of-the-art plant now being 
constructed in Ningbo, in southern China (annual produc-
tion capacity 300,000 vehicles), is sited in an industrial 
zone which was originally built on tidal flats. As early as the 
planning stage, Volkswagen therefore also investigated the 
scope for offsetting projects. The Company is now looking 
into ways and means of designating tidal mudflats on the 
Yellow Sea as protected areas.

BIODIvERsItY 
Biological diversity and the services performed by the 
world’s ecosystems are the very foundations of life and 
economic activity. Yet despite this universally acknowl-
edged truth, species, ecosystems and genetic diversity 
are in dramatic decline. 
The reasons for this are many and varied, but scientists 
cite the destruction of habitats, excessive development 
and the depletion of natural resources, overfertilisation, 
the introduction of non-native species, and increasingly, 
climate change as the principal culprits. Protecting biodi-
versity is therefore one of the most pressing challenges of 
our time. 
As an industrial company, Volkswagen is committed to  
the protection of biodiversity, primarily by reducing its 
greenhouse gas emissions and via conventional environ-
mental management practices designed to reduce and 
eliminate waste, exhaust air, wastewater or noise. Direct 
nature and species conservation measures in the envi-
ronment of our factories likewise play an important role, 
alongside the important issue of land use. 
Biodiversity management
Volkswagen’s commitment to the conservation of biodi-
versity includes implementing statutory guidelines and 
conventions, such as the International Convention on Bi-
ological Diversity (CBD) and the European and national 
biodiversity strategy of the German Government. Ever 
since the mission statement “Protecting Biological Diver-
sity” was first drafted in 2007, safeguarding biodiversity 
has been an explicit corporate goal of Volkswagen AG. In 
the reporting period, the Group was continuously advised 
by the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Un-
ion (NABU).  
 151
The Company was also involved in both the international 
Business & Biodiversity (B&B) initiative and the Biodiver-
sity project group of the econsense sustainability forum. 
As co-founder of the B&B initiative, Volkswagen donated 
€50,000 to this dedicated learning and dialogue platform 
for industry in 2012. At the same time, Volkswagen 
stepped up its efforts to incorporate species conservation 
into its factories’ environmental action plans, using the 
regular Regional Conferences staged by global Environ-
mental Management as a platform. The Company also 
shared details of its biodiversity policy with its partners 
on the B2B supplier platform www.vwgroupsupply.com. 
 152
Working together for biodiversity
Starting in 2010, in collaboration with partners from the 
worlds of research and insurance, Volkswagen made an as-
sessment of the ecological risks at its production sites. The 
aim was to analyse and grade emission risks (exhaust air, 
wastewater and waste) in respect of the potential damage 
to water, soil and biodiversity. Having analysed ten German 
Volkswagen and Audi plants in 2010, followed by the Osna-
brück, Brussels and Palmela plants in 2011, the process 
continued with the Leipzig, Zuffenhausen and Weissach 
plants in 2012. The 2012 assessment identified sites adja-
cent to areas of high biodiversity value (> p. 147). There 
were no known cases of Volkswagen’s activities endanger-
ing the natural habitats of species on the Red List of the In-
ternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natu-
ral Resources (IUCN) in 2012.
Volkswagen considers biodiversity aspects from the outset 
when considering potential new sites. For example, in 2012 
it examined potential biodiversity projects in the area sur-
rounding its new Changsha plant in the Chinese province 
of Hunan. In collaboration with the German development 
agency GIZ GmbH, it devised a range of project funding 
options to protect agricultural diversity. Volkswagen also 
commissioned a number of studies into potential projects 
to protect the tidal mudflats in the Yellow Sea as a compen-
satory measure.
Biodiversity reporting & communications
Reporting and communications on our activities to pro-
tect biodiversity have been extended and improved. In 
late 2012, the first progress report was posted on the web-
site of the B&B initiative. One year prior to this, the web-
site www.mobil-fuer-mensch-und-natur.de had gone live 
as an interactive platform for our collaboration with 
NABU. Furthermore, in May 2012, Volkswagen and econ-

The interactive exhibition “Tour de Wolf” by Volkswagen 
and NABU continued to make the rounds of wildlife parks 
and zoos, with wolf enclosures inviting visitors to a range 
of experience-based educational events (“Welcome Wolf”). 
The accompanying media competition “Wanted – Games, 
Apps, Clips” was designed to sensitise creative young peo-
ple to this topic. 
Having attended the previous two CBD Conferences, in Oc-
tober 2012 the Group once again sent a delegation to the 
11th CoP in the Indian city of Hyderabad. Volkswagen India 
had its own multimedia “ThinkBlue” stand at the confer-
ence, where it showcased a range of topical issues includ-
ing eco-friendly factories, water conservation, biogas, spe-
cies inventory, and environmental education.
Nature conservation and biodiversity projects 
Once again, a slew of projects for the conservation of na-
ture and species were initiated or continued at numerous 
locations, spearheaded by individual brands and regions 
in collaboration with local partners. The large-scale refor-
estation of the “Izta-Popo” mountain region in Mexico, for 
example, provides effective protection against soil erosion 
and allows the soil to store more precious groundwater  
(> p. 124). Meanwhile, Volkswagen de México’s “Por amor 
al planeta” (For love of the planet) project continued to sup-
port research into biodiversity and third-party projects fo-
cusing on the preservation of biodiversity. 
Volkswagen of South Africa became a sponsor-partner of 
the Wilderness Foundation’s Rhino Protection Initiative, 
and also supported the work of the Dyer Island Conserva-
tion Trust to protect dolphins and penguins. Extensive 
tree-planting efforts continued at numerous locations 
around the globe, including the USA, India, Spain, Brazil, 
South Africa and Germany. Additionally, Volkswagen do 
Brasil made the environmental education of its workforce 
a particular priority.
For a number of years, the Volkswagen Group China has 
collaborated with the Chinese Center for Environmental 
Education and Communication on the Green Future Envi-
ronmental Education Initiative, or GFEEI. In summer 
2012, the German Youth Association for the Protection of 
Nature (NAJU) visited the initiative to advise and educate 
the team in a hands-on way.
The flowering rush has spread from the Drömling reserve to the Aller 
river meadows near Wolfsburg, as a result of flooding. 
Volkswagen is supporting around 30 biodiversity projects, which are 
helping to protect species such as the tree frog.

While Volkswagen supported a European Union-funded 
species inventory in the Czech Republic’s national parks, 
Lamborghini launched another species diversity study in 
collaboration with universities in Bologna, Bolzano and 
Munich. The Group also provided (long-term) vehicle loans 
to a large number of nature conservation initiatives and as-
sociations, as well as scientific institutions and research 
organizations around the globe. 
In Germany too, Volkswagen has been busy promoting na-
ture and species conservation. A habitat networking proj-
ect, funded by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation 
under the Federal Programme for Biological Diversity and 
initiated by the German Campaign for Otter Protection (Ak-
tion Fischotterschutz e.V.) in collaboration with Volkswagen, 
was launched in late 2012 along the river Aller. Volks-
wagen is also supporting the renaturation of the Lower 
Havel, Europe’s largest river renaturation project, and 
has contributed in various ways, including a major cam-
paign to collect unwanted mobile phones at its Wolfsburg, 
Emden and Hanover factories, the proceeds from which 
were donated to the initiative. These two projects, which 
are carefully monitored by experts from the participating 
project partners, are renaturing large areas of river land-
scape – inluding 100 kilometres of river bank on the Low-
er Havel.  
 154, 155
Alongside water pollution control, growing importance is 
also attached to moorland conservation. The joint envi-
ronmental programme developed by Volkswagen Leasing 
GmbH and NABU is a particularly effective tool in moor-
land conservation, and enabled NABU to rehydrate both 
the Theikenmeer region of Emsland (240 hectares) and 
the Grosses Moor region in south-east Lower Saxony 
(2,720 hectares), followed in mid-2012 by the Lichten-
moor region near Nienburg/Weser (13 hectares). This has 
helped to preserve a number of carbon sinks and biotopes 
for endangered species of fauna and flora, including the 
European viper, common lizard, large blue butterfly, Eu-
ropean golden plover, sundew and hare’s-tail cotton-
grass. Without hydration, some 180,000 tonnes of CO₂ 
would be released as a result of oxidation in the next 20 
years in the Lichtenmoor region alone. Volkswagen Leas-
ing GmbH also set up the German Moorland Protection 
Fund with initial funding of €1.6 million, which it hopes 
will help attract additional donations. In collaboration 
with NABU, Volkswagen also embarked upon a feasibility 
study to explore renaturation options for Russian moor-
lands in the Nizhniy Novgorod region.  
 23
Finally, in Lower Saxony, the Company also renewed its 
commitment to a wild cat project by the environmental 
protection and nature conservation association Bund für 
Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND), which is 
creating habitat corridors for this endangered species.
For the fifth year running, the Audi Environmental Foun-
dation has joined with the Technical University of Munich 
to support the Oak Forest project near Audi’s headquar-
ters in Ingolstadt. The aim of the project is to plant trees 
and research optimum growing conditions for them. In 
the southern German town of Breitengüßbach, Audi sup-
ported the local environmental centre and opened a “Na-
ture Classroom” on a 125 hectare site, where visitors can 
experience local nature and biodiversity. Meanwhile, 
Audi in Berlin supported a reaction kinetics project on 
older city trees, also run by the Technical University of 
Munich. The Audi Environmental Foundation also fund-
ed a bionics competition for school classes, and a project 
to promote bee-keeping in schools.

AWARDs
In 2012, Volkswagen once again received a slew of envi-
ronmental and sustainability awards from independent 
organisations and media around the globe. 
Yellow Angel
Each year, the German motoring organisation ADAC 
awards one of the automotive industry’s most prestigious 
prizes – the Yellow Angel (Gelber Engel). The natural gas-
powered Volkswagen Passat TSI EcoFuel won an award in 
the “Car of the Future” category, primarily in recognition 
of its low-emission powertrain. The new multicollision 
brake system developed by Volkswagen, which can help to 
prevent secondary collisions following an accident, was 
likewise awarded a Yellow Angel, winning the special prize 
in the “Innovation and Environment” category. 
Ethics in Business Award
The World Forum for Ethics in Business awarded Volks-
wagen the Ethics in Business Award 2012 in the Outstand-
ing Corporation category, for its extensive activities in the 
field of sustainability and corporate social responsibility. 
As well as praising Volkswagen’s ongoing efforts in the 
fields of environmental management and social engage-
ment, the jury also recognised Volkswagen’s inclusion in 
the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and its third-
place listing in the Sustainalytics DAX 30 Rating. 
VCD Environmental Car List
The Transport Association Germany (VCD) publishes an 
annual ranking of the most climate-friendly cars on the 
market, and has crowned the Volkswagen brand’s natural 
gas-powered eco up! as the overall winner for 2012/2013. As 
well as winning the top spot in the overall ranking, the eco 
up! also scored highest in the “Klimabesten” (“Best Air”) 
category. The key deciding factors are pollutant emissions, 
fuel consumption and noise. With consumption of just 2.9 
kilograms of natural gas per 100 kilometres, the eco up! 
sets new standards. Alongside the eco up!, the Touran TSI 
EcoFuel, likewise powered by natural gas, was awarded 
second place in the 7-seater category, with CO₂ emissions 
Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Management of the Volkswagen brand responsible for Development (right), stepped up to re-
ceive the award for the Volkswagen Golf in the Compact Car category (on the left is Jens Katemann, Editor-in-Chief, “auto motor und sport”).

of 128 g/km. Other Volkswagen brand models also scored 
highly in other categories. As a manufacturer, Volkswagen 
was ranked in second place for its environmental commit-
ment. The jury analysed production processes, studied en-
vironmental and sustainability reports, and considered 
the company’s commitment to more efficient environmen-
tal technology in its vehicles. 
Five stars in NCAP test
The new Volkswagen Golf was awarded the top five-star 
ranking by the European consumer protection organisa-
tion Euro NCAP. It also won the Euro NCAP Advanced 
Award for innovations in integral safety, one of which was 
the new multicollision brake. 
Green Truck
The Scania R480 Euro 6 was rated the most environmen-
tally compatible commercial vehicle in the heavy semitrail-
er tractor category by trade magazines “Verkehrsrund-
schau” and “Trucker”, who awarded it the title of “Green 
Truck 2012”. Alongside fuel consumption and related CO₂ 
emissions, the decision also took into account the EURO 
emissions class and other factors such as the maximum 
payload, and was based on extensive vehicle testing.

Institute at Duisburg-Essen University. The jury praised the 
electric delivery vehicle for its manoeuvrability and space-
saving design, as well as its state-of-the-art data and power-
train technology that makes for eco-compatible transporta-
tion with very low CO₂ emissions. 
Green Car of the Year
The Gol Ecomotion and the Polo BlueMotion were named 
“Green Car of the Year” by the Brazilian magazine “Auto 
Esporte”, winning one of the most prestigious automotive 
prizes in Brazil. The Gol is a compact car developed espe-
cially for the Latin American market following discontin-
uation of the legendary Beetle, and enjoys growing popu-
larity. 
A list of other environment-related awards from the report-
ing period is available online. Alongside the examples of 
environmental prizes listed here, Volkswagen also won nu-
merous other awards for customer satisfaction, design, 
safety, equipment levels and vehicle performance. Details 
can be found on the websites of the respective brands. In 
2012 the Volkswagen brand also created its own award gal-
lery on its website.

The “Think Blue. Factory.” programme 
is a management approach that system-
atically builds on the successful “Think 
Blue.” philosophy, Volkswagen’s holistic 
approach to ecological sustainability. 
Integrating both ecological and eco-
nomic objectives, it aims to reduce the 
environmental impacts from the Volks-
wagen brand’s production operations by 
25 percent per vehicle by 2018. 
To achieve this ambitious goal, the exist-
ing plants have begun a systematic “Think 
Blue. Factory.” process which is setting 
them on the road to greener production. 
The key tool in this process is know-how. 
Consequently, Volkswagen plants are 
pooling their experience in the field of in-
novative production technologies to create 
a body of know-how which can be used 
across the whole organisation. 
To assist with this process, all plants have 
been equipped with the “Think Blue. Fac-
tory.” toolkit. This set of methods and tools 
allows each plant to develop a “migration 
path” for achieving its own particular sus-
tainability objectives. The most important 
tool is the standardised “Think Blue. Fac-
tory.” catalogue of actions and measures. 
This comprises a range of plant and pro-
cess improvement measures covering all 
production sectors and functions. These 
measures are supplemented by improve-
ment actions for building- and utility-re-
lated infrastructures.
The catalogue provides a pool of infor-
mation about new Volkswagen produc-
tion technologies. All measures in this 
catalogue are recommended for wider 
adoption across the plants. Further in-
novations and new developments from 
the plants are being added to the cata-
logue all the time. To monitor progress, 
the improvement drive is continuously 
tracked using the five key indicators en-
ergy, water, waste, carbon dioxide and 
solvent emissions. 
Energy consumption
Across all categories of energy con-
sumption, from electrical power for pro-
duction machinery to natural gas for 
space heating, Volkswagen identifies  
opportunities for savings and exploits 
these opportunities using efficient tech-
nologies. One example is the introduc-
tion of new boiler plants at the Wolfs-
burg site, which have reduced district 
heating consumption by 18,400 mega-
watt-hours and electricity consumption 
by 4,200 megawatt-hours annually.
Water consumption
Wherever water is taken from – on-site 
wells, rainwater or other sources – an 
ever increasing proportion of it is being 
recovered and reused. Meanwhile, over-
all consumption of water by production 
processes is being steadily reduced. For 
example, freshwater consumption for 
paint overspray separation at new plants 
has been reduced to zero by using dry 
overspray separation systems instead of 
conventional wet scrubbing. 
“Think Blue. Factory.”
Waste for disposal
Waste avoidance is a top priority at  
Volkswagen. Treatment and reuse of con-
taminated rinsing thinners at the paint-
shop in Osnabrück is just one example. 
This paintshop also reuses recycled PVC. 
And at the Bratislava plant, a comprehen-
sive system for optimised waste manage-
ment has been developed that will be tak-
en up by all plants in future. Production 
waste, packaging waste and workshop 
waste at Volkswagen is recycled.
CO2 emissions
Volkswagen reduces CO2 emissions at 
source – for example by using climate-
friendly renewable energy sources such 
as wind, solar and hydroelectric power. 
Recently added renewable energy facili-
ties include a new solar facility in Chat-
tanooga (USA) and the Anhanguera hy-
droelectric power plant in Brazil. In 
2012, Volkswagen decided to build a 
second hydroelectric power plant in 
Brazil, near São Paulo. This will allow 
Volkswagen to meet 94 percent of its lo-
cal energy needs from green power. And 
since December 2011, hydroelectric 
power has been supplying 100 percent 
of electricity requirements at the engine 
plant in Polkowice, Poland. At the same 
time, further reductions in CO2 emis-
sions are being achieved with the aid of 
optimised plant and equipment. For ex-
ample, new production systems are now 
fitted with more efficient hydraulic 
pumps.
solvent emissions
Volkswagen’s paintshops are equipped 
with innovative waste air treatment sys-
tems. New technologies are also reduc-
ing consumption of rinsing agents. At 
the Pamplona plant in Spain, for exam-
ple, materials utilisation for adhesives 
has been improved to 100 percent 
thanks to the “Think Blue. Factory.” 
programme. As a result, at this one 
plant alone, hazardous waste and sol-
vents for disposal have been reduced by 
five tonnes annually. 
As the indicators show, in recent months 
the “Think Blue. Factory.” programme 
has made significant progress in reduc-
ing environmental impacts. For example, 
at the Braunschweig components plant 
alone, heating energy consumption in 
production shops has been reduced by 
630 MWh annually, thanks to optimised 
deployment of air curtain systems and 
high-speed doors. Controlled ventilation 
systems at the Kaluga plant in Russia have 
also improved energy efficiency. And at 
the Salzgitter plant, heat recovery from 
compressed air systems is delivering an-
nual energy savings of 7,300 megawatt-
hours. Finally, Volkswagen has upgraded 
the ventilation systems at the Wolfsburg 
plant with state-of-the-art filters in a 
measure that will reduce CO2 emissions 
by approximately 2,000 tonnes per year. 
Extensive communication and informa-
tion is helping to raise the employee 
awareness of “Think Blue. Factory.” As 
more employees become involved, the 
process becomes more energised and 
dynamic. This is reflected in a flood of 
improvement suggestions submitted by 
employees as well as in record participa-
tion in the ideas management system in 
2012. The Energy Cup for employees 
and the Internal Environmental Award, 
which in 2012 was presented to the 
Pamplona (Spain), Pune (India), Wolfs-
burg (Germany), and Polkowice (Poland) 
sites, are further ways in which Volks-
wagen is motivating employees to devel-
op eco-friendly initiatives. 
“Think Blue. Factory.” also includes reg-
ular Volkswagen-wide practice-sharing 
meetings. For example, the “Think Blue. 
Factory.” Day 2012 in Wolfsburg brought 
together 350 energy and environment 
experts from all plants. This cross-site 
opportunity for networking and best-
practice sharing sets the “Think Blue. 
Factory.” concept on an ever-broader 
base, giving the plants a growing cata-
logue of measures from which to com-
pile their individual roadmaps. In this 
way, and step by step, “Think Blue. Fac-
tory.” is smoothing the way to making 
Volkswagen’s production operations 25 
percent more environmentally compati-
ble by 2018. 
“Think Blue. Factory.” has already re-
ceived widespread acclaim. For exam-
ple, in 2012, Volkswagen was presented 
with the Sustainovation Award for best 
sustainability programme.

Volkswagen’s biggest solar power 
plant worldwide meets roughly 12.5 
percent of energy requirements. Some

A heat exchanger in the chimney is used 
to recover energy from waste heat. This 
has almost halved boiler-room operating 
hours and reduced gas consumption and 
CO₂ emissions by around five percent. The 
monthly saving is around €15,000, which 
means the innovation paid for itself in 
just a year.

power plants. This saves 100% of the CO₂ 
emissions. The factory was awarded the 
internal Energy Cup for the lowest base 
load. The target: 80 kilowatt-hours per  
engine produced.      
Hydro-power plants
Polkowice (Poland)
Installing frequency converters has  
resulted in more efficient operation of 
large fans for ventilating factory build-
ings and offices. Each ventilator now 
saves some 300 megawatt-hours of 
energy per year – enough energy for 
about 100 four-person households.  
Ventilation  
Braunschweig (Germany)
Instead of expensive refurbishment of 
long pipelines for transporting hot water 
from the south power station to build-
ings 9 and 26, boiler rooms were built 
where they were needed. This prevents 
heat losses in transit – saving 18,369 
megawatt-hours of district heating and 
35 percent CO₂ per year.    
Paintshop  
Wolfsburg (Germany)
The heat arising from compressed-air 
production is used to preheat the fresh-
air supply. This cuts heating costs. About 
7,300 megawatt-hours of heat energy are 
recovered every year – enough to heat 
roughly 400 detached houses for a year.

Social indicators
Volkswagen’s workforce is constantly growing. As at 31 De-
cember 2012, the Volkswagen Group, including the Chinese 
joint ventures, had 549,763 employees, 9.5% more than at 
the end of the 2011 financial year (501,956 employees). 
Major factors behind this increase, apart from growth in 
volume, were the consolidation of Porsche with 17,502 em-
ployees and of the motorcycle manufacturer Ducati with 
1,197 employees. As a result, there has been a slight shift in 
the distribution of Group employees between Germany and 
abroad: while at the end of 2011 44.8% of staff worked in 
Germany, this proportion was 45.4% at 31 December 2012.

One of the Company’s goals is to continue to increase the proportion 
of women from 15.2% across the Group, especially in management. In 
the year under review, the proportion of women in management roles 
in the Volkswagen Group in Germany was already increased to 5.5% 
among senior executives, to 7.0% in senior management and to 11.0% 
in management (situation at year-end, excl. Scania, MAN and Porsche).
The annual employee opinion survey, introduced in 2008, is an established standardised Group-wide tool designed to assess employee  
satisfaction, eliminate errors and improve work processes. Its acceptance and level of participation are growing year by year. The employee 
satisfaction index reflects the level of satisfaction as a weighted average of the 11 statements rated across the Group. The scale of the  
index extends from zero to 100.

Since 2008, the average age at 
Volkswagen AG has been rela-
tively constant, which is a sign 
of a healthy balance between 
recruitment of employees on 
completion of their training 
and retirement of long-serving 
employees.
The chart shows the age 
structure of employees in 
the Volkswagen Group. The 
average age of Group em-
ployees is 38.4 years, while 
the average age of the 
Volkswagen AG workforce 
is 42.6 years, the average 
for female employees being 
38.0 years and that for

Low absenteeism calls for increased availability of diagnostic and  
preventive measures. Absenteeism is calculated using the formula: 
number of days lost to illness or accident multiplied by 100, divided 
by total possible days’ attendance in the relevant period

The employee turnover rate indicates the percentage of employees 
that leave the Company in the course of a year. As the chart shows, 
there is a very high level of stability in Volkswagen’s workforce.
The accident frequency index is an indication of the frequency with 
which accidents at work occurred in relation to the total number of 
hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is: number of  
occupational accidents, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number 
of hours worked.
The accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents are  
by relating the total number of working days lost to the number of 
hours worked. In this case, the formula for calculating the index is: 
number of working days lost, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the 
number of hours worked multiplied by ten. 
Information on occupational safety training measures: 
 65
From one year to the next, Volkswagen continues to enhance occupa- 
tional safety across the Group. As is clear from the accident frequency  
index, the number of accidents is falling continuously. This is mainly  
attributable to a more systematic approach to and continuous improve-
ment in occupational safety at the Group’s plants. Accident severity in 
the Volkswagen Group has also declined since 2006. Since then, only one 
Volkswagen AG employee has died, in 2011, as the result of an occupa- 
tional accident. The greatest improvements in accident frequency were 
achieved at Volkswagen Slovakia in Martin, Volkswagen do Brasil in  
Taubaté, Volkswagen Motor Polska in Polkovice, Volkswagen AG in Kassel, 
Volkswagen Argentina in Pacheco and Volkswagen do Brasil in Curitiba.

Environmental indicators
This section presents selected environmental data for the 
Volkswagen Group in aggregated form. The data are col-
lected, checked and approved at the individual production 
plants on the basis of an internal standard (VW standard 
98 000). The environmental data come from production 
plants with a total workforce of around 450,000 (as of 31 De-
cember 2012); figures for Porsche AG are included from 1 
August 2012 onwards. As in Volkswagen’s Annual Report, 
the data are shown for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.
The absolute figures include all production sites, plus the 
power stations and boiler plants operated by Volkswagen 
AG at Wolfsburg, Kassel and Hanover. The proportions due 
to cars and light commercial vehicles are shown as solid 
bars, while those due to other parts of the Group (MAN SE, 
Scania AB and power stations and boiler plants operated 
by Volkswagen AG) are cross-hatched.
The Volkswagen Group is first and foremost a car manufac-
turer. Apart from heavy goods vehicles and buses, we pri-
marily produce cars and light commercial vehicles in quan-
tities that have steadily increased over the years. However, 
the inclusion of MAN SE saw the addition of marine engines 
and entire power plants to our product portfolio. For this 
reason the overall environmental impacts cannot be consid-
ered simply in relation to the number of vehicles produced. 
This report therefore introduces the use of relative indica-
tors for the category “cars and light commercial vehicles”. In 
future the aim is to show vehicle-related impacts for the 
“trucks and buses” category as well, when the necessary 
data collection methods are available. 
The indicators for calendar year 2012 that have been au-
dited by PricewaterhouseCoopers are marked with the 
following symbol .
Despite increased production volumes and the inclusion of new production plants, with an associated increase in energy consumption, direct CO₂ emis-
sions have been falling since 2010. Resource-optimised manufacturing processes, climatic influences and changes in the quality of the supplied energy 
sources have a positive impact on CO₂ emissions.

The increase in energy and heat consumption and in the consumption of fuel gases for manufacturing processes is associated with the continuous in-
crease in production over the reporting period. Heat consumption, being the sum of space heat and industrial heat, is subject to variation due to cli-
matic and manufacturing conditions. In relation to the number of vehicles produced, consumption of heat and electricity – one of the largest sources 
of CO₂ emissions – was down thanks to the Group’s resource conservation strategy. The same also applies to fuel gas consumption per vehicle produced.

As a result of increased consumption of electricity and heat, overall CO₂ emissions have risen. Greater use of renewably generated energy did, 
however, limit the increase in CO₂ emissions. The CO₂ emissions produced by power stations and boiler plants operated by Volkswagen AG as a 
result of power and heat generation for Volkswagen AG production plants are included with suitable CO₂ emission factors in the total quantity 
of CO₂ emissions. The stated carbon dioxide emissions do not include the emissions arising from district heating and power supplied to third 
parties from power stations operated by Volkswagen AG.

GROUP EMIssIONs (sCOPE 3)
The 2012 Sustainability Report is the first 
time that the Volkswagen Group has pub-
lished a Scope 3 inventory for CO₂ emissions. 
In line with the WBCSD/WRI Scope 3 stand-
ard published in 2011, Volkswagen is report-
ing CO₂ emissions for 12 out of a total of  
15 Scope 3 categories. The calculations have  
revealed that the “purchased goods and ser-
vices” and “use phase” emission categories 
account for over 93% of all Scope 3 emis-
sions. These categories were therefore  
additionally validated and verified by  
external auditors from TÜV NORD in accord-
ance with the internationally recognised  
ISO 14064-3 standard.

As a result of the increase in vehicle production over the reporting period and the associated higher paint consumption, there was an increase 
in VOC emissions. Between 2010 and 2012, however, there was a downturn in the specific values per vehicle.

As a result of increased production across the Group and the introduction of new models, metallic waste volumes rose over the total reporting period. 
The reduction in this kind of waste per vehicle is attributable to improved material utilisation and resource-optimised manufacturing processes. Over 
the entire reporting period, there was an improvement in waste for disposal per vehicle, while waste volumes for recycling per vehicle rose slightly.

* In the bar “non-hazardous waste for recycling” the proportion relating to other Group divisions is cross-hatched as in the past, while in the other 
fractions this proportion is too small to be marked separately. 
Due to the inclusion of new production plants, water consumption and wastewater volumes rose over the reporting period. Increased produc-
tion across the Group also contributed to this increase. At many plants, water consumption has basically dropped relative to the volume of ve-
hicles produced thanks to the Volkswagen Group’s resource conservation strategy. This is also reflected in the wastewater volumes per vehicle.

Audi balanced mobility: vision for CO₂-neutral 
mobility
The Audi e-gas project makes use of environ- 
mentally friendly renewable energy sources for 
producing fuels for various environmentally friendly 
powertrain technologies. Power generated by four 
offshore wind turbines in the North Sea is used to 
produce e-gas, a CO₂-neutral, artificial methane gas. 
It can be fed into the natural gas grid and thus be 
used to power the A3 TCNG fleet. The 1.4 TFSI, 
specially adapted for use with natural gas, is the 
basic engine for the A3 TCNG. Project: e-gas using 
A3 TCNG by way of example (2nd prize in the 2011 
“Grüne lenkrad” awards for environmental 
technology)

volkswagen opens up perspectives for specialists from 
southern Europe
The Volkswagen Group is now offering a new programme 
for young people from Southern Europe, offering them an 
opportunity to kick-start a career with Europe’s largest  
automaker. The “StartUp Europe” trainee programme is  
tailor-made for engineers wanting to gain international 
experience after obtaining their degree.
volkswagen Group adopts Charter on temporary Work
The Group Board of Management, the European Group 
Works Council and the Global Group Works Council of 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft have adopted a “Charter 
on Temporary Work for the Volkswagen Group”. The char-
ter lays down the principles for the use of temporary work 
throughout the Volkswagen Group. The points covered in-
clude ensuring appropriate employment and remunera-
tion conditions for temporary external personnel.
stiftung Warentest gives Quicar top rating 
Volkswagen’s Quicar car-sharing service has been awarded 
a top rating of 1.8 by consumer organisation Stiftung 
Warentest. Nine car-sharing firms from Germany and the 
Netherlands were assessed, with test winner Quicar pre-
senting a compelling case to the experts in categories in-
cluding booking, driving and online presence.
 
sustainovation Award
The environmental programme “Think Blue. Factory.” has 
been presented with the “Sustainovation Award 2012 by 
German business magazine WirtschaftsWoche and the Al-
tran Foundation for Innovation. Volkswagen has a clear ob-
jective with this international initiative: to improve key envi-
ronmental performance figures. The aim is to achieve a 25 
percent reduction in levels of energy consumption, waste, 
water consumption, CO2 and solvent emissions by 2018.
Presentation of the new Golf
Volkswagen celebrated the world premiere of the new Golf 
in Berlin on September 4. The seventh generation of the 
VW model is the best Golf ever built. Across the entire en-
gine range, Volkswagen has managed to reduce CO2 emis-
sions from the new Golf by an average of around 14 per-
cent.
Gelber Engel
Volkswagen won the 2013 Gelber Engel (“Yellow Angel”) 
award from German automobile club ADAC in the “Inno-
vation and Environment” category in recognition of its ef-
ficient three-cylinder natural gas engine. 
Winning support for “A chance to play” project 
Volkswagen is donating €2 million to support disadvan-
taged children and young people in Brazil. “A chance to 
play”, launched to coincide with the football World Cup 
2010 in South Africa by Volkswagen Group Works Council 
and children’s rights organisation “terre des hommes”, 
strives to improve the lives of impoverished children at 
Volkswagen locations around the world. In the run-up to 
the 2014 World Cup, the initiative will now be supporting 14 
projects targeting child poverty in host country Brazil, 
reaching out to 60,000 children.

Lowlights
Poor performance in CsR Online Awards
The CSR Online Awards presented by Lundquist reflect 
the Milan-based communications consultancy’s analysis 
of sustainability reporting by large companies on the In-
ternet. In 2012 the lion’s share of companies failed to do 
justice to the possibilities offered by the medium with 
their static communications approaches. Volkswagen was 
among those who slipped down the rankings – from 51st 
(2011) to 93rd (2012).  
Greenpeace protest
Environmental organisation Greenpeace staged various 
protests during the reporting year – e.g. at the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting in Hamburg, the presentation of the new Golf 
in Berlin’s Nationalgalerie and the Paris Motor Show. 
Greenpeace accuses Volkswagen of bringing vehicles onto 
the market with excessive fuel consumption and thus CO2 
emissions – and therefore failing to meet its responsibili-
ties with regard to environmental protection.*
Weak start for home power plants
The “home power plant” is a Volkswagen EcoBlue natural 
gas-powered cogeneration plant produced by the Group ex-
clusively for LichtBlick. It produces combined heat and 
power for private homes. In 2011 Volkswagen and LichtBlick 
set themselves a goal of installing around 100,000 such fa-
cilities within Germany. In 2012 it became clear that this 
aim was far too ambitious. 
“auto motor und sport” reports negative trend in “eco-
compatible cars” category
Since 2010 the Volkswagen brand has seen its image suffer 
in the “makes eco-compatible cars“ category of “auto mo-
tor und sport” magazine’s annual appraisal – despite its 
use of innovative, fuel economy-enhancing and low-emis-
sion technologies. Volkswagen currently ranks only third, 
behind Toyota and BMW.
transparency International criticises sustainability report-
ing of German companies 
The anti-corruption organisation Transparency Interna-
tional Deutschland (TI) has criticised the sustainability re-
ports issued by German companies for failing to deliver on 
their promises in the fight against corruption. According 
to Transparency International, the information given in 
the sustainability reports of many German car makers did 
not fully satisfy the requirements of the GRI indicator pro-
tocols for the four GRI core indicators examined by TI. 
Volkswagen was one of the companies cited.

 * Following the Geneva Motor Show, Volkswagen and Greenpeace signed a joint statement on the 95 g/km goal adopted by Volkswagen. 
In this statement, Volkswagen and the independent environmental protection organisation agree to maintain an ongoing process of 
constructive dialogue.

Independent Assurance Report
To Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg
We have been engaged by Volkswagen AG to perform an inde-
pendent assurance engagement to attain moderate assurance 
1 in respect of observing the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 
and regarding individual quantitative sustainability data se-
lected by Volkswagen AG in the Sustainability Report 2012 of 
Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg.
Responsibility of the legal representatives
It is the responsibility of the legal representatives of the Com-
pany
• to comply with the principles of inclusivity, materiality and 
responsiveness as defined in the AccountAbility Principles 
Standard (2008) (the “AA1000 AccountAbility Principles”), 
and
• to prepare the sustainability information in the Sustainabil-
ity Report 2012 in accordance with the criteria set out in the 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (pages 7 to 17) of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the conception, implementa-
tion and maintenance of systems and processes for ensuring 
compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and 
the preparation of the Sustainability Report 2012 using as-
sumptions and estimations that are appropriate under the 
given circumstances.
Responsibility of the auditor
Our responsibility is to form an opinion, based on our assur-
ance procedures, on whether facts have come to our attention 
which would lead us to assume that in all material respects
•  the systems and processes installed by the Company are not 
appropriate for compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility 
Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness; or
•  the selected quantitative sustainability information set out 
in the Sustainability Report 2012 has not been prepared in 
compliance with the criteria set out in the Sustainability Re-
porting Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (p. 7 to p.17) of the Global Report-
ing Initiative (GRI).
The individual quantitative sustainability information select-
ed by Volkswagen AG for calendar year 2012, which is included 
in our engagement, can be found on pages 136 to 147 of the 
Sustainability Report 2012, excluding the Employee Opinion 
Survey in the Volkswagen Group, Scope, 3-Emissions Group, 
Particles Emission, Water Consumption according to Sources 
and Sites in the Proximity of Protection Areas. The indicators 
for calendar year 2012, which we audited, are marked sepa-
rately with the following symbol .
We were also engaged to provide recommendations for the fur-
ther development of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Management and CSR Reporting on the basis of the results of 
our independent assurance engagement.
We conducted our independent assurance engagement in ac-
cordance with AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS) 2008 
and also in accordance with the International Standard on As-
surance Engagements (ISAE) 3000.
These standards require that we fulfill our professional duties 
and plan and conduct the engagement in accordance with the 
principle of materiality so that we can form an opinion with 
moderate assurance,1 which is the degree of assurance that was 
required by Volkswagen AG. We are independent, as defined by 
Section 3.2 of AA1000AS (2008).
Due to our expertise and experience in auditing non-financial 
information, sustainability management and social and eco-
logical issues, we have the competencies required to conduct 
this independent assurance engagement.
An independent assurance engagement performed to obtain 
moderate assurance1 is less substantial in scope than an inde-
pendent assurance engagement performed to obtain high as-
surance2, with the result that a corresponding lower level of as-
surance is obtained. The audit activities to be performed are 
selected by the auditor after a due assessment of the circum-
stances.
With regard to compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility 
Principles, our examination procedures included the follow-
ing:
• Discussions with management
• Gaining an understanding of the relevant systems and pro-
cesses and comprehension of relevant documentation
• Random sampling to obtain evidence of the implementation 
and appropriateness of the relevant systems and processes
With regard to the selected sustainability information in the 
Sustainability Report, our work included the following exami-
nations, inter alia:
• Discussions with the employees responsible for the report-
ing of sustainability information
• Examination of the systems and processes for the compila-
tion, calculation and reporting of sustainability information
• Functional examination of the controls respecting the assur-
ance of data quality
• Analytical assessment of selected sustainability data
Depending on the selected sustainability information, vari-
ous audit activities are performed at Group, brand and plant 
level:
 1“Moderate assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “limited assurance” as specified by ISAe 3000. 
 2“High assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “reasonable assurance” as specified by ISAe 3000.

Material findings and judgments
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle 
of Inclusivity:
• Internal documentation and publicly accessible informa-
tion provide evidence of the identification and analysis of 
significant internal and external stakeholder expectations.
• Independent stakeholder management systems are devel-
oped by individual brands.
• Involvement of management in the results of stakeholder 
processes at Group level is ensured.
• Formal requirements for stakeholder management have not 
yet been defined at Group-wide level.
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle 
of materiality:
• The process to determine the materiality of sustainability is-
sues is based on adequate criteria and has been established.
• The identified relevant topics are prioritized within the 
scope of sustainability reporting.
• The inclusion of brands and regions in the materiality pro-
cess is not uniform.
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle 
of responsiveness:
• Volkswagen AG has established procedures for responding 
to sustainability issues that are important to stakeholders.
• The brands and regions as well as individual companies of 
the Volkswagen Group sometimes do not have systematic 
procedures for standardized response to stakeholder in-
quiries.
On the basis of our moderate assurance engagement to obtain a 
moderate degree of assurance, nothing has come to our atten-
tion that causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the 
systems and processes implemented by the Company are not 
suitable for observing the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of 
inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness.
Furthermore, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that, in all material respects, the selected quantitative 
sustainability information of the Sustainability Report has not 
been prepared in accordance with the above-mentioned crite-
ria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.0 (p. 7 to p. 
17) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
Recommendations
Without qualifying our audit opinions stated above, we make 
the following recommendations concerning further develop-
ment of stakeholder management, sustainability manage-
ment and sustainability reporting:
Recommendations regarding stakeholder management:
• A higher-level framework (e.g. guideline) should be estab-
lished with the aim further developing the steering and 
monitoring of Group-wide stakeholder activities.
• Ensuring consistent handling of stakeholder concerns 
Group-wide is just as necessary as the establishment of esca-
lation mechanisms regarding potentially critical issues.
• Documentation requirements regarding stakeholder man-
agement should be standardized.
In addition, we recommend:
• Company’s dynamic and globality should take into account 
the continuous further development of the Group-wide sus-
tainability management.
• Systematization of significant aspects of sustainability man-
agement concerning all brands and regions should be pro-
moted Group-wide.
• Systematic and continuous integration of sustainability as-
pects in the core processes of the Company.
• Successive and Group-wide further development of the 
steering system as well as improvement of existing process 
and control mechanisms regarding internal reporting on 
sustainability data.
• Further Group-wide automation of data consolidation, e.g. 
through use of a higher-level IT system for the reporting of 
sustainability data.
• Continuous and systematic further development of the tar-
get and measures catalogue and systematic implementation 
of same.

INTRODUCTION
PROf. DR. MARTIN WINTERKORN
Chairman of the Board of Management of 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft 
BERND OSTERLOh
Chairman of the General and  
Group Works Councils
Dear Reader,
The Volkswagen Group can look back on a successful year. Despite 
difficult market conditions our Company remained on course, 
combining quantitative growth with greater quality, as evidenced 
by the 9.73 million vehicles we delivered to customers around the 
world – a new record figure. Further proof is provided by the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index, where our Group was ranked in first 
place. Through these and many other success stories we have 
again made good progress towards becoming the world’s best and 
most sustainable automaker by 2018. 
What is it that sets us apart? We focus on providing an unparal-
leled diversity of powertrains, operating resource-efficient pro-
duction plants and offering good, secure jobs. Last year we invest-
ed more than €10 billion in research and development alone, 
reflecting the ambitious nature of the goals we are pursuing. 
Volkswagen is the first automobile manufacturer to commit to 
reducing the average CO2 emissions of its European new vehicle 
fleet to 95 g/km by 2020. We have already made substantial pro-
gress en route to this goal and last year for the first time brought 
the figure below 130 g/km. In addition, with the e-up!•, e-Golf •, 
Audi A3 e-tron• and Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid• we further 
 underpinned our claim to technology leadership in the field of 
 electric mobility.
At the same time, in our plants around the world we are striving 
to make our operations 25% more environmentally compatible 
and resource-efficient by 2018. These efforts are documented  
by the seven production plants inaugurated in 2013 in China, 
Russia and Mexico, all of which comply with the highest environ-
mental standards. 
Last but not least, in the past year we created more than 23,000 
new jobs. In all, we employ over 570,000 people. The number of 
young people in vocational training at our facilities around the 
world rose to 17,700. The Volkswagen Group has already estab-
lished the proven model of dual vocational education and training 
at 40 sites  in countries including Russia, the USA, India, Brazil 
and China.  And for us, sustainability always includes a social di-
mension, which is why we set the highest standards for the work-
ing conditions and inclusion of our employees. 
Why do we do all this? Because as a major automobile manufac-
turer we take seriously our responsibility for the sustainable 
 development of the economy, the environment and society. Our 
aim is to create lasting value – for the Company, its employees 
and its shareholders, but also for the countries and regions in 
which we ope rate. This all-embracing view of sustainability is 
shared by all twelve brands, our companies and all our emplo y-
ees across the Group.
The fact that we unite such a great diversity of cultures, competen-
cies and technical solutions makes us strong. And we are aiming to 
put these valuable assets to even better use by further intensifying 
the process of knowledge transfer within the Group. This will 
enable us to develop the right solutions for the challenges of  
the future – and make no mistake, those challenges are sub-
stantial. Markets are shifting, resources are becoming scarcer, 
emissions regulations are tightening up all over the world, and 
bo o ming cities call for new and intelligent traffic and mobility 
concepts. We consider it part of our responsibility to find the 
right answers to these trends. 
So how do we promote sustainability in concrete terms? This re-
port provides the answer, illustrated by numerous examples from 
the world of Volkswagen as well as by facts and figures. To make 
our report transparent, verifiable and comparable, we have taken 
our lead from the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI). The report also constitutes our Communication on Pro-
gress to the United Nations Global Compact, which we joined 
with a promise to uphold human rights, promote good working 
conditions and environmental protection worldwide, and com-
bat corruption. Since 2013 we have extended our engagement by 
also endorsing the Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate.
We invite you to familiarize yourself more closely with the diversity 
an d internationality of the Volkswagen Group and with our contri-
bution to sustainable development and hope you find this report 
makes inspiring reading.

In 2013 alone, the Volkswagen Group opened seven new pro­
duction plants around the world. The new facilities meet high 
environ mental standards and have adopted the dual model of 
 vocational training for their employees. They also set high social 
standards  in other respects. Through its commitment to the 
U nited Nations Global Compact, the Volkswagen Group has given 
a worldwide  undertaking to uphold human rights, foster good 
working con ditions, protect the environment and combat cor­
ruption. This  applies to our business relations but above all at  our 
production plants. In the regions in which we operate, we aim to  
be an attractive employer, a respected business partner and a good 
corporate citizen. You  will find a list of plant certifications on the 
Internet:

The number of production plants is greater than the number of 
sites because some sites host more than one plant.
GROUP PRODUCTION 
PLANTS
With its new components plant in Foshan, China, in December 2013 the Volkswagen Group 
 opened its 106th production facility. Additional plants are at the planning stage or  
already  under construction. Together, these measures set the stage in terms of production 
 technology for the Group to reach its ambitious growth targets.

The Group Strategy 2018 sets the pace. By 2018 the Volkswagen Group aims to be 
the world’s most successful, fascinating and sustainable automaker. Achieving this 
calls for  responsible long-term business practices that benefit everyone – employees, 
 customers, investors, environment and society. In all of this we put our trust in  
proven concepts, which we also transfer – from brand to brand, from region to region.

Think Blue. FacTory.
By 2018, we aim to cut resource consumption at all Volkswagen brand 
 production plants by 25% compared to 2010. This is the  philosophy  behind  
the “Think Blue. Factory.” program, part of our holistic attitude to  environ-  
mental responsibility across the Group. The plant at Emden in  Germany is a  
fine example.
One of 28 Volkswagen Group sites in Germany, the Emden plant ranks among the largest industrial employers in the East Frisia  region, 
with a workforce of around 8,900 employees. The plant celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2014. The Volkswagen brand’s Passat models 
manufactured here are shipped to more than 100 countries worldwide from the nearby port.

STRATEGY
Focus on Germany
The new bodywork plant at Emden commands an elevated 
position. Because it is located in an area of former marshland, the 
architects decided to build the foundations on raised piles. In this 
eco-friendly design, more than half of the 5,500 piles enclose 
 plastic pipes that run deep into the ground. The idea is to use the 
earth’s low temperature to cool the water running through the 
pipes to 10 °C. The water is then used to supply the bodywork 
 production machinery. Currently the largest shallow geothermal 
system in the world, this is just one aspect of the Emden plant’s 
commitment to the use of renewable energies.  
The site has hosted a wind farm (owned by the public utility 
Stadtwerke Emden) since 1994, and is now home to a total of 
 eleven turbines. Meanwhile, the largest photovoltaic system  in 
 Lower Saxony covers 3,000 m² of the factory’s roof space. In -
spir ed by these successful projects, the installation of a further 
 solar system  financed and operated by a workers’ cooperative is 
imminent.  Almost 80% of the heating for the plant’s buildings 
and production halls is carbon-neutral district heating from  
a nearby biomass power plant, fueled in part by poplars and 
 willows from the plant’s own energy forest. These environmen-
tal commitments have earned the Emden plant a reputation as 
the “blue  factory by the sea”. 
Blue is the color of efficiency for Volkswagen, as expounded in 
its “Think Blue.” concept. Launched in 2005 as a scheme to high-
light the Group’s most fuel-efficient car models (BlueMotion), 
since 2010 it has evolved into a holistic philosophy on environ-
mental responsibility. Since late 2011, “Think Blue. Factory.” 
has broadened the concept to include production operations,  
and set an ambitious target for the Volkswagen factories: by 
2018, the aim is to reduce the environmental impact per vehicle 
and component by 25% compared with 2010 levels. Attention 
 focuses on five key environmental factors: energy, water, waste, 
CO2 and solvent emissions, so that progress can be transparently 
measured. Volkswagen has also established a global standard to 
ensure uniform interpretation of the respective indicators.
A total of 27 of the 43 Volkswagen brand plants on four continents 
are currently taking part in the environmental program. By the 
end of September 2013, they had together identified resource- 
saving potential worth €114.3 million. More than one quarter of 
these measures are already up and running. In line with the 
Group’s declared aim of becoming the world’s most eco-friendly 
automobile manufacturer by 2018, this holistic, award-winning 
efficiency program will be successively rolled out to additional 
Group brands. ŠKODA has already adopted the entire system and is 
pursuing the 25% reduction target as part of its “Green Future” 
brand strategy. 
The corporate program “Think Blue. Factory.” was devised in 
 collaboration with the Volkswagen plants. The status quo (base-
line) was calculated for each plant, and binding targets were set 
 for 2018. A catalog of 140 measures has been created to aid im-
plementation. This is a concise compilation of best practices, pilot 
projects and technical innovations, and includes technical 
 details, environmental impacts and contact details to encourage 
knowledge-sharing between sites. From this catalog, the plants 
select the most appropriate measures for their purposes and 
 arrange them on what is called a “migration path” of their  own 
toward more eco-friendly production. “We have always been 
 passionate about environmental issues. ‘Think Blue. Factory.’ 
allows us to channel this passion in a more focused way”, says 
Thomas Laaken, Head of Environmental and Energy Manage-
ment at the Emden plant and local “Think Blue. Factory.” officer. 
The new ventilation system in the Emden assembly hall has at-
tracted a great deal of interest from colleagues in other plants. 
Sensors and state-of-the-art control technology have reduced 
the system’s electricity consumption by 80%, and it is also sig-
nificantly quieter. “We have invested around €1.4 million, but 
this has translated into savings of approximately €850,000 per 
annum”, says Laaken. The recently renovated administration 
building is likely to be a further talking point, as it has suc-
ceeded in reducing heat consumption by 80% and electricity 
consumption by 50%, thanks to high-performance insulation, 
LED lighting and heating/climate-control ceilings throughout, 
plus four high-efficiency mini combined heat and power plants 
in the cellar. 
3,400 resource-saving measures are 
being implemented at Volkswagen   
sites worldwide in the context of 
“Think Blue. Factory.”
“Think Blue. factory.” is thriving,  mainly because the indi-
vidual plants take inspiration from one another – and the sys - 
te matic involvement of the employees, who have a hands-on 
knowledge of the best potential resource savings in the produc-
tion sector. Consequently, “Think Blue. Factory” is closely inter-
linked with Volkswagen’s ideas management system. In order  
to sensitize employees to the environmental program and re-
duction targets, specially trained ambassadors from the various 
trades have been tasked with spreading the word and acting as 
expert points of contact.
One thing is clear: achieving a 25% reduction will prove 
challeng ing for everyone, particularly those sites that have al-
ready worked hard to maximize efficiency in the past. “Never-
theless, we are very confident”, says Laaken, who is even hoping 
to beat the CO2 emissions target, and achieve carbon-neutral 
production as early as 2018. Planning is already well underway  
to install four wind turbines at the plant.

OuR AppROACh
As one of the world’s biggest automakers we bear a special respon-
sibility for the environment and for people – whether as employees, 
customers, neighbors, or our suppliers’ employees. By 2050, from 
a current level of about one billion, the number of vehicles on the 
world’s roads will more than double. We will account for a con-
siderable share of this increase. It will involve new jobs, but also 
rising emissions and increasing resource consumption. So we 
consider it one of our most important tasks to make mobility as 
eco-friendly as possible and affordable for large numbers of 
 people. Individual mobility is not only a basic human need, but  
for many – especially in the emerging and developing economies – 
it is a sheer necessity. With trend-setting technologies and social 
competence we will make our contribution to a sustainable form of 
development that gives future generations the same opportunities 
as the present one.
By 2050 the number of vehicles on 
the world’s roads will have more 
than doubled.
Central Challenges
The Volkswagen Group has identified climate change, air quality, 
resource conservation and shifting demographic structures, es-
pecially in Europe and China, as primary central challenges with 
a global impact. These factors also involve social developments, 
which can differ widely depending on the individual markets. We 
analyze these developments carefully and gear our strategy to 
them in the interests of long-term success and profitability. Exam-
ples include progressive urbanization, increasing transparency 
requirements for businesses and a growing public awareness of 
employment and resource efficiency issues. These trends are ac-
companied by changes in consumer habits. Whereas a new middle 
class in the emerging economies wants high-quality products, the 
saturated market in Europe is calling for new services. At the same 
time new regulatory measures that have a considerable impact on 
our business operations are being introduced in both spheres.  
public awareness of employment and 
resource efficiency issues is growing.
Observation of environmental and social mega trends, analysis of 
the overall economic framework, tracking of upcoming customer 
trends and benchmarking against our competitors are brought 
together in a single process. This ensures that the important de-
cisions for production, procurement and sales structures are 
 taken with a ten-year timeline. Another instrument for identify-
ing challenges and expectations and for dealing with changing 
conditions is the stakeholder dialogue, which we cultivate at  
both Group and market level (see page 23).  
Our Strategy
To meet the challenges and ensure the Group’s sustainable suc-
cess, we have identified action areas and defined strategic objec-
tives for the year 2018. We have summarized these in a diagram 
in line with the three dimensions of sustainability – a vision that 
we pursue in all we do. This clearly outlines the pivotal key points 
for the entire Group for the years ahead.
CENTRAl. lOCAl.  
GlOBAl.
The Volkswagen Group has a clear goal: by 2018 we aim to be the world’s most succesfull, 
 fascinating and sustainable automobile manufacturer. For us, sustainable means a form of 
 responsible long-term economic activity that benefits everyone – employees, customers,  
investors, environment and society. This calls for appropriate endeavors by all brands in all 
 regions where they operate, and along the entire value chain.

Guidelines and principles
Our activities are governed not only by our strategic objectives, but 
also by our principles and voluntary undertakings. These include 
the following:
 > Volkswagen Group values: Our position is defined by seven 
values. These are customer focus, top performance, creating 
value, ability to renew, respect, responsibility and sustainabil- 
ity (2002). 
 6
 > Volkswagen Model of Sustainable Development: Adopted in 
2002 to mark the UN World Summit in Johannesburg (South 
Africa), this provides a Group-wide framework for sustainable 
and responsible action. 
 7
 > Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct: Introduced in 2010, this 
applies throughout the Group and provides managers and 
employees with a guide to meeting legal and ethical challeng-
es in their everyday work. The Code takes its lead from the 
Group values. 
 8
 > Commitment to United Nations Global Compact: In 2002 the 
Volkswagen Group signed the Global Compact, thereby com-
mitting itself to the Compact’s ten principles on human rights, 
labor, environment and anti-corruption. With our Communi-
cation on Progress on the implementation of these principles, 
in 2013 we again reached “Global Compact Advanced Level” 
(see also page 144).
  In 2013 this commitment was extended to include the CEO 
Water Mandate, which imposes obligations to make careful 
 use of water resources.  
We also make sure that our activities are in line with the
 
 > Declarations of the International Labour Organization (ILO),
 > Guidelines and conventions of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and 
 > UN international pacts on fundamental human rights and free-
 doms.
We have created our own framework for this purpose in the 
Volkswagen Social Charter, the Charter on Labour Relations 
and the Charter on Temporary Work, all of which apply through-
out the Group (see page 58). Group-wide environmental protec-
tion is governed by the Group’s Environmental Policy and its 
 Environmental Principles Product and Environmental Princi-
ples Production (see page 92).
The new XL1• is currently the world’s most economical and eco-friendly car. Here we use the most innovative systems and materials available in the 
 interests of maximum efficiency.

SuSTAINABlE GROwTh AS A ChAllENGE
The Volkswagen Group is growing. In five years’ time we will once 
again be supplying substantially more cars and trucks than we do 
 today. Of course, this also means we are contributing to rising CO2 
emissions and growing resource consumption. But the demand for 
individual mobility and transport services exists. What is more, it is 
increasing as globalization continues and as the emerging econo-
mies grow stronger and at the same time develop a new middle 
class. With innovative concepts we can ensure more jobs, greater re-
source efficiency and more renewable energy, and at the same time 
energetically pursue alternative drive technologies. However, we 
have no intention of limiting our marketing and advertising for our 
Group’s vehicles. After all, commercial success is the yardstick of all 
business activities, and it puts us in a position to invest in technolo-
gies of the future. There is no listed group in the world today that 
spends more money on research and development than Volkswagen. 
We use these resources to shape the mobility of  tomorrow – making 
it safer, better networked, more eco-friendly. And we stand by our 
aim that in everything we do – in production, in dealings with suppli-
ers and in employee involvement – we should  always be better from 
a sustainability point of view than our competitors.
Outlook
Our aim is to practice sustainability and corporate responsibility 
worldwide. With over 570,000 employees and 106 production 
facilities on four continents we are in a particularly good position 
to do so. Our approach is to transfer best practices from brand  
to brand, from region to region. There are already numerous  
examples of how this works – from the Modular Transverse  
Matrix for the Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and ŠKODA brands, 
through the dual vocational training and education system 
and in-service training opportunities that we introduce to the 
regions, to mobility services, concepts for road safety, social 
 responsibility and biodiversity projects. In this way we seek to 
turn our size and growth to good advantage and exercise our 
respon sibility for our employees, the environment and society.
SuSTAINABlE MANAGEMENT
The Volkswagen Group has made a commitment to transparent 
and responsible management. The greatest challenge for putting 
this into practice at all levels and in all stages of the value chain is 
our complexity: with twelve brands and more than 570,000 em-
ployees we are one of the biggest companies in Europe. We follow 
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 
and have geared the remuneration of the Board of Management to 
the Company’s long-term results. 
Remuneration of the Board of Management
The Group Board of Management has nine members. Every mem-
ber is responsible for one or more functions, and some members 
also have responsibility for a region. The Group Board of Ma n-
agement is supported in its work by the boards and management 
teams of the brands and regions, and of the other Group compa-
nies and affiliated companies. The remuneration of the Group 
Board of Management consists of a fixed and a variable compo-
nent. The variable component is made up of a bonus based on the 
performance of the business in the preceding two years, and 
(since 2010) a long-term incentive (LTI) which is based –  subject 
to an introductory phase – on a consideration of the preceding 
four financial years. Thus both elements of the variable compo-
nent are based on multi-year assessment criteria and take ac-
count of both favorable and unfavorable developments. 
On the Supervisory Board of the 
 Volkswagen Group there are three 
 women, two of them on the 
shareholder side.
Composition of the Supervisory Board
In accordance with the German Co-determination Act the Super-
visory Board, which appoints, oversees and advises the Board  
of Management, is made up of equal numbers of representatives 
of the shareholders and representatives of the employees. The 
Supervisory Board of the Volkswagen Board has a total of  
20 members, three of whom are women. Clear ideas have been  
formulated about the ideal composition of the Supervisory 
Board:
 > At least three seats should be held by individuals of a particu-
larly international character.
 > On the shareholder side, at least four members of the Supervi-
sory Board should be individuals free from potential conflicts 
of interests, especially conflicts which might arise from an ad-
visory or official function in regard to customers, suppliers, 
lenders, or other third parties.
 > Furthermore, at least four seats on the shareholder side should 
be occupied by individuals who are independent within the 
meaning of No. 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance 
Code.
 > At least three members of the Supervisory Board should be 
women, and at least two of these seats should be held by share-
holders.
 > As a rule, no person aged 75 or over at the time of the election 
should be nominated for elections.

STRATEGY
Coordination of Sustainability
To coordinate sustainability and corporate responsibility, 
Volkswagen has put in place a clear structure. The Group Board 
of Management (Sustainability Board) is also the highest-rank-
ing sustainability body in the company. It is informed about cor-
porate responsibility and sustainability issues by the Group CSR 
& Sustainability Steering Group at least twice a year and takes 
central decisions. The Group CSR & Sustainability Steering 
Group includes top managers from central Group business areas, 
the Group Works Council and representatives of the brands and 
regions. It meets four times a year, decides on the strategic sus-
tainability goals and signs off the Sustainability Report.
The Group CSR & Sustainability Steering Group is in turn sup-
ported by the CSR Office, which since 2006 has been coordinat-
ing all sustainability-related activities within the Group and the 
brands. Its remit also covers the stakeholder dialogue conducted 
at Group level including relations with sustainability-oriented 
analysts and investors. There are also several dedicated project 
teams, each working at crossfunctional level on tasks such as 
sustainability reporting or sustainability in supplier relations. 
These coordination and working structures have, with a few ex-
ceptions, also been established at the various brands and are 
 being continuously strengthened.
Global CSR Meeting
To promote dialogue across the Group, set up uniform structures 
and learn from one another, the CSR and sustainability coordi-
nators of all brands and regions have been meeting annually in 
Wolfsburg since 2009. The Global CSR Meeting has thus become 
an important element in the Group-wide coordination structure. 
In 2013 the following topics were on the agenda of the two-day 
meeting: Sustainability Reporting, Information Management, 
Stakeholder Management and Corporate Citizenship. All four 
topics were discussed in moderated working groups. The meet-
ing closed with the presentation of the results to the 70 partici-
pants: 
 > Sustainability Reporting: This means not only the Group 
Sustainability Report, but also the links between the various 
reporting and communication formats within the Group and 
their joint future development. The visibility of the brands is  
to be improved, the preparation processes synchronized and 
steps taken to ensure that key stakeholders are addressed.  
 > Information Management: Since all reporting is based on 
good data acquisition, the focus here was on designing a compu-
terized information system. How can such a system meet the re-
quirements of the Group and also of the brands and regions? 
What indicators are relevant, and at what level? What additional 
information of a qualitative nature is needed?

 > Stakeholder Management: Here the focus was on the question 
of the main stakeholders and the various levels. How can we de-
velop and refine efficient dovetailing of stakeholder manage-
ment between Group and brands and ensure that stakeholder 
expectations are addressed? This requires systematic identifi-
cation and classification of stakeholders and a basic approach 
that can also be transferred to the brands and regions. 
 > Corporate Citizenship:  The Volkswagen Group takes this to 
mean voluntary initiatives and activities that create added va-
lue for communities and society. A wide variety of relevant ap-
proaches and projects, many of them arising from traditional 
processes, exist within the Group and its brands and regions, 
including as many as five corporate foundations such as the 
Volkswagen Community Trust set up by the Volkswagen brand 
in South Africa, or the Audi Stiftung für Umwelt (Environment 
Foundation). The aim here is to find a common systematic ap-
proach that also permits an impact assessment to be drawn up.
Adopted in 2013: the Group 
Environmental Strategy.
 
Coordination of Environmental protection
In 2011 the Volkswagen Group appointed a Group Chief Officer for 
the Environment, Energy and New Business Areas, and took other 
important decisions for the ecological restructuring of the Group. 
At the end of 2013 the Group Board of Management approved the 
Environmental Strategy (see page 91). The Group Environmental 
Conference, which as a rule brings the environmental officers of 
the brands and regions together every four years, has been held 
since as long ago as 1998. Through the Corporate Environment 
and Energy Steering Group, which also reports to the Sustain-
ability Board, the coordination of these issues follows the struc-
ture described above for CSR & Sustainability. 
Coordination of Employee Responsibility
The framework is defined by the Corporate Personnel Manage-
ment (PM) department and implemented locally. In 2013 the PM 
strategy to support the Group goals for 2018 was adopted (see 
page 58). 
Coordination of Social Engagement
Social engagement falls largely within the responsibility of the 
brands, companies and sites. To ensure a certain standardization 
worldwide, the Group has defined central principles (see page 78). 
RISk MANAGEMENT
The sustainable success of our Company also depends on how 
quick we are to identify the risks and opportunities arising from 
our operations and how far-sighted we are in managing them. 
The Volkswagen Group’s responsible approach to risks is sup-
ported by a comprehensive risk management and internal con-
trol system. The organization of the Volkswagen Group’s risk 
management system (RMS) and internal control system (ICS) is 
based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organiza-
tions of the Treadway Commission). Here Volkswagen has chosen 
a holistic, integrated approach that combines the risk manage-
ment system, internal control system and compliance manage-
ment system in a single management strategy (Governance, Risk 
& Compliance strategy). As a result, the RMS/ICS ensures full 
coverage of all potential risk areas. The central body respon-
sible is the Group Board of Management. The Board examines 
risks and opportunities in connection with a wide variety of pro-
cesses. The Audit Committee of the Group Supervisory Board 
receives regular reports on the effectiveness of the RMS/ICS.  
The CSR & Sustainability Coordinators of the brands and regions met in 
Wolfsburg in June 2013.

STRATEGY
Three lines of Defense
As an integral part of our structures and procedures, our RMS is 
embedded in the day-to-day business processes of the Volkswagen 
Group. It adopts the “Three Lines of Defense” approach:  
 > The first line is the essential task of the divisions, companies 
and brands. Thanks to reports during the year via the paths 
documented above, the Board has an overall picture of the 
current risk situation at all times. The minimum require-
ments for the RMS/ICS are laid down in a single guidance 
 do cument for the entire Group. This also includes a process for 
timely notification of significant risks.
 > The second line is the Group Governance, Risk & Compliance 
(GRC) department. This sets standards for the RMS/ICS and 
coordinates the annual GRC control process. In this, the 
brands, major companies and individual functional areas 
identify risks and verify the effectiveness of the RMS/ICS. This 
serves as a basis for updating the overall picture of the poten-
tial risk situation and assessing the effectiveness of the system 
as a whole. The Group Board of Management receives a report 
on significant risks, defined in terms of quantitative and qual-
itative assessment criteria and a probability rating. 
 > The third line is Group Internal Audit, which makes regular 
checks on the structure and implementation of the risk ma n-
 agement system as part of its independent audit procedures.
Significant Risks
The biggest risks – i.e. risks with a high probability of occurrence 
and a large financial impact – may arise from 
 > adverse unit sales and market trends for vehicles and genuine 
parts
 > development and creation of products not suited to demand and
 > potential quality problems.

Environmental Risks
Risks that could impact on the financial result of the Volkswagen 
Group also include general environmental risks and climate 
change risks. Under the RMS these are identified, assessed and 
controlled by the Group’s divisions and companies. Examples of 
such risks include the following:
 > Extreme weather situations, storms or floods leading to failure 
of information and communication technology, supplier fai lure 
with production standstill or general production downtime in 
one of our more than 100 production facilities worldwide.
 > Regulatory measures, especially sanctions resulting from 
failure to achieve CO2 emission targets for the fleet or comply 
with emission standards required by cities and municipali-
ties. Emission requirements for vehicle taxation also play an 
important role here.
Alongside the risks described, the development of new drive tech-
nologies (hybrid and electric) may result in advantages compared 
with our competitors. In view of a broad change in public aware-
ness based on the depletion of fossil resources and a growing 
desire to protect the environment, these technologies promote 
the Group’s sales opportunities. 
For more information on RMS/ICS and on economic, political, 
financial and operational risks, see the risk report in the 2013 
Management Report.

STAkEhOlDER MANAGEMENT
In the long term we can only be successful if we are familiar with 
our stakeholders’ needs and expectations. The larger and more 
 diverse the Volkswagen Group and its products and services 
 become, the greater our stakeholders’ expectations will be and the 
broader the spectrum of relations that we need to actively address. 
These include analysts and investors, employees, talents, custo-
mers, neighbors, suppliers, business partners, legislators, public 
authorities, academia and non-governmental organizations.
Goal: Create understanding
For the Volkswagen Group, the dialogue with our stakeholders 
has many facets: it ranges from expectation management 
through innovation initiatives to risk identification. Here we 
pursue a systematic process and are basically in favor of an open 
and  constructive dialogue in which we learn from each other, 
but also set out our own interests. The outcome of this process 
should be at least a mutual understanding of the different back-
grounds and positions, but preferably a consensus on what a 
joint solution might look like. This should ideally be implement-
ed in a joint project from which both sides benefit. 
Stakeholder Relations at Group level
Direct contact with stakeholders, especially employees, talents, 
business partners and customers, is cultivated above all by the 
brands. At Group level we seek to bundle these processes and 
take an overarching approach to discussing Group-wide topics. 
This includes our dialogue with legislators, academia and non- 
governmental organizations. 
We are aware of the accusation that lobbying would run counter 
to the interests of open dialogue. And we openly admit that we 
too pursue our own interests – in awareness of our responsibility 
for employment and prosperity in many countries around the 
world. This is both necessary and legitimate. Our aim is to main-
tain the Group’s freedom of action. At the same time we help 
legis lators by contributing our expertise to the processes of 
legis lative and administrative decision making. We aim to do 
this as openly as possible, and have therefore joined the Europe-
an Commission’s Transparency Register. Here we disclose our 
objectives and the financial resources we allocate to represent-
ing our interests. We have representative offices in major Euro-
pean automotive locations. We do not make donations to politi-
cal  parties or party-affiliated institutions. 
 10
pOSITIONS ON pOlITICAl ISSuES
The central topic in 2013, which also dominated our dialogue 
with the NGOs, was the regulation of CO2 emission levels for Euro-
pean fleets of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The 
 Volkswagen Group spoke out at an early stage in favor of the 
 European political target of 95 g for cars, and at the same time 
 campaigned for  financial assistance for alternative technologies 
of central importance for decarbonizing the transport sector. 
 11
At Group level we particularly cultivate membership of organiza-
tions that involve an intensive dialogue on sustainable develop-
ment issues. At international level these primarily include our 
engagement with the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD), our participation in CSR Europe, a lead-
ing European network for social responsibility, and our work 
within the network of the UN Global Compact. We are also an 
active member of econsense, the sustainable development 
 forum of German industry, and the international initiative 
“Biodiversity in Good Company”. The information we gain from 
these sources is passed on to the brands and regions. Details of 
Group membership of other organizations can be found on the 
Internet.

for 17 years a stakeholder panel has 
been evaluating our reporting.
Stakeholder panel and Annual Evaluation
In cooperation with the Institute for Market, Environment and 
Society (imug) we established a stakeholder panel, which has 
now been running for 17 years. It follows our activities, especially 
our environmental and sustainability reporting activities, and 
produces a critical commentary every year. To this end, imug 
holds detailed interviews with a total of 33 representatives of 
 different stakeholder groups. This evaluation helps us to cri-
tically scrutinize and improve our Sustainability Report, and 
also provides information about weaknesses in our Group-wide 
 sustainability coordination.

The 2012 Group Sustainability Report scored very well on the 
whole – in fact it was rated the best ever. Criticism was voiced 
about its size: 170 pages. At the same time, however, the stake-
holder representatives’ comments indicate a need to improve 
the content, calling for more detailed treatment of quite a num- 
 
ber of topics. The main recommendations are set out briefly 
 below. We have also tried to address them in this report:
 > Indicators: Important indicators should be emphasized and 
their significance for management discussed. It would also be 
desirable to place the data in context and offer means of compa r-
ing them – both internally and with competitors. 
 > Dilemmas: The report should devote more space to critical 
issues and discuss conflicts of interest. This also includes the 
issue of lobbying.
 > Product responsibility: As a global group, Volkswagen also 
bears responsibility for what happens to vehicles after they have 
been sold, and ought to make this clear. Stakeholders also want 
to see more about road safety.
 > Intelligent mobility: The Group should provide a more detailed 
presentation that is not confined to thinking within the Group, 
but also includes aspects going beyond its limits, such as how to 
design cities worth living in.
 > Dealing with conflict materials: This topic should be dealt 
with in greater detail. Stakeholders want to know where the 
raw materials used by the Group come from. There should also 
be a description of concrete measures.
 > Social engagement: The connection between social engage-

would also be desirable.
Stakeholder Surveys
The brands Audi, MAN, Volkswagen and Porsche have carried out 
their own – mostly very extensive – online surveys of their stake-
holders, as have Volkswagen do Brasil and Volkswagen Financial 
Services. Moreover, in 2013 all companies in the Volkswagen 
Group took part in the “Stimmungsbarometer” – an opinion sur-
vey for employees of the Volkswagen Group (see page 67). This 
was the first Group-wide investigation of employee needs and in-
terests. In future it will be conducted in this form every two years. 
The Group also has a standardized procedure for communica-
tion with customers. The Volkswagen brand, for example, runs a 
Marketing KPI Cockpit survey four times a year in 30 countries. 
In 2013 the brand and model image section for the first time in-
cluded and  analyzed issues of direct relevance to sustainability.
 
STAkEhOlDER ENGAGEMENT AT VOlkSwAGEN DO BRASIl
In 2013 Volkswagen do Brasil published a Yearbook on sustain-
ability as the outcome of an intensive process of identifying 
stakeholder needs. The following central groups were identified: 
dealers, suppliers, customers, employees, third parties and the 
Group. The most important topics to emerge from the materia l-
ity analysis were: non-discrimination, anti-corruption, product 
 re s p on sibility and freedom of association.
Dialogue and Cooperation
Both the Volkswagen Group and the brands maintain an inten-
sive dialogue with their stakeholders – their own employees, 
customers, suppliers, business partners and their local neigh-
bors. This also includes a constructive exchange with public 
 authorities and in most cases intensive long-term cooperation 
with organizations representing social and environmental in-
terests. This is prompted by a desire not only to be a responsible 
corporate citizen but also to obtain insight into external percep-
tions of our own activities.
RAISING AwARENESS AMONG MANAGEMENT
In 2012 MAN Truck & Bus initiated the “Manage responsibly” 
training course to integrate corporate responsibility in HR and 
management development. The training course was successfully 
continued in 2013. It puts managers in a position to implement 
the CR and climate strategy in their own areas of responsibility. To 
date, nearly 300 managers and multipliers have taken part in 
more than 30 half-day training sessions.
NEIGhBORhOOD DIAlOGuES
For the past 15 years Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has been 
engaged in a dialogue with its neighbors at the Hanover site in 
Germany, because the factory is situated close to residential 
 areas. It maintains a particularly intensive dialogue with the con-
tact group elected by the participants, which meets several times 
a year for discussion with company representatives. This has 
made it possible to reduce misgivings and build up a climate of 
mutual understanding. For some years now, similar discussions 
have also been taking place at our Poznan´ site in Poland. The focus 
is not only on exchanging information and reaching an under-
standing with the neighbors, but also on long-term initiatives 
aimed at supporting and promoting various groups in local society.
COOpERATION wITh NABu
For the past 13 years Volkswagen and NABU, Germany’s biggest 
environmental and nature conservation organization, have been 
engaged in a unique form of cooperation. Entitled “Mobile for 
mankind and nature”, it is reflected in a wide variety of projects 
and an ongoing critical dialogue on issues relating to environmen-
tal protection and sustainability. The environmental program 
deve lo ped jointly by NABU and Volkswagen Leasing GmbH, an 
eco -friendly fleet management service offered to major custo-
mers, makes a substantial contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. 
The annual presentation of the “Green Fleet” award aims to en-
courage others to follow this example. Wherever possible, the 
partners link their initiatives for resource efficiency and environ-
mental protection with NABU’s core concern, the conservation of 
nature and biodiversity. Important initiatives include not only the 
re hydration of peat and bog areas, but also the renaturing of the 
Lower Havel river, Europe’s biggest river meadow project. Since 
2003 the partners have organized nationwide fuel economy  action 
days in cooperation with local NABU groups and Volkswagen dea l-
ers. The “Mobile Dialogue” series of events fosters the public de-
bate about major environmental and transport policy issues. 
“Welcome Wolf” is the title of an information campaign which has 
staged numerous activities since 2004 to promote protection for 
the wolves reintroduced into Germany.

STRATEGY
REpORTING AND ISSuES MANAGEMENT
Group-wide sustainability reporting plays a central role in the 
context of strategic development, because it creates internal trans-
parency, bundles topics and facilitates coordination. But of course 
it also has a substantial part to play in terms of external presenta-
tion. For example, the Group Sustainability Report with its sum-
mary of progress builds a bridge to society, forming the basis for 
dialogue, understanding and further progress. In May 2013 the 
Group Sustainability Report, which follows the guidelines of the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the associated Internet 
presence (microsite) were confirmed by the Group Board of Man-
agement as the Group’s central reporting platform for sustainabil-
ity and corporate responsibility.  
Status within the Group
The Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania and ŠKODA brands prepare 
their own GRI-based sustainability reports. While the other 
brands and companies engage in target-group oriented commu-
nication on the subject, they do not produce a systematic GRI 
 report of their own. For the present sustainability report, a 
 company software tool was used for the first time to gather and 
document facts and figures. It is to be developed and expanded 
in future to support reporting and management within the 
Group. The existing microsite is also to be developed into a 
 closely dovetailed sustainability site for the Group and its 
brands.
Materiality Analysis 
The Volkswagen Group uses a number of instruments to acquire 
the many topics and goals. From future research via stakeholder 
dialogue to our internal environment radar, they supply us with 
important information that is used in developing our strategy and 
in our reporting. In late 2013 we used the existing materiality 
 matrix and the results of the various stakeholder surveys by the 
brands and companies to identify important recurring topics. In 
addition to the customer survey for the Volkswagen brand (see 
page 25), which covered answers from some 120,000 respon-
dents, these included the broad stakeholder surveys for the 
 Audi, MAN and Porsche brands as well as Volkswagen Financial 
Services. To gether these surveys reach out to more than 6,000 
respondents, with response rates of up to 40%.
We are of course well aware that this is not yet a consistent and 
 systematic process taking equal account of all brands and compa-
nies. It was, however, adequate for identifying the material topics. 
In assessing the topics as set out in the Group materiality matrix, 
we take the following as our three central criteria:
 > stakeholder expectations,
 > the significance for the Company and
 > the extent to which the Company can influence the topic. 
Resource-efficient products and 
 production were rated much more 
important than in 2012.
Our understanding of the Material Topics
The materiality analysis 2013 primarily involved arriving at more 
precise definitions of topics in line with the Group strategy for 
2018. The biggest shift was seen in “resource-efficient products 
and production”, which our internal experts rated several degrees 
more important for the Company than in 2012. The importance of 
other topics remained more or less constant. What do they mean 
for us?
 > Employer attractiveness and employment: Stands for the 
way industry makes a substantial contribution to society by 
creating and offering jobs, and for everything that goes to 
make up an attractive employer – training, involvement, 
health, occupational safety, ergonomics and concepts for re-
sponding to demographic change.
 > Environmental and climate protection: We take this to 
mean overarching activities and concepts, such as our envi-
ronmental management system, or mutual knowledge transfer 
on such topics, which help to improve the Group’s environ-
mental protection and climate response.
 > Economic stability: For us, this means more than just sales and 
profits. It also includes aspects like local sourcing, which seeks 
to ensure a broad and balanced supplier base, safeguarding 
against capital market risks, and forward-looking management 
activities.  
 > Customer satisfaction: Goes beyond satisfaction with our 
products and includes not only evaluation of our service and 
our dealer networks, but also all aspects of practiced product 
responsibility and quality assurance. It also includes our abili-
ty to speedily identify new needs in the various markets and 
translate them into solutions.
 > Resource-efficient products and production: For us this 
means making efficient and sparing use of resources over the 
entire life cycle. The topic embraces a whole bundle of concepts 
ranging from product development, through purchasing and 
 production, to the product use phase. 
Our understanding of all the topics in the materiality matrix can 
be found on the Internet.

Decision and Outlook
At the beginning of 2014 the Group CSR & Sustainability Steering 
Group approved the materiality matrix as the valid description 
and corridor for the ongoing strategic development of responsibi l-
ity and sustainability in the Volkswagen Group. In preparation for 
the new requirements set out in the GRI’s G4 guidance document, 
we will devise an approach that takes greater account of the 
brands’ activities, bundles their findings better and feeds them 
into a Group analysis. 
To ensure a systematic approach to stakeholder management 
within the Group, in 2014 we are introducing an IT-based issue 
and stakeholder module. This will help to assess the importance of 
individual stakeholder groups and link this evaluation with the 
assessment of issues. It thus forms the basis for stakeholder- 
oriented issues management in 2014 that helps to uphold the 
reputation of the Group.

Growth   
The Volkswagen Group is aiming to deliver more than 10 million vehicles per 
year worldwide from 2018. One central driver of this growth is the Chinese 
 market, where for years Audi has been setting standards in the premium segment 
with its products and technologies. Now the brand is appealing to new target 
groups and customers with a digital showroom and a selection of used cars.  
the Volkswagen Group began to tap into the chinese market in the early 1980s. in 1988 Volkswagen and audi began collaboration with 
local partner first automotive Works (faW) based in changchun. the joint venture’s first factory has been followed by another 16 plants, 
the most recent opening at the end of 2013 in foshan. the gearbox plant in tianjin will start production in the second half of 2014.

Focus on China
Prestige matters in china. At the dealerships run by Patrick 
Chou, it is increasingly image that tips the balance when a cus-
tomer is faced with the choice: will it be a new mid-size car or a 
used premium model? The market for used cars in China is still 
in its infancy. In 2013, for every new car sold, 0.35 used cars 
found new owners – compared with 2.4 in Germany. Having said 
that, with sales hitting between an estimated 6 and 6.5 million 
vehicles (2013), the Chinese market is already, in the space of 
just a few years, matching the volumes of large European coun-
tries (Germany 2013: 7.1 million). And the share of premium 
models in that number rose sharply to 8.8% in 2013. 
“Buying a used car is all about trust, and that has to be built up”, 
says Chou, CEO of authorized Audi dealer group Better Life. Audi 
is making every effort to respond to this challenge in China. For 
example, the Audi stands at motor shows feature special used car 
terminals. Prospective customers are offered financing arrange-
ments and an extensive range of services and warranty  packages.
With 291 authorized dealers,  of which 60 are exclusive Audi 
 centers, Audi has the largest dealer network for used cars, with 
almost 27,000 ve hicles (+55%) sold in 2013. More than half of 
these belonged to the key “young used cars” segment (less than 
five  years old) as part  of the brand’s own “Audi refined recom-
mendation User Car”  program (+72% year on year).
This is another example of the influential role played by Audi in 
the Chinese car market. The premium manufacturer has been 
building cars in Changchun, northern China since 1988 – first 
under license, then in a joint venture with Volkswagen and local 
partner First Automotive Works (FAW). And since April 2013 the 
Audi Q3 has been rolling off the assembly line there alongside 
the Audi Q5 and special long-wheelbase versions of the Audi A4 
and Audi A6 models. All four models are market leaders in their 
respective segments. Sales have kept pace with the rapid growth 
of the Chinese economy in general. By 2010, Audi had sold 1 mil-
lion vehicles in China and Hong Kong, with the 2-million mile-
stone coming up just three years later. With 491,989 units sold  
(+21%), the brand celebrated a record-breaking year in 2013. 
That makes Audi by far the largest premium carmaker in China. 
And by the same token, China is the most important market of the 
future for Audi – and the Volkswagen Group as a whole. Indeed,  in 
2013 and 2014 the Group is opening seven new factories in China 
as part of its bid to become the world’s largest automaker by 2018. 
As a result, annual production is expected to rise from 3.27 million 
vehicles at present to over four million.
the breathtaking pace of expansion of the Chinese car mar-
ket has slowed. The years of up to 46% growth (2009) have been 
followed by more moderate gains, most recently of 19%. State 
help-to-buy initiatives and high inventories have expired, and 
 registration restrictions are now in effect.  Beijing and five other 
cities have placed additional limits on pri vate car registrations, 
and other smog-plagued cities are keen to follow suit. However, ex-
perts continue to rate the prospects for  sales as very healthy. In 
2013, China recorded some 16 million new registrations, making 
it the world’s second-largest market, just behind the USA. 
The engine for this continuing growth is the newly moneyed 
 middle class. Accordingly, nine out of ten Audi buyers in China are 
private customers. On average they are in their mid-thirties, well 
educated and often female, and most have a family. For roughly 
one third, an Audi is their first car. “Many people see compact 
 premium cars as entry-level models”, explains Rene Koneberg, 
Head of Audi China Brand Marketing. In this segment Audi builds 
not one but two model series in China: along with the Audi Q3  
in Changchun, since early 2014 the Audi A3 has been built at the 
new FAW-Volkswagen plant in Foshan, southern China. Together, 
the two plants will drive up annual production to 700,000 units 
over the medium term. 
“Buying a used car is all about trust,  
and that has to be built up.”
patrick chou, ceo of authorized audi dealer  
group Better life in Beijing
 
and they will do so the green way. Foshan is one of the most 
environment-friendly car factories in China. And it’s not just the 
factories, because the Volkswagen Group’s € 9.8 billion investment 
drive also includes a focus on building highly efficient products. 
An efficiency program launched in 2011 has seen the average fuel 
consumption of locally built Audi models drop by one fifth. Con-
tributory factors here have included the integration of start-stop 
technology, brake energy recovery and lightweight components. 
In the future-focused electric mobility market, meanwhile, the 
premium manufacturer is looking to introduce e-tron technology 
soon, and already offers three full-hybrid models. Moreover, Audi 
is to build an engine that complies with the Euro 6 standard on site 
in China, thereby bringing future EU standards to the country.  As 
a result, the fuel consumption limits announced by the Chinese 
government – an average 5 l/100 km by 2020 – are no problem 
for Audi. The brand won several awards in China in 2013 for its 
 en vironment friendliness and levels of customer satisfaction. 
The brand’s customer-centric approach can be experienced in the 
fresh new surroundings of Audi City, which opened in Beijing in 
early 2013. Intuitively controlled powerwalls allow around 8,000 
visitors per week to configure a full-size version of their personal 
dream car – from the inside, from the outside and using many 
 color and equipment options. In the digital showroom on the first 
floor, visitors with a strong interest in purchasing a car can experi-
ence the haptic qualities of 15 display models, compare leather 
samples and wheel rims, and receive personal consultation. 
Beijing is the second city (after London) in which Audi has used the 
Audi City concept to appeal to younger target groups in particular. 
“In China, where in the past customers have tended to buy their 
cars off the shelf, we are moving customer behavior to a higher 
 level of individualization,” says marketing manager Koneberg. 
And that will be another growth driver in this expanding market.

Safeguarding economic stability is one of the most important goals 
for the Volkswagen Group. To ensure sustainable and stable 
growth we are constantly tapping new fields of potential: optimi z-
ing our production processes and refining our products, as well as 
making extensive investments in research and development, our 
plant and equipment and our employees. 
Diversification of our product portfolio and broad-based positio n-
ing in the global markets also serve to promote economic stability 
by helping to reduce sectoral and geographical risks. By localizing 
value-added we can not only respond more flexibly to customer 
needs but also offset volatile exchange rates and mitigate risks 
 resulting from protectionism.  
challenges and goals
The changing structure of the global economy and the growth 
prospects of individual countries and regions pose substantial 
challenges for the Volkswagen Group. In addition, the increasingly 
hard-fought competition in the various markets and the growing 
size and complexity of the Company call for a strategy that offers an 
effective response to both local requirements and global trends.  
While in the USA demand for automobiles continued its recovery 
in 2013, it was above all the ongoing economic uncertainties  
in Western Europe that led to the weakest overall level of market 
activity of the past 20 years. At the same time, the intensity of com-
petition in what since 2008 has been the world’s fastest-growing 
sales region – Asia-Pacific – is constantly increasing. Along with 
the revived American automakers and the Japanese and Korean 
manufacturers who continue to expand, in the future the Chinese 
brands too will be building on their existing positions both within 
and outside China. German automobile manufacturers, parti c-
ularly hard hit by the current weak state of the European market, 
are adapting capacities, stepping up cooperative activities and ex-
panding their global presence in pursuit of a decisive improve-
ment in their competitive position. At the same time, the shift in 
the global economy’s centers of growth continues. Above all the 
BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) will continue to 
gain importance in both economic and political terms, exercising 
a decisive influence on the state of the global economy.

2013 brought up another important milestone for the Volkswagen Group on its way to becoming 
the world’s leading automobile manufacturer, with a new record number of vehicles delivered. 
Unit sales rose 5% to 9.73 million vehicles.  That puts Volkswagen in second place in the worldwide 
rankings, with the second-highest growth in absolute terms.

For the Volkswagen Group the rapid growth of many emerging 
economies offers substantial opportunities in terms of the volume 
of sales. The social rise of broad swaths of the population and the 
rapid increase in the level of prosperity are giving rise to new 
groups of potential buyers with numerous local and international 
automakers competing for their custom. Consequently, success-
fully accessing new markets in the growth regions calls for the 
 development of a localized and market-led product offering. But  a 
global growth strategy can only succeed if the profitability of 
 these products is assured. Moreover, high levels of flexibility and 
financial autonomy are essential in order to mitigate the effects 
of economic downturns and crises. The recent years of crisis 
have shown that investments in the development of products, 
processes and employees pay dividends and provide the key to 
lasting corporate success. 
Policies and guidelines
Our business activities are governed by our policies and the stra-
tegic goals of the Group:
 >  Volkswagen Group corporate values:  Defined in 2002, these 
lay the foundations for our activities (see page 18). 
 6
 >  Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct:  Introduced in 2010, the 
Group-wide Code of Conduct (see page 18) must also be respec t-
ed by our business partners. We reserve the right to have com-
pliance with the requirements of the Code verified by experts. 
The Volkswagen Group also expects its business partners to 
 ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct by their own 
 suppliers. 
 8
 >  The Volkswagen Group requirements regarding sustain-
ability in its relationships with business partners (Code of 
Conduct for business partners):  Originally defined in 2006, 
the requirements were revised in 2013. They set out the Group’s 
expectations concerning its business partners’ conduct with re-
gard to central environmental and social standards and are 
based on documents such as the Principles of the United Nations 
Global Compact, the International Chamber of Commerce’s 
Business Charter for Sustainable Development and the relevant 
con ventions of the International Labour Organization. These 
principles are supplemented by Volkswagen’s Environmental 
Policy, the resulting environmental targets and requirements, 
the Group’s Quality Policy and the Volkswagen Declaration on 
 Social Rights. 
 16
 > Quality Policy:  In 2008 the Volkswagen brand issued a Quality 
Policy which covers product quality, process quality, customer 
satisfaction and on-time delivery. Similar policies are in force at 
the other Group brands.

modular transverse matrix
One key instrument in the pursuit of our economic goals is the 
Modular Transverse Matrix, also known by its German abbrevi-
ation MQB, which helps make our production operations flexi-
ble and efficient. For one thing it enables us to use identical com-
ponents in different models, reducing the cost of each individual 
 vehicle. And for another the MQB permits the replacement of 
in dividual components in response to revised customer wishes. 
This enables the Group to react promptly to changes in the 
 marketplace and avoid excess capacities and misallocation of 
 resources.
At the Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and ŠKODA brands the MQB was 
introduced in 2012. Models already based on the MQB include the 
new Golf, the Audi A3, the ŠKODA Octavia and the SEAT Leon. In 
the near future, across the Group 40 models based on the MQB will 
be brought to market.

market strategy “go west” 
China remains the Volkswagen Group’s most important single 
market. In 2013, the Group sold a total of more than 3.3 million 
vehicles in China, including some 3 million produced in the 
country itself. Our production plants in China are currently  
at the  limits of their capacity. The Volkswagen Group is there - 
fore planning to expand its local production capacity from 3 to 4 
million  vehicles by 2018. In this respect, the Volkswagen Group 
is responding to the wishes of the Chinese government for  
a stronger engagement in the west of the country and, among 
other things, is building a new plant in the northwestern region 
of Xinjiang. The region is gene rally considered a source of 
 unrest, because the indigenous  Uyghur people, a Muslim 
 minority, feel that they are the victims of political, religious and 
economic repression. Volkswagen is ai ming to integrate 
 Uyghurs into the workforce at the new plant, based on a clear 
strategy of recruiting members of minorities in line with the 
proportion of the general population that they represent. 
 18
the challenge oF new markets
the engagement of shanghai Volkswagen (sVW) in urumqi in the 
Xinjiang region of china is under critical scrutiny. it is widely known 
that this area is subject to conflicts between the various ethnic 
groups. moreover, its economy and infrastructure are less deve l-
oped than those of other chinese regions. so the decision by the 
Volkswagen Group to build a production site there is accompanied 
by many challenges, not least in the field of sustainability. But the 
Group stands for a long-term strategy, as evidenced by the estab-
lishment of a training center in urumqi. in addition, we have initia t-
ed numerous projects in the fields of environmental protection, ed-
ucation and sport. that’s because we believe in this important 
market and consider it our duty to drive progress here. We are also 
supporting the expansion of the local healthcare sector, for exam-
ple, by funding exchanges and scholarships for young doctors. 
Quality assurance
The growing number of production sites and market-specific 
model variants within our worldwide production network leaves 
quality assurance facing a major task. Our aim, in terms of reli-
ability, functionality and perceived quality is to be “best of local”. 
That means operating at least at the same level as the best com-
petitor in each case. With extended safety, comfort and electronics 
systems or new drive technologies finding their way increasingly 
into high-volume models, their integration needs to be tested  
at the early concept stage in order to ensure reliable, safe and 
trouble-free functionality. 
Product resPonsiBilitY 
We believe that offering our customers a wide range of efficient, 
affordable and practical powertrain and fuel technologies in order 
to reduce climate risks is the right way forward, although this ap-
proach requires extensive innovation and investment. At the same 
time, we set ourselves apart from other manufacturers by focusing 
our high quality standards not least on the mass market. The 
 strategic framework for our product development work is pro vided 
by three key objectives from the Volkswagen Group’s environ-
mental management system – climate protection, resource con-
servation and healthcare.
all over the world, some 40,000 
 Volkswagen group engineers are 
working on the innovations of 
tomorrow.
innovation management
In 2013, the Volkswagen Group spent approximately €10.2 billion 
on research and development. Over the coming five years, further 
investment of €84.2 billion in developing new models, environ-
mentally friendly drive technologies and optimized production 
processes is planned. In order to offer all our customers products 
that are not only precisely tailored to their needs but also environ-
mentally compatible, we are working intensively on solutions that 
range from highly efficient, eco-friendly diesel, petrol and natural 
gas engines to innovative hybrid drive systems and all-electric 
 vehicles. Our aim is to be the world leader in electric mobility 
by 2018. The study “Industrial R&D Investment Scorecard”, un-
dertaken for the EU Commission, reveals that Volkswagen is 
 investing more in research and development than any other com-
pany in the world. The study compared the research and develop-
ment expenditure of 2,000 international companies from a range 
of different sectors. 
39

In its research into more efficient and more responsible forms  of 
mobility, the Group is also looking into the use of alternative mate-
rials for automotive manufacturing and the various aerodynamic 
design options. Our research and development centers include 
sites in Wolfsburg (Germany), Anchieta (Brazil), Changchun and 
Shanghai (China) and Puebla (Mexico). Cooperating in some cases 
with universities and research institutes, the R&D centers are 
working on projects whose results will benefit the industry as a 
whole. In July 2013, the Volkswagen brand and the Fraunhofer 
Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology (IWU) pre-
sented the findings of their joint research project “Innovation 
Alliance Green Carbody Technologies” InnoCaT®, under which 
Volkswagen and more than 60 partners, led by the IWU, deve loped 
innovative solutions for future car body production processes. The 
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) con-
tributed €15 million of funding towards this project. 
world’s most innoVatiVe automaker 
in 2013, the center of automotive management (cam) and audit 
firm pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) named the Volkswagen Group 
the world’s most innovative automobile manufacturer, for the third 
consecutive year, based on an independent analysis carried out by 
cam and pwc. Volkswagen also achieved the best ratings in  the 
“conventional powertrain”, “alternative powertrain” and “informa-
tion and communication systems” categories.
 
road safety
Road safety is a key research and development focus in the 
 Volkswagen Group. The Group’s accident research departments 
play a pivotal role in this work, reconstructing and evaluating 
accidents in order to obtain information that will help boost 
 future vehicle safety. Although the number of road accidents in 
industrialized countries is falling, in developing countries it 
continues to rise. All of the Group’s brands offer advanced sys-
tems for the protection of driver and occupants. Our aim is to 
make these systems available to as many of our customers as 
possible. For example, the Volkswagen brand fits the Anti-lock 
Braking System and the Electronic Stability Program as stan-
dard on all its vehicles. The current-generation Golf is the first 
compact model to be fitted with assistance systems such as 
 Automatic Distance Control, the Front Assist Ambient Traffic 
Monitoring System and the Lane Assist lane-keeping system. 
Along with the City Emergency Braking function with pedestrian 
recognition, new developments also include Emergency Assist, 
which intervenes if the system detects no steering or braking in-
puts from the driver. 
 19
Innovative driver assistance systems not only serve to make 
 driving safer, they also make it less stressful. This is particularly 
important against a background of ageing populations in many 
parts of the world. The new technologies are based on improved 
sensors and intelligent connectivity. A system has even been de  ve l-
oped which allows the vehicle to be parked by radio remote control 
or using a smartphone app. 
 20 
On the active safety front the Group is involved in a variety of 
 pro j ects around the world aimed at improving road safety aware-
ness. For example a road safety partnership between the Volkswagen 
brand and ADAC will allow Volkswagen to use ADAC’s Safety 
Demonstration Centers to stage its own driver training programs. 
And since 2010, Volkswagen and ADAC have to date organized

more than 4,000 events under a joint initiative entitled “Safety  in

out more about how to transport their children safely by car. And    
in China the Volkswagen brand is sponsoring a television program 
on road safety. 
Focus on road saFetY
the ŠKoda brand based in the czech republic has made road safety 
a strategic pillar of its social engagement. the country’s traffic 
 fatalities are 42% higher than the european average. the company’s 
main aims here are to support education on the topic  of road safety, 
to promote public and political engagement and to  improve the 
passive safety of road vehicles. to this end, ŠKoda is stepping up its 
research activities and providing road safety information on two 
cooperating websites. 
 21
Product safety
With more than 9 million vehicles coming off the Volkswagen 
Group’s assembly lines every year, quality assurance – at all stages 
from purchasing right through to sales – is of vital importance.  For 
example an in-house-tested and proven risk management system 
has been introduced which allows high quality standards to be 
 ensured at a very early stage in the supply chain. Standardized 
processes, which are continuously optimized, provide a bench-
mark in all parts of the value chain. And over recent years, we have 
continued to standardize our defect elimination process so that we 
can react even more quickly in the future to vehicle problems and 
help our customers even faster. 
Vehicles recalled For Fuse swaP
no matter how intensive the quality assurance process may be, 
faults can never be completely ruled out. in late 2013, in-service 
 vehicle monitoring by the Volkswagen brand identified a fuse fault 
on the tiguan model that in some cases could lead to failure of one 
of the vehicle’s two light circuits. although some lights would 
 remain on, illuminating the vehicle perimeter, and although the 
driver would be informed of the problem on the instrument cluster, 
Volkswagen responded by recalling approximately 800,000 vehicles 
worldwide, built between early 2008 and mid-2011. last year, 
 the Volkswagen brand issued a voluntary recall for vehicles with 
seven-speed dual-clutch transmission sold in the asian market, 
 inviting customers to visit a workshop for an oil exchange after it 
was found that the synthetic oil used in these transmissions can 
cause malfunctioning of the transmission power supply.

customer satisfaction
In line with Strategy 2018, customer satisfaction is of paramount 
importance for all Volkswagen Group brands. The Group monitors 
customer satisfaction using standardized performance indicators 
which are the same for all brands and include brand image, de-
sirability, future purchase consideration, product quality and 
brand communication awareness. 
Across the world, satisfaction studies are carried out for all Group 
brands, focusing on the key areas of product, service and dealers. 
We use the study findings to ensure that we always maintain our 
focus on customer requirements and constantly improve our prod-
uct and process quality. Volkswagen, Audi, ŠKODA and Porsche 
were again able to improve their customer satisfaction ratings 
compared to the previous year. In the USA, the Porsche and Audi 
brands took first and second places respectively for product satis-
faction. In China, Porsche led the way on dealer and product satis-
faction, while Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche took joint first place 
for service satisfaction. In their European home market, Audi and 
Porsche came first on dealer satisfaction, while Porsche also came 
first on product satisfaction, closely followed by Audi and ŠKODA in 
joint second place.  
information and labeling
As product manufacturers, all companies in the Volkswagen 
Group are obliged to suitably inform the users of their products 
about dangers that can ensue during correct operation and fore-
seeable misuse of the product and warn them accordingly. The 
Group companies meet these requirements through instruction 
manuals and in individual cases through warning stickers in the 
vehicle. 
Since December 1, 2011, it has been mandatory for all new cars in 
Germany to be labeled with a weight-based efficiency label similar 
to the energy labeling system used for household appliances. Effi-
ciency classes range from A+ (very efficient) to G (inefficient). The 
label also provides information on fuel consumption, annual fuel 
costs, CO2 emissions and the amount of tax payable under Germa-
ny’s CO2-based vehicle tax. For electric vehicles, the label provides 
information on electricity consumption. All Group brands also use 
their websites to provide information on the fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions of their models. The fuel consumption and emis-
sion figures for all models referred to in this report can be found 
on page 138. The Volkswagen brand also publishes Environmen-
tal Commendations (see page 99), which describe improvements 
in the environmental performance  of new vehicles and technolo-
gies over their predecessors or refe rence models.
local Value added
Within its growth strategy, the Volkswagen Group is focusing on 
localizing the value-added process. As a concept, localization 
stands for the regional integration and concentration of produc-
tion activities and helps offset many of the drawbacks of an inter-
national distribution of labor in ecological, economic and social 
terms. Relocating supplier firms in the vicinity of new production 
plants creates new jobs and the local population benefits from 
 rising prosperity. At the same time, the concept of localization 
also brings with it numerous economic advantages. These in-
clude lower logistics costs, procurement prices in line with local 
market conditions, elimination of import duties and immunity 
from  volatile exchange rates.
economic Benefits of localization
One inestimable advantage of localization is the proximity to the 
customer that it brings. This makes it easier to identify specific 
 regional customer needs and design products accordingly. Also, 
products manufactured in the vicinity enable local people to iden-
tify with them. So the concept of localization systematically pur-
sued by the Volkswagen Group serves not least to open up new 
 markets. Thanks to the MQB we have a uniform global platform on 
which to make specific regional adaptations to our models while  
at the same time keeping our production operations lean and effi-
cient. To prepare the ground, we observe the various markets, 
 obtain information and link up to the regional knowledge net-
works. Our decentralized production and research sites provide 
valuable regional bases for these activities. 
contributing to regional development
Through the localization of value added, we are giving people  in 
many parts of the world an opportunity to improve their standard 
of living. Many jobs are being created at our newly built plants in 
places such as Silao (Mexico), Foshan and Urumqi (China),  leading 
to additional jobs being generated outside the Company a mong 
suppliers, service providers and local craftsmen. In Pune (India) 
for example, since the Volkswagen plant was set up, 67 new sup-
plier companies have been founded, together providing work for 
around 13,000 people. 
AUDI AG is underpinning its successful growth in the North 
American market by establishing a new plant in San José Chaipa, 
Mexico. The cornerstone ceremony took place in May 2013. The 
plant will have its own body shop, paintshop, assembly lines  
and press shop, representing an investment of more than €900 
million. Three years before start of production is scheduled, in 
the summer of 2013 the first training course began for 64 future 
mechanics and mechatronics specialists. Training is aligned 
with the German dual model of vocational training that unites 
theory and practice. In addition, German language courses  are 
provided for the young Mexicans. At the end of February 2014  
a further 46 young people joined them at the training center that 
Audi had built at the site.

In China, the Group will open yet another production plant by the 
end of 2014. By 2018 the number of employees in Chine is set to 
rise from around 75,000 to 100,000 as production capacity 
 increases to more than 4 million vehicles per year. At the same 
time, research and development resources are to be expanded to 
2,500 employees. Overall, and particularly through our Go West 
strategy (see page 38) in China we are helping create broad-based 
participation in prosperity and economic growth.
As our engineers in Germany supervise the construction of  the 
new factories and monitor component testing and quality assu r-
ance at our plants overseas, expansion abroad at the same time 
invariably helps safeguard jobs in Germany.
market exPansion in russia 
the Volkswagen Group is one of the largest foreign investors in the 
automotive industry in russia. our company Volkswagen Group rus 
brings together the activities of seven Group brands: Volkswagen 
passenger cars, audi, ŠKoda, seat, Volkswagen commercial Vehicles, 
Bentley and lamborghini in the russian market. Between 2006 and 
2013, a total of some €1.3 billion was invested in local production. 
By the end of 2018 we will be investing another €1.2 billion. in 
 november 2013 the 700,000th Volkswagen brand vehicle rolled off 
the production lines in Kaluga, where operations have created 
5,500 direct jobs and at least twice as many indirect ones. at the 
end of 2012 contract production also began at the nizhny novgorod 
plant of partner company GaZ, where 2,200 people are employed.

In Germany too the Volkswagen Group is providing new impetus 
for growth. Take Osnabrück for example, where we acquired the 
insolvent Wilhelm Karmann GmbH and in 2012 launched series 
production of the Porsche Boxter• and the Porsche Cayman•. In the 
meantime the plant has established itself as a center of excellence 
for cabriolets and small-series models. At the Group’s Wolfsburg 
site we have joined forces with the civic authorities to form 
Wolfsburg AG with the aim of promoting business in the region 
and at the same time improving the quality of life. In addition, the 
“Allianz für die Region” or Regional Alliance, which arose in 
 January 2013 out of a joint initiative between Wolfsburg AG and 
the REGION BRAUNSCHWEIG GMBH project, is striving to en-
hance local facilities for residents and businesses and to attract 
skilled labor to the area.

subsidies and taxes
For the expansion of its activities in the field of research and in the 
creation of new production plants, in 2013 the Volkswagen Group 
received €610 million in public subsidies. 
At the same time, thanks to its localization strategy, through taxes 
and duties the Volkswagen Group helps ensure that state and 
 municipal investments in infrastructure and public welfare are 
possible in many parts of the world. We pay taxes wherever we add 
value – the majority in Germany. In 2013 we paid the tax authori-
ties a total of around €3.1 billion in income tax alone.
suPPlier management
The Volkswagen Group fosters sustainability along the entire val-
ue chain, thereby ensuring stable and efficient flows of goods and 
supplies. With this in mind, in 2006 we formulated our Sustai n-
ability in Supplier Relations concept, which we have since been 
implementing step by step. 
 22 
It is based on four main pillars:
 > Sustainability requirements for direct suppliers (tier 1) that 
have to be acknowledged by all suppliers before submitting a 
quotation. Since November 12, 2013, in all agreements newly 
concluded by General Procurement, these have formed part of 
the General Terms and Conditions of Purchase and are thus 
 contractually integrated. 
 > An early warning system for identifying and minimizing risks 
along the supply chain.
 > Integration into the procurement process, for example by means 
of the sustainability questionnaire.
 > Supplier monitoring and development.
supplier requirements
Our supplier relations are based on the “Volkswagen Group 
 requirements regarding sustainability in its relationships with 
business partners (Code of Conduct for Business Partners)” 
which apply across the Group  (see page 37). Other binding parts 
of the contract include the Environmental Goals, as defined in 
VW Norm 01155 and VW Norm 99000. For example, when wood 
from rainforests is used a seal of approval from the Forest Stew-
ardship Council (FSC) must be provided. The requirements 
 apply to all outsourced goods and services worldwide. We expect 
our tier 1 suppliers to not only respect these requirements but 
also pass them on to their own suppliers. Our main suppliers are 
also required to put in place a certified environmental manage-
ment system in accordance with ISO 14001 or EMAS. Such sys-
tems have been verified or documented at 84% of our main sup-
pliers.
risk analysis
In order to obtain information about the importance attached    
to sustainability in the respective region before entering into 
 negotiations with potential suppliers, Volkswagen has performed 
a country risk analysis with the assistance of independent insti-
tutions. This analysis showed that there is an increased risk of 
non-compliance with our sustainability requirements in Brazil, 
India, China, Mexico and Russia. In 2013 this led to supplier 
 audits being conducted in India and Mexico. In 2014 these will be 
extended to other high-risk countries and groups of suppliers. 
With the introduction of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2014, the US 
 government is also intending to prevent armed groups in the 
 Congo benefiting from mineral mining and trade. The Act will 
 require disclosure of conflict minerals contained in products. The 
Volkswagen Group is not, however, directly affected by the Act.

In 2013 we signed up to the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EITI), which is supported by governments, NGOs,  in - 
vestors and businesses. The EITI aims to combat corruption by 
making payment flows related to raw materials transparent.  The 
Volkswagen Group also demonstrates a commitment to trans-
parency in the supply chain as a standing member of the UN Glo-
bal Compact Advisory Group on Supply Chain Sustainability. 
The Volkswagen Group subjects all potential new business part-
ners and suppliers to an integrity check (Business Partner 
Check), thereby reducing the risk of a relationship that could 
 adversely affect the Group and its business. In 2013 this business 
partner check was carried out in respect of more than 12,000 
potential new suppliers worldwide.

Procurement risk management 
the risk management system in the procurement sector constantly 
monitors and analyzes the financial stability of our suppliers. a 
suite of different measures help to largely eliminate supply risks 
due to the failure of suppliers. in addition, suitable measures are 
 applied to minimize the financial effects of crises and insolvencies 
in the supply chain. 
in the interests of effective prevention, all Group suppliers are 
 included in the pool of suppliers who are basically to be monitored. 
if there is evidence pointing to a risk, a detailed risk analysis is 
drawn up for the supplier in question. depending on the outcome, 
the supplier is assigned to one of three risk categories (low, medium 
or high risk). this assessment is arrived at by evaluation of all risks 
that could endanger the contractually agreed supply process.
the risk analysis and evaluation process takes account of indus-
try-specific factors in line with four key indicators taken from pro fit-
and-loss, financial and balance-sheet analysis and collected over 
several years. along with figures from the past, the analysis also 
takes account of current performance and budgeted figures. as a 
rule, such analyses are updated annually. 
to arrive at an appraisal of the stability of Group suppliers that is as 
comprehensive as possible, product-related risks are also analyzed, 
as are the material groups concerned, the relevant market in each 
case, the supplier/competition situation in the respective market 
and the strategic development of the supplier. in addition, the de-
velopment of external creditworthiness ratings is also monitored 
for all Group suppliers. this indicator is updated every two weeks 
and also serves as an early warning mechanism. 
if evidence emerges that the stability of a supplier is threatened, 
 appropriate measures are taken to assess, evaluate and avoid or 
minimize possible supply risks. this means analyzing supply flows 
across the Group and coordinating activities with all of the procure-
ment functions concerned at the Group brands and regions.
integration in the Procurement Process
To become a business partner of the Volkswagen Group, our 
suppliers must first register on the Group Business Platform and 
then complete the following process:
 > Sustainability requirements: Before submitting a quotation, 
the supplier must acknowledge the sustainability requirements. 
Since November 12, 2013, for all suppliers to General Procure-
ment, the requirements have been contractually integrated as 
part of the General Terms and Conditions of Purchase. 
 > Sustainability questionnaire: In the course of the business 
process, the supplier is required to complete a sustainability 
questionnaire: by December 31, 2013, 11,749 tier 1 suppliers 
had done so. In terms of procurement volume that equates to 
82%. 
 > E-Learning: In the interests of continuing supplier develop-
ment, in the course of our business relations we make available 
45
45
to all suppliers an electronic learning module in eight languag-
es, including Chinese and Russian. After completing this task, 
the supplier has to perform a self-check. The sustainability 
learning module is not regarded as “passed” until this check 
is successfully completed. By the end of 2013, 8,652 tier 1 sup-
pliers had successfully completed the E-Learning module, 
which equates to 50% in terms of procurement volume. 
training tool For all suPPlier emPloYees 
since october 2013, the Volkswagen Group’s e-learning tool has 
also been available to suppliers to raise awareness among an unlim-
ited number of their employees. By way of example, over 100 
employees of supplier reGe motorenteile learned about our sus-
tain ability requirements on the Group Business platform.
supplier monitoring
If we receive information or our early warning system gives rea-
son to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their suppliers are failing to 
comply with our sustainability requirements or the answers to 
our  sustainability questionnaire are not satisfactory, we ask the 
party concerned for a written statement using a standardized 6D 
 Report. Based on the six points in the report, they can describe the 
status quo and any remedial measures. If the answers again prove 
unsatisfactory, we take further appropriate steps, such as the ex-
amination of documents, visits to the supplier’s premises or other 
customized supplier development activities. These measures are 
coordinated by an ad-hoc expert team in Wolfsburg together with 
expert teams from the relevant brands and regions. Depending on 
the situation, experts from specialist areas such as Occupational 
Health and Safety or Human Resources may also be called in. In 
2013 there were 29 ad-hoc cases in all, eight of which involved tier 
2 suppliers. Eleven cases occurred in Europe, 13 in Asia, four in 
North and South America and one in Africa. The increase com-
pared to the previous year is due not least to the fact that quality 
process auditors and field service staff from Procured Component 
Management are continuously being made more aware of the need 
to look out for non-compliance by suppliers. 
Sustainability courses have been integrated into the curriculum 
at the procurement academies at the various production sites and 
also take place at specialist department level. At the Wolfsburg 
site, for example, some 1,200 employees from Procurement, 
 Qua l  ity Assurance, Compliance and related specialist depart-
ments were trained in 15 separate courses.
The internal and external point of contact for suspected cases of 
non-compliance with our sustainability requirements, particu-
larly where violations of human rights in the supply chain are con-
cerned, is the email address: sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com. 
In addition, internal and external parties can address possible 
cases of non-compliance via national and international employee 
representation bodies (such as the General and Group Works 
Councils or the European and World Works Councils) and the 
 national and international trade union federations (such as IG Metall 
or IndustriALL).
audits and on-site inspections
The focus throughout all process steps and measures is on fair dia-
logue in a spirit of partnership and on development of the supplier 
in the interests of long-term collaboration. At the same time, the 
Volkswagen Group reserves the right to have compliance with the 
sustainability requirements verified by experts at the supplier’s 
premises during regular business hours. In the event of non-com-
pliance with the sustainability requirements we will, however, 
terminate business relations particularly if the supplier shows no 
interest in long-term improvement. No such case occurred during 
the reporting period.
In the monitoring process, the Procurement function is also 
 supported by our field service staff. In particular, in the course of 
their supplier audits, the quality process auditors focus on whether 
the supplier has answered the sustainability questionnaire and 
understood the contents, and they inform Procurement if this is 
not the case. The next step is to launch an escalation process which 
includes the use of the 6D Report.

supplier training courses 
As in previous years, workshops or sustainability training courses 
were staged in various regions in the reporting period with and for 
local suppliers. In June 2013, for example, Volkswagen Argentina 
met up with its 45 largest suppliers for an exchange of ideas and 
concepts as to how sustainability could together be realized along 
the value chain. The aim was to arrive at a common under-  
stan ding of the various ecological and social challenges involved. 
In São Paulo (Brazil), Volkswagen do Brasil organized a workshop 
with some 70 strategically important suppliers. Using examples of 
best practices they discussed the practical implementation of 
 sustainability requirements and prepared the ground for ancho r-
ing responsible business processes in the strategic planning of 
the business partners.  
Also in 2013, as part of the “Automotive Industry Action Group” 
and “European Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain 
Sustainability” initiatives in which we are involved, training 
courses for tier 1 suppliers were held in Mexico, Brazil and 
 Romania. These focused on basic requirements such as occu-
pational safety and environmental protection, adapted in each 
case to the local legal context. Here, together with other auto-
mobile manufactu rers, 129 persons from 87 Volkswagen Group 
suppliers were given training in respect of sustainability re-
quirements. They were also encouraged to pass on the lessons 
learned to their own sup pliers. 
 23 
status Quo and outlook 
One central goal for 2013 was the integration of the Porsche, 
Scania, MAN and Ducati brands into the “Sustainability in Sup-
plier Relations” concept, a goal that – subject to implementation of 
individual elements – we were able to meet. We also expanded our 
supplier monitoring and training as planned. We are aiming to 
continue with this in 2014 as well as making our E-Learning tool 
available to the employees of additional tier 1 suppliers. Our aim in 
this respect in 2014 is to reach 70% (procurement volume-based) 
coverage for the E-Learning tool and 88% for our sustainability 
questionnaire among tier 1 suppliers.
Our core concern is to ensure that the sustainability requirements 
are integrated into all of the Group’s agreements. Since January 
2014 the sustainability requirements have been integrated into 
the agreements with suppliers of production material. At the same 
time we are also planning to expand our external CSR audits as 
well as CSR training for our direct suppliers. 
training courses were held for  
tier 1  suppliers in Mexico, Brazil and 
Romania.

comPliance 
In the long term, a company can only be successful if it acts with 
integrity, complies with statutory provisions worldwide and stands 
by its voluntary undertakings and ethical principles even when 
this is the harder choice. Our Compliance organization supports 
this approach.  
our understanding oF comPliance 
at Volkswagen, compliance means playing by the rules. it is a corner-
stone of sustainable business – a view expressly shared by the com-
pany’s management. speaking to an audience of more than 5,000 at 
a management event in 2013, chairman of the Board of manage-
ment of the Volkswagen Group, prof. dr. martin Winterkorn, em-
phasized this point: “operating a sustainable business means we 
continue to take the subject of compliance seriously. We do not 
break the law, or other rules and regulations! this applies to all 
our brands and in all regions. Volkswagen enjoys an excellent 
 re p utation internationally. it is our responsibility as managers to 
ensure that it is upheld.” other members of the Group Board of 
management and brand boards of management also called on 
the workforce to comply with the rules over the course of the 
past fiscal year.
We adopt a preventive compliance approach and foster a corporate 
culture that stops potential breaches before they occur. Group 
 Internal Audit and Group Security as well as the Human Resour ces 
and Group Legal departments are responsible for the necessary 
investigative measures and responses. The guidelines laid down 
in the Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct are of essential impor-
tance here. These have been communicated at all consolidated 
brand companies and can be accessed by all Group employees via 
the Volkswagen portal.
14 chief compliance officers,  
175 compliance officers and  
500 employees in 49 countries    
safeguard our integrity.
The Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the 
Chairman of the Group Board of Management. He is supported 
in his work by 14 Chief Compliance Officers who are responsible 
for the brands, the Financial Services Division and Porsche 
Holding GmbH, Salzburg (Austria), as well as some 175 Compli-
ance Officers in the Group companies. Compliance forms an inte-
gral part of the Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) organiza-
tion in which around 500 employees are currently employed in 49 
countries. Networking of the organization is regularly promoted 
by measures including regional workshops. 
compliance risk assessment
The risk management system, the internal audit system and the 
compliance management system are closely interlinked through 
the Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) approach. Potential 
compliance risks are identified and assessed by the standard GRC 
process that is in place across the Group. As a result, in the report-
ing year some 2,000 assessments of potential compliance risks 
and the relevant remedial measures were reported across the 
Group. More specifically, these included risk assessments on the 
topics of anti-corruption, competition law and antitrust law. Based 
on the findings, preventive measures are drawn up and the appro-
priate compliance programs defined. In 2013 more than 500 tests 
were staged to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures.
expansion of compliance in 2013
Compliance activities in 2013 focused on expanding the GRC orga-
nization and on anti-corruption measures in China. To this end a 
China Compliance conference was held in Beijing in May 2013. 
The conference provided an opportunity to train the local manage-
ment, assess the specific situation in China from a compliance 
perspective and develop future local compliance strategies in 
workshops. In addition, at German companies measures were in-
troduced to prevent money laundering. These comply with the new 
requirements of the Geldwäschegesetz (GwG – German Money 
Laundering Act), which came into force in 2012. In the reporting 
year, risk-based training on competition and antitrust law was 
provided for employees in Germany and abroad.
Compliance is integrated into a variety of operational processes. 
For example, since 2010, all new employment contracts entered 
into between Volkswagen AG on the one part and both manage-
ment staff and employees covered by collective agreements on the 
other have included a reference to the Code of Conduct and the 
 obligation to comply with it. The integrity of Volkswagen Group 
suppliers is systematically examined through a Business Partner 
Check based on the “Volkswagen Group requirements regarding 
sustainability in its relationships with business partners (Code of 
Conduct for business partners)” (see also page 37).
Prevention through information and training
To raise employee awareness of compliance-related issues we  use 
both traditional communication channels such as employee 
 ma gazines and information stands, and electronic media such as 
 intranet portals, apps, blogs, audio-podcasts and online news-
letters. Information events for employees at all levels of the hier-
archy are a particularly important means of communication. In 
2013 over 200,000 employees across the Group took part in 4,319 
classroom and online courses on the topics of compliance in 
 general, money laundering, the Code of Conduct, competition and 
antitrust legislation, human rights and combatting corruption. 
Online E-Learning programs and classroom training are firmly

anchored in existing corporate processes. At Volkswagen AG, for 
example, completion of the online training module on the Code of 
Conduct has been mandatory for all new employees since July 1, 
2012.
Employees of all brand companies and a large number of Group 
companies are able to obtain personal advice about compliance 
issues, usually by contacting the compliance organization via a 
dedicated e-mail address.

checks, audits and sanctions  
Group Internal Audit and Group Security regularly and systemati-
cally monitor compliance with the rules, carrying out random 
checks irrespective of any suspicion of non-compliance and in-
vestigating whenever breaches are actually suspected. The world-
wide ombudsman system in place since 2006 can be used to report 
any breaches or suspicions (particularly regarding corruption) in 
nine different languages to two external lawyers appointed by the 
Group. Naturally, the people providing the information need not 
fear being punished by the Company for doing so. In 2013, the 
 ombudsmen passed on 30 reports by people – whose details re-
mained confidential if requested – to the Volkswagen Group’s 
 Anti-Corruption Officer, the Head of Group Internal Audit. In 
 addition, the Anti-Corruption Officer received information on a 
further 65 cases directly. During local internal audits of the 
brands and Group companies, 251 reports of suspected fraud were 
submitted. 
 24
over 200,000 employees  attended 
compliance training in 2013.
 
All information is followed up. All breaches of the law or internal 
regulations are appropriately punished. In 2013 action was taken 
against a total of 101 employees across the Volkswagen Group as  a 
result of findings of investigations based on information received. 
In 54 of these cases worldwide, the employee’s contract was 
 terminated. Moreover, during the reporting year, five contracts 
with business partners were terminated or not renewed because of 
infringements related to corruption.
The basis for the auditing program of Group Internal Audit and  
of 19 other local audit functions at the brands and affiliated com-
panies is provided by a risk-oriented assessment of the Group’s 
core business processes. In the process, all Volkswagen Group 
com panies are systematically classified in terms of risks which, 
from the point of view of the auditors, are relevant to the audit. The 
 topics with the highest risk levels are integrated into the auditing 
programs. In 2013 a total of 1,745 audits were conducted at 246 
companies (including Volkswagen AG). Among other things, the 
audits cover internal control mechanisms for the prevention of 
corruption (four-eye principle, segregation of functions), the 
 existence of compliance guidelines and preventive measures. In 
addition, Group Internal Audit has set up a Continuous Monito r-
ing unit. This is tasked not least with supporting the documen-
tation of the effectiveness of the internal control system, based  
on structured data analysis of financial and/or other upstream 
systems. Further information on compliance at the Volkswagen 
Group can be found in our current Annual Report.

ratings and indexes 
The ratings awarded by sustainability-oriented investors, ana-
lysts and rating agencies are an important measure of success 
for the Volkswagen Group as it pursues its strategy. At the same 
time,  good marks for sustainability also make our shares more 
attractive. The fact that, in September 2013, we became global 
sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index with 89 out of 
a possible 100 points, documents our systematic efforts across all 
areas – from environmental protection to corporate governance. 
In November 2013 we were awarded the German Investors 
Award for Responsible Business, presented by Deutsche Asset & 
Wealth Management (DeAWM) and publishing house DuMont 
Verlag. The award analyses the performance of 175 listed com-
panies in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
factors.
global sector leader in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index. 
Moreover, the Volkswagen Group was also listed in the Global 
Compact 100 index launched in 2013. Compiled by the UN Glo bal 
Compact in partnership with the rating agency Sustainaly tics, 
the new index comprises particularly responsibly managed 
companies that also demonstrate sound profitability. In order to 
qualify for the index, companies must have been signatories to 
the Global Compact for at least one year, be listed on the world’s 
leading share indexes and have returned a positive EBIT for the 
three years preceding the annual index review. The  Norwegian 
pension fund Storebrand, one of the largest in the world, also 
lists the Volkswagen Group among the world’s 100 most sustain-
able companies.
In 2013 we were listed for the first time in both CDP indexes, the 
CDP Global 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and the CDP 
Global 500 Climate Performance Leadership Index. These listings 
honor both our transparency (Disclosure) and our successes 
(Performance) in the field of climate protection and led to us be-
ing presented with the Performance category award at the annu-
al CDP Conference in November 2013. The Volkswagen Group 
can point to a growing number of investors who base their ac ti v-
ities on sustainability criteria. These include some 100 Europe-
an mu tual funds that apply social and ecological criteria. The 
largest  institutional investors in Europe include the Norwegian 
and Swedish pension funds. In all, in 2012 some 20% of the free 
float of Volkswagen shares was in the hands of investors with  a 
focus on sustainability.

QuaLIFICaTION
Throughout their working lives our employees 
are qualified within the “Berufsfamilien” 
 (professional families). One key underlying 
principle here is knowledge transfer from our 
own experts. Qualification follows the 
dual model, which involves close 
 coordination between theory and 
practice
Taking responsibility
Dual moDel of 
 vocational eDucation  
anD training 
Since 2012 SEAT has been offering the dual model of vocational education and training at its Martorell plant in Spain. Along with  
in-depth theoretical qualification, 1,700 hours of hands-on experience at the company are included in the three-year curriculum.  
Top-class vocational education and training is an essential part of delivering high 
quality and outstanding performance. Our standards in this respect are high – not 
only in Germany, but around the globe. We are bringing the proven dual model – 
based on the close integration of theoretical and practical forms of learning – to all 
our sites.
PEOPLE
Focus on Spain
Iván Vendrell quickly crosses the workshop at the SEAT 
vocational school to join his fellow students. In the hall next door, 
Débora Ocaña stands in front of a machine tool that she has just 
programmed, tracking its movements and making notes. “Per-
fect. Exactly how I wanted it to work.” The sparkle in her eyes shows 
just how pleased she is. You only need to watch Débora and Iván on 
this completely ordinary Wednesday morning to see the passion 
they bring to their work. They are proud to be learning their trade 
at SEAT.
This applies in particular to 17-year-old Iván, who is qualifying to 
be a motor vehicle mechatronics technician. He is one of the first 
young people to have started a dual model of vocational education 
and training at SEAT. In September 2012, the car-maker became 
the first large company in Spain to introduce this successful mod-
el, which combines theory and plenty of practice. In the past, the 
standard three-year apprenticeship at SEAT included 600 hours of 
practical instruction. Now the training involves 1,700 hours of 
work at the company and in its qualification workshops. This al-
lows Iván and the other apprentices to gain experience in their fu-
ture professions at an early stage. And it is rounded off by another 
600 hours of project-based training in which they work on orders 
for in-house customers.
SEaT’s new vocational education and training program also 
gives apprentices more time to try out what they have learned, and 
that is motivating. Electronics apprentice Débora is fascinated by 
the technology involved in modern automobile production. She 
likes to tinker and wants to know exactly how everything works. 
“Although I knew in theory how robotic welding worked, I only re-
ally understood it here on the shop floor.” 
Iván too feels most at home in the workshop. He proudly points to 
the small metal stairs he milled in the third week of his appren-
ticeship. They are a testament to the meticulousness and dedica-
tion with which Iván is preparing for his career. He approaches his 
second great passion – breakdancing – in just the same way. Each 
step, each turn has to be perfect. He regularly meets friends after 
work to learn new moves and styles.
Many of his friends wish they had an apprenticeship like 
Iván’s. Spain has the second-highest youth unemployment rate in 
Europe. The Spanish government is supporting the new dual 
 model of vocational education and training by allowing the ap-
prentices to be integrated into production operations at the plant. 
This was previously not possible. Students at vocational schools 
could only gain practical experience through internships. Today, 
the work entrusted to SEAT’s apprentices includes producing 
 special parts for the model making department.
For SEAT and the  Volkswagen Group, sound qualifications are 
first and foremost an investment in their own competitiveness. 
That is why the carmaker is exporting the dual model of vocational 
training and education system to all its locations around the world 
– China, India, and the USA are joining the twelve European coun-
tries that have already rolled out the program. At SEAT in Spain a 
total of 167 young people began their apprenticeship in line with 
the new curriculum in 2013. 
The launch of the dual system was accompanied by the introduction 
of the remuneration policy practiced in Germany, which has differ-
ent pay grades for apprentices in different years of their training.
SEAT is planning to offer permanent employment with the compa-
ny to all its apprentices who successfully complete the course.
167 young people are currently 
engaged in the dual model of 
 vocational education and training 
at SEAT. 
For Débora and Javier, memories of their first exciting days as ap-
prentices are not quite as fresh. Débora, a confident 22-year-old, 
is already in the third year of her apprenticeship. She was a little 
nervous about her first hands-on experience on the production 
line at the plant. So she was glad that, like all apprentices at SEAT, 
she could rely on the advice and support of her mentor. 
Débora will also be one of the first to sit two exams in 2014 in line 
with Spanish and German guidelines (the latter in conjunction 
with the German Chamber of Commerce). This way she will end up 
with a dual qualification that again underlines the quality of the 
training she has received.
Last year, 20-year-old Javier Sánchez completed his training as an 
industrial mechanic and toolmaker. Now he speaks from experi-
ence as an employee at the press shop in Barcelona when he says: 
“We learn faster than other apprentices because we specialize 
earlier – that’s an unbeatable advantage in the world of work.” 
This smart young man is not the first skilled mechanic in the 
family. His father runs a small machine shop and taught Javier 
how to handle tools as a boy. These days, though, it is Javier who 
gives his father tips as they talk shop about the quality of the vari-
ous tools, and sometimes he even helps finance a new addition to 
his father’s array of tools. 
“The dual model of vocational education and training is a real 
boon for us. The close link between theory and hands-on practice 
ensures that our future employees have a high level of expertise”, 
says Manuel Moreno, who is responsible for initial and in-service 
training at SEAT Personnel Management. But it’s not just SEAT 
that benefits – quality vocational education and training for  its 
young people ultimately also strengthens Spain’s industry as a 
whole.

MaNaGEMENT aPPROaCH
Securing excellent performance, generating success and enabling 
employees to share in the profits are central to the  Volkswagen 
Group’s personnel management (PM) strategy. The key aims of the 
Group’s PM work are, therefore, qualifying our employees, pro-
moting their health and fitness, and ensuring that they are in-
volved. We are explicitly committed to diversity within the Compa-
ny and support it through open attitudes, equal opportunities, and 
the targeted advancement of women. 
Challenges and Goals
The increasingly international nature of the  Volkswagen Group 
and its complexity are the key challenges facing our PM work. Only 
a top team can deliver the outstanding performance that is re-
quired to make  Volkswagen the top global automotive manufac-
turer. So, more than ever before, we need to promote talent across 
all areas. Our aim for the coming years is to continue to develop 
our employees’ existing high skills levels and problem-solving 
abilities. Vocational education and training and study form the ba-
sis for skills development within  Volkswagen’s “Berufsfamilien” 
(professional families). Building on this basis, our employees con-
tinue to learn and develop their skills throughout their working 
lives. Knowledge transfer – the passing on of knowledge and expe-
rience by our own specialists – is a key part of our strategy. Qualifi-
cation takes place in line with the dual model, which integrates 
theoretical learning with practical training. 
underpinning our basic principles 
with equal opportunities and equal 
treatment.
 
Policies and Guidelines 
As a global undertaking with 106 manufacturing plants across 
 Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, we are committed to 
 respect, tolerance and cosmopolitanism.   Volkswagen guarantees 
equal opportunities and equal treatment regardless of ethnicity, 
skin color, gender, disability, ideology, faith, nationality, sexual 
orientation, social background, or political conviction, provided 
this is based on democratic principles and tolerance towards those 
who hold different views. 
The following documents constitute the framework for personnel 
management across the  Volkswagen Group and apply worldwide:
 > The   Volkswagen Code of Conduct: The Code came into opera-
tion in 2010 and creates the framework for lawful and ethical 
behavior (see page 18). 
 8
 > The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
 Volkswagen (Social Charter): In 2002,  Volkswagen used this 
Declaration to document the basic social rights and principles 
that underpin its corporate identity. The social rights and princi-
ples set out in the Declaration are based on relevant Internation-
al Labour Organization Conventions (see page 18). 
 25
 > The Charter on Labour Relations: The Charter came into 
force in autumn 2009 and combines wide-ranging rights 
to consultation with shared responsibilities. It provides for 
rights to information, consultation and codetermination for 
employee representatives in the brands, companies and loca-
tions represented on the Group Global Works Council (see 
page 66). 
 26
 > The Charter on Temporary Work: In November 2012, Group 
management, the European Works Council and the Group 
Global Works Council agreed a Charter on Temporary Work, 
which sets out the principles for managing temporary work 
(see page 67).

EXCELLENCE. SuCCESS.  
INVOLVEMENT.
Successfully tackling the current and future challenges facing the  Volkswagen Group depends on 
all our employees – from apprentices right up to top managers – consistently turning in an 
 outstanding performance to ensure that our innovation and product quality remain at the very 
highest level in the long term. That means recruiting talent and promoting skills, health and 
 commitment. But it also means enabling our employees to play their part in building our success – 
and share in it. And it’s how we plan to achieve our goal of becoming the most attractive 
 employer in the automobile industry by 2018.

Employment Trends in 2013
Including the Chinese joint ventures, the  Volkswagen Group em-
ployed a total of 572,800 people on December 31, 2013 – 4.2% 
more than at the end of 2012. Significant factors in this increase 
were the volume-related expansion of the workforce in growth 
markets, in particular in China, and the recruitment of specialists 
and experts in Germany and elsewhere. In 2013,  Volkswagen AG, 
 Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, AUDI AG and  Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG put a total of 4,828 temporary workers on permanent 
contracts; MAN and Porsche took 543 temporary employees into 
the core workforce in Germany.
GROuP aND BRaNDS RaNkED TOP EMPLOYERS
In 2013, we secured leading positions in a number of employer 
rankings. A survey among Europe’s future IT experts and engineers 
by the consultancy company trendence, for example, saw the 
 Volkswagen Group improve its ranking from fourth to second most 
attractive employer in Europe. In two further trendence surveys, 
more than 320,000 graduates in engineering, IT and business 
 studies from a total of 24 European countries voted the Group “Best 
 employer in the automotive sector”, while Audi was voted the most 
popular employer by engineering and business studies graduates 
for the fourth consecutive year. The  Volkswagen brand was ranked 
third by business studies graduates and fourth by engineers in the 
same survey. We achieved similar positive results in other countries, 
too, including Brazil, China, Mexico, Poland and South Africa.

QuaLIFICaTION WITHIN THE BERuFSFaMILIEN
To ensure that employees in all our locations maintain an out-
standing level of qualification, we need individual qualification 
and personnel development across the “Berufsfamilien” (profes-
sional families) that make up the  Volkswagen Group. 
A Berufsfamilie includes all employees with related specialist 
skills who work together, regardless of their level of experience or 
development. Learning and teaching involve the Company’s own 
experts, and learning processes are tailored to specific working 
processes and the technical skills requirements of the relevant 
 Berufsfamilie.
Shared learning is being continuously developed and extended 
within   Volkswagen as more and more Berufsfamilien set up their 
own Academy to provide qualification. In January 2013, the 
Group launched the “ Volkswagen Group Academy” to serve as 
the umbrella body for all the Academies within the Group. It 
was formed following the reintegration of  Volkswagen Coaching 
GmbH and its merger with the AutoUni. The reorganization 
 creates a qualification network spanning initial vocational edu-
cation and training up to academic in-service qualification 
that exploits synergies to ensure high skills levels and quality 
standards across the Group.
Group-wide “Personnel Management 
Academy” established.
Vocational Education and Training in Line with the Dual 
Model
Vocational education and training in line with the dual model 
underpin the  Volkswagen Group’s efforts to build a top team. In 
December 2013, the number of employees in vocational educa-
tion and training within the Group totaled 17,703 worldwide, 
 including 12,611 in Germany – a record number.   Volkswagen AG 
alone offers training in a total of 30 professions and on 19 courses 
to apprentices and students on combined practical and theoretical 
courses within the Company. Hands-on experience days offer 
young people an opportunity to find out more and are held at 
 Volkswagen AG, among other locations. 
 30 
The dual model of vocational education and training has now been 
adopted at many sites outside Germany, with others developing the 
system. Over three quarters of all apprentices within the Group 
are currently being trained in line with this tried-and-tested sys-
tem, including those in Spain, Hungary, Russia, the USA, Mexico, 
India and China.
Dual vocational training began at   Volkswagen’s Kaluga plant in 
Russia in 2010, and since 2012, the plant has added the role of 
warehouse logistics operator to its existing training professions 
(motor vehicle mechatronic, construction and production me-
chanic, automotive painter, and general mechatronic technician). 
Since 2011,  Volkswagen has also been training general mecha-
tronic technicians to German standards at its Indian plant in 
Pune. The “ Volkswagen India Academy” collaborates with the 
 local Industrial Training Institute to provide this training. 
In May 2013,  Volkswagen Group South Africa was commended for 
its ongoing commitment to initial and continuing qualification 
in the context of South Africa’s most important empowerment 
awards.
In 2012, SEAT switched its vocational education and training sys-
tem in Spain over to the dual model and has, since then, integrated 
the facility more closely as a training location. This was made pos-
sible by a reform of local education and training legislation, boost-
ing the practical element within training programs, which had 
previously had a stronger academic focus. And in summer 2013, 
Audi began training the first apprenticeship year of young skilled 
workers for its new San José Chiapa plant in Mexico, which is 
scheduled to come on stream in 2016. In Hungary and China, the 
Company is already making use of the tried-and-tested combina-
tion of theoretical learning and practice-based training. A further 
pilot project is currently under way at the Belgian location in 
 Brussels.
DuaL MODEL OF VOCaTIONaL EDuCaTION 
aND TRaINING WORLDWIDE
In 2013 the first apprenticeship year of twelve apprentices complet-
ed the dual model of vocational education and training for mecha-
tronic technicians at the  Volkswagen Chattanooga plant (USA). 
Along with the course for industrial mechatronic technicians, in 
2012 a program for motor vehicle mechatronic technicians was 
launched. Another technical qualification model is currently being 
drawn up and there are plans for a commercial version as well. At 
present, 61 young people are being trained at Chattanooga. The ap-
prentices rotate through six different stations in the plant, receiv-
ing instruction from skilled workers. The theory modules, which 
make up some 30% of the vocational education and training, are 
taught by teachers from Chattanooga State Community College 
with whom the Company cooperates. Instruction takes place at the 
 Volkswagen Qualification Academy, located in the grounds of the 
plant. Investments in the qualification facility alone have totaled 
USD 40 million. After passing their final examination, the apprentic-
es in Chattanooga not only receive a German “Facharbeiterbrief” 
(skilled worker’s certificate), but also a college diploma that would 
allow them to continue their studies at university. In addition to a 
hiring guarantee in their specialized area,  Volkswagen also offers 
them attractive benefits, a Bachelor’s degree program and oppor-
tunities to gain international experience within the Group. 
In Chattanooga, instruction began even before the first vehicle 
rolled off the assembly lines, because well-qualified skilled workers 
are hard to find in the USA. There is no institutionalized vocational 
education and training system in the USA; new workers usually just 
receive on-the-job training. That is why other German companies 
too are using the dual model of vocational education and training 
at their US plants. The special thing about the vocational education 
and training offered by  Volkswagen is that it is so far the only 
61
 program in the USA to be recognized by the German Chamber of 
 Industry and Commerce and the German American Chamber of Com-
merce. At the heart of the model is the conviction that outstanding 
quality results from consistently high professional standards (qualifi-
cation level). And so the  Volkswagen Group’s aim is to roll out this 
successful model at all its production sites outside Germany. 
a YEaR’S SuPPORT FOR YOuNG PEOPLE 
A new initiative at Porsche in 2013 was the “Förderjahr” (A year’s 
support) scheme, a program governed by collective agreement that 
offers young people with social, academic, or other difficulties the 
opportunity to undergo formal skills training. Over a period of ten 
months, participants take part in a skills development program that 
prepares them for a standard vocational training program. Nine of 
the eleven participants were able to complete the program success-
fully and began conventional vocational training in September 2013.
aPPRENTICE INVOLVEMENT IN THE auSCHWITz
MEMORIaL aND MuSEuM 
 Volkswagen is deeply committed to its apprentices’ involvement 
with the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum, which is recognized 
around the world. The scheme has been running for more than 20 
years. Six times a year, groups of  Volkswagen AG apprentices travel 
to Auschwitz to spend two weeks working with young Poles at the 
Memorial and Museum; since 2012, apprentices from subsidiaries 
and affiliated companies have also been involved in the scheme. 
More than 2,400 young Germans and Poles have so far taken part in 
this program. At the General Works Council’s initiative, the commit-
ment has been broadened substantially, and since 2008, separate 
groups of managers, management trainees and Meister (group 
leaders) have also been involved.
In November 2013, the the Group Board of Management and the Group Global Works Council held the 13th award ceremony for the Group’s top 
 apprentices around the world. Nine women and 31 men from 20 occupations and 15 different countries won the “Best Apprentice Award”.

Programs for Young Skilled Workers
 Volkswagen AG promotes future generations of skilled workers 
through its “talent groups”. “Talent groups” for young skilled 
workers enable us to support particularly talented employees on 
their transition from training to professional work. This two-year 
training and development program recruits the best 10% of ap-
prentices from each apprenticeship year, with an emphasis on the 
individual development of technical excellence.
The  Volkswagen Group promotes intercultural understanding be-
tween young employees through a program enabling them to work 
abroad, known as the “Wanderjahre” (years abroad) program – 
the name alludes to the tradition among newly-qualified crafts-
men of traveling the world and gaining experience. Since 2006, 
young people at the start of their career have had the opportunity, 
on completion of their training, to spend 12 months working 
for a Group company outside their home country. A total of 35 
 Volkswagen Group companies in 19 countries are now involved in 
this development program, with MAN Türkiye A.S¸. in Ankara 
 joining the scheme for the first time in 2013 by hosting one parti-
cipant. So far, almost 400 young employees have taken up this 
 opportunity, and in 2013, 55 participants from Germany and 12 
from a further five countries spent twelve months at one of the 
Group’s international locations. 
Developing Graduates 
 Volkswagen recruits and develops young graduates though the 
Student Talent Bank and the Academic Talent Pool.   Volkswagen AG 
has been using the Student Talent Bank since 1998 to bring on par-
ticularly able students in workplace-related and cross-functional 
areas. Almost 2,300 students who have demonstrated outstanding 
technical and personal abilities during their internship at 
 Volkswagen have now been included in the Student Talent Bank. 
 Volkswagen supports these former interns while they complete 
their studies, for example by inviting them to lectures and presen-
tations, seminars, and trips to  Volkswagen sites. Shortly before 
they graduate or complete their doctorate, these talented students 
are then moved into the Academic Talent Pool, which provides the 
Company with a way to identify individuals with potential for 
 graduate-level entry into a specialized area within  Volkswagen.
In 2013 alone,   Volkswagen AG alone recruited a total of 360 
 graduates, of whom around 30% were female. The StartUp Direct 
and StartUp Cross trainee programs give university students a 
head start within the Company. Over a two-year period, partici-
pants in the StartUp Direct program not only work within their 
own department and familiarize themselves with the Company 
but also have the opportunity to attend additional qualification 
programs. The program also includes placements of a few weeks in 
production and an optional foreign placement. University gradu-
ates with an international focus may opt for the StartUp Cross 
 program instead. This 18-month international program includes 
a three-month international placement. Over 2,700 trainees have 
acquired their initial experience with  Volkswagen on one of these 
two programs since they were launched. 
Many graduates in southern Europe are currently experiencing 
difficulty in finding employment despite having excellent skills. 
Since 2012, our StartUp Europe program has been offering

there. On completing the two-year program, they may be offered 
permanent employment. Since the initiative was launched in 
2012, no fewer than 5,700 young people have applied for the 67 
places on the program.
Qualifying Every Employee
The  Volkswagen Group Academy run by  Volkswagen AG offers em-
ployees a wide range of skills development measures, including 
personnel development programs, cross-functional seminars and 
courses and specialized qualification programs geared to the  
specific requirements of individual Berufsfamilien. The dual 
model of vocational training underpins the Academy’s offering, 
acknowledging that close coordination between theoretical 
learning and practice-based qualification is the best way to en-
sure that employees continue to develop their specialist skills 
throughout their working lives.
During 2013, a total of 86,316 participants benefited from 10,060 
qualification programs organized by the   Volkswagen Group Acad-
emy, representing 213,678 participant-days. In the area of spe-
cialist skills development (e.g. factory automation, robotics and 
applications engineering or management), 56,554 participants 
attended 7,591 seminars over 126,976 participant-days. Mean-
while, in the field of “cross-functional skills development” (which 
includes leadership skills and personal development), 29,762 
participants attended 2,469 courses, representing 86,702 par-
ticipant-days. 369 new programs and courses were developed 
over the course of the reporting year to ensure that the Com-
pany’s in- service qualification provision continues to meet its 
needs.
The creation and development of Berufsfamilie Academies means 
that sites outside Germany are increasingly involved in this quali-
fication model, for example via the “Beschaffungsakademie” 
(Procurement Academy) at ŠKODA in the Czech Republic, the 
“Akademie der Qualitätssicherung“ (Quality Assurance Academy) 
in Mexico and the “Produktakademie” (Product Academy) in 
 China. Brandspecific qualification provision is complemented, 
optimized and extended by cross-brand provision. 
86,316 employees attended 10,060 
qualification programs.
 
The Group-wide “Personnel Management Academy” was set up in 
mid-2013 for employees in the Personnel Management Berufs-
familie. It was followed, in late 2013, by the “Finanzakademie” 
(Finance Academy), the Group-wide “Logistikakademie” (Logis-
tics Academy), and the “Academy of Communications”. A further 
new Academy is the “FS Akademie” (FS Academy), in which 
 Volkswagen Financial Services AG brings together its qualifica-
tion activities and expert knowledge.
Further Development in Leadership and Management 
Initial and in-service qualification for Meister is a particular 
priority for the   Volkswagen Group. Meister qualifications are 
currently being brought into line with uniform worldwide 
 standards. A Group Leader Qualification prepares the Meister 
of tomorrow for their role as production managers. Qualifica-
tion has already been standardized at Group locations in India, 
 Poland and Russia, and 322 Meister completed their qualifica-
tion at  Volkswagen in 2013, including 84 outside Germany.
Meanwhile,   Volkswagen prepares its future supervisors for 
their leadership role by means of Basic Leadership Qualifica-
tion followed by an examination. Both elements are being rolled 
across Group companies. India, Mexico, Poland, Russia, the 
Czech Republic, the USA, Spain, Brazil and China already provide 
standardized qualification for managers.

Employees’ development into management roles is supported by 
the management selection process: in a comparative discussion 
with the relevant specialist departments, management candi-
dates are selected on the basis of their technical competencies, 
while their entrepreneurial skills are assessed in a Company-wide 
Management Assessment Center. In 2013, the Management 
 Assessment Center was launched successfully at  Volkswagen in 
Argentina, Spain, Mexico, the USA, China, Brazil and Slovakia 
and at the SEAT, MAN and Bentley brands. 
Professional academic Training
Under the auspices of the  Volkswagen Group Academy, the 
 AutoUni provides specialist academic knowledge and offers 
 employees a chance to learn from top experts within the 
 Volkswagen Group.
The qualification provision offered in conjunction with the spe-
cialist departments and partner universities is tailored to the 
needs of the Berufsfamilien. In-service qualification events 
 enable participants to learn from leading specialists within 
the Berufsfamilien, selected university professors, and experts 
from the private sector. This ensures that knowledge and experi-
ence are passed on within the Group and that new research 
 cascades down into Group companies. In 2013, there was a 
 particular emphasis on intelligent mobility, including electric 
traction, innovative drivetrains, lightweight design, and the 
sustainability of transport systems.
Over the past few years, the work of the AutoUni, which is based 
in Wolfsburg (Germany), has been extended around the world, 
with provision opening up in 2013 in Group locations in Bratis lava 
(Slovakia), Mlada Boleslav (Czech Republic), Martorell (Spain), 
and Shanghai and Beijing (China), among other locations. In 
2013, around 9,000 people took part in over 220  AutoUni courses. 
As part of our regional social outreach, around 20% of these 
events were open to the public. The AutoUni puts on more than 
650 speakers each year, with over 300 from the automotive sector 
alone. 
In the field of research, the AutoUni collaborates with leading 
international universities, institutes and research centers on a 
range of research projects and on academic dissertations and 
theses. It is also intensively involved in the   Volkswagen Group’s 
own doctoral student program, in which over 420 doctoral 
 students were supervised in 2013 by the various companies 
within the  Volkswagen Group in Germany. These doctoral 
 students undertake research into ambitious PhD thesis topics 
with relevance for the Company. To this end they work closely 
with their own department within the Group, which also 
 appoints a supervisor from within the Company. The latest 
 research findings then feed directly into AutoUni courses. 
 AutoUni supports doctoral students by providing seminars on 
academic writing, and its doctoral colloquium offers them the 
opportunity to present work-in-progress to a Group-wide audi-
ence and discuss their theses. 
 31
AutoUni also supports the  Volkswagen Group in identifying ap-
propriate academic partners from within research and teaching. 
It networks the persons responsible for university contacts within 
the Group to create synergies between brands and companies and 
to ensure that the processes involved in developing and imple-
menting university cooperation arrangements are consistent.
INTERNaTIONaL “SCIENCE aWaRD ELECTROCHEMISTRY”
Since 2012, we have joined forces with BASF to jointly sponsor out-
standing researchers and create new impetus for international ba-
sic research in the area of storage technologies, which are vital to 
electric mobility. The €50,000 prize money is intended as start-up 
funding for research activities. In 2013, the prize was won by the 
Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung in Düsseldorf (Germany) for 
a research project on electrocatalysts. 
PERFORMaNCE aND PaRTICIPaTION 
Fair pay and a share in the Company’s success underpin the moti-
vation and performance of our employees but also help to protect 
jobs and keep us competitive. Employee participation and codeter-
mination rights for employee representatives are key factors in the 
  Volkswagen Group’s success, so we engage in dialogue with our 
employees to set standards for good work.
Promoting Performance and Sharing Profits
The systematic fostering and recognition of good performance is 
another vital element in our PM strategy, along with redesigning 
our pay system to ensure that employees have a sustainable share 
in the success and profits of the Company.
Since 2010,  Volkswagen AG has had detailed standard criteria for 
skills development and performance assessment. These criteria  cover 
the entire workforce, from apprentices to top managers, and are un-
derpinned by concrete incentive systems within the pay structure. 
The pay system for  Volkswagen AG employees covered by collective 
agreement comprises three main components:
 > basic pay in the form of a competitive monthly salary
 > a performancerelated component, which rewards individual 
performance
 > an entitlement to profit-sharing, which is laid down by collective 
agreement.
This three-tier remuneration system has proven its worth within 
 Volkswagen AG as a tool enabling the workforce to participate in 
the Company’s success. At the same time, it helps recognize indi-
vidual achievements while maintaining competitiveness. 
The system is, therefore, increasingly being implemented as stan-
dard throughout the Group, including at Audi, ŠKODA and 
   Volkswagen Slovakia. In 2013, employees at more than 30 Group 
sites benefited from profit-sharing.

COLLECTIVE aGREEMENTS IN 2013
In 2013, the  Volkswagen Group conducted more than 20 rounds of 
collective bargaining in Germany and at sites around the world. 
There was a strike at one Group site that was, however, part of a 
sector-wide dispute between the relevant employers’ umbrella or-
ganization and the trade union and was resolved at that level. To 
preserve competitiveness and protect employment, a number of 
sites concluded collective agreements running for periods of more 
than one year.  Volkswagen AG’s 2013 settlement runs for 20 
months and provides for basic pay to rise by 3.4% from September 
1, 2013 and again, by 2.2%, from July 1, 2014.  Volkswagen AG also 
boosted pension provision for its employees by making a one-off 
employer contribution of €300 per employee to the Company pen-
sion plan. At  Volkswagen do Brasil plants, management and unions 
concluded local agreements in 2012 and 2013 that run for up to five 
years.  Volkswagen of South Africa (Pty.) Ltd. concluded a three-year 
collective agreement in July 2013, while ŠKODA Auto a. s. concluded 
a five-year agreement for permanent employees at its three loca-
tions in the Czech Republic, including a job security guarantee that 
is to date unique in the country.
Long Term Incentive (LTI) for Long-Term Success
The pay for management employees across the Group includes 
three variable components: the personal performance bonus; the 
Company bonus; and the Long Term Incentive (LTI), introduced in 
2010. The LTI is calculated over a four-year period, making it the 
component that reflects sustainable development by the Company. 
Components of this kind were required by the 2009 legislation on 
remuneration of Board of Management members, but the LTI is 
applied more widely at the  Volkswagen Group to the whole of its 
management. The Long Term Incentive is linked directly to the 
goals set out in the Group’s Strategy 2018: top employer status and 
top ratings for customer satisfaction, sales and profitability.
annual appraisal 
As part of the introduction of a performance-related pay compo-
nent, it was agreed that each employee should have an annual ap-
praisal with his or her line manager. This appraisal has two com-
ponents, performance assessment and development planning. 
Each employee is given specific feedback on his or her perfor-
mance and clear guidance on career prospects. Recognizing and 
valuing good performance is just as important in this context as 
identifying individual potential or specific further training needs. 
Appraisals using the same criteria were also carried out within 
 Volkswagen Financial Services AG and  Volkswagen Immobilien 
Service GmbH.
The system of appraisals linked in part to a performance-related 
pay component is being rolled out across Group brands and com-
panies. Over the reporting year, for example, appraisals in line 
with Group standards were introduced for all employees covered 
by collective bargaining at VW Group Rus in Kaluga (Russia). Indi-
vidual appraisal was also introduced for all management staff in 
2010. As well as performance assessment and development plan-
ning, these appraisals include target-setting and assessment of 
target achievement. 
Since 2013, all temporary external personnel employed at 
 Volkswagen AG also benefit from a performance-related pay 
 component from their second year with  Volkswagen. The process 
by which this component is determined is similar to the individual 
annual appraisal process at  Volkswagen AG.

Employment Security
We use a wide range of flexibility tools to help maintain competi-
tiveness and protect jobs. In 2013, we again responded flexibly to 
changes in the business environment. For example, we were able 
to protect jobs at  Volkswagen Autoeuropa by relocating around 
200 Portuguese production staff to  Volkswagen AG in Wolfsburg 
for several months, enhancing value at the German plant. 
Under the collective agreement on sustainable site retention 
and employment protection, all   Volkswagen AG employees en-
joy employment security until at least the end of 2014. The Inno-
vation Funds set up at the initiative of the General Works Council 
and  governed by the same collective agreement represent a 
 major contribution to safeguarding employment. There are two 
Funds: 
 > Innovation Fund I, set up in 2007, helps to further develop 
 existing skills areas at the various  Volkswagen sites.
 > Innovation Fund II, set up in 2011, develops new areas of 
business closely related to the automotive value production 
chain.
Until at least the end of 2014,  Volkswagen AG is committed to 
 recruiting apprentices and, subject to specific performance cri-
teria, giving them permanent employment on completion of their 
training. Former apprentices who do not meet these criteria are 
initially offered a two-year fixed-term contract. After two years, 
the performance assessment that forms part of their individual 
 annual appraisal constitutes the basis for the decision as to 
whether to take them on permanently.
RECRuITING LOCaL PERSONNEL
We support the recruitment and qualification of local personnel as 
a way of developing the local communities and regions in which the 
 Volkswagen Group operates. And when we open a new site, we 
 always seek to recruit local personnel. For example, when we 
opened the plant in Chattanooga (USA), we agreed to give local 
people priority in recruitment. The same is true of the new plant in 
Urumqi (China), where we plan to employ the groups that make up 
the region’s population on a pro rata basis (see page 38).
Participation and Co-Determination 
The International Charter on Labour Relations first came into 
force in 2009 and links increased participation rights with shared 
responsibility. The Charter applies internationally and provides 
for phased rights to information, consultation and codetermina-
tion for employee representatives of the brands, companies and 
sites represented on the Group Global Works Council. The rights it 
guarantees employee representatives relate, among other areas, 
to PM and industrial relations provisions, work organization, re-
muneration systems, information and communications, initial 
and in-service training, occupational health and safety, process 
controlling, and social and environmental sustainability. 
Since 2009, management and employee representatives at many 
sites outside Germany have negotiated declarations of intent and 
outline implementation arrangements. Further site agreements 
on local implementation of the Charter were concluded in 2013, 
including at Porsche Holding Gesellschaft m. b. H. in Salzburg 
and the  Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Ltd. 2013 also saw 
plant-level co-determination being extended at a number of sites 
in line with the Charter: the Indian plant at Pune, for example, was 
one of several to hold inaugural townhall meetings or symposia. At 
many sites, the work of local employee representatives is now 
 being coordinated or developed within special committees. 
Qualification workshops for local 
 implementation  of the Charter on 
 Labour Relations.
 
The Group Global Works Council and Company management 
regularly monitor implementation of the Charter on Labour Re-
lations in individual Group companies. At meetings of the Euro-
pean Group Works Council and the Group Global Works Council, 
representatives from the various sites report back on how local 
bodies and working structures are being set up and developed 
and how the tools contained in the Charter are being applied, 
sharing examples of best practice. In 2013, a number of quali-
fication workshops were held to help employee representatives 
implement the Charter locally: these workshops were held at 
cross-company level (for the Central and Eastern Europe region) 
as well as for specific sites, such as  Volkswagen in Pozna´n 
 (Poland), for production companies such as  Volkswagen India, 
and for the sales and financial services sector ( Volkswagen 
Group Sverige).
To improve the situation of workers, working conditions, parti-
cipation rights and job security in the Group’s Chinese joint 
 ventures, a Liaison and Coordinating Committee was set up back 
in 2008, bringing together the General Secretary of the Group 
Global Works Council, the Presidents of the trade unions within 
the Chinese joint venture companies, and representatives of the 
Company itself. Chinese joint venture companies that were not 
previously represented joined the Committee in 2013, most 
 notably the components plants. 
In September 2012, the Group Global Works Council set up a 
Commercial Vehicles Committee, bringing together employee 
representatives from the Scania, MAN and  Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles brands. This Committee supports the integra-
tion of commercial vehicle brands in the  Volkswagen Group and 
also has extensive information and co-determination rights. 
Since 2008, the Group Global Works Council has also had a Sales 
and Financial Services Committee. One of the roles of this Com-
67
mittee is to review and develop the co-determination rights of the 
companies represented on it in line with the International Charter 
on Labour Relations.
 CHaRTER ON TEMPORaRY WORk
The Charter on Temporary Work, signed in November 2012, rep-
resents agreement between Group management, the Group Euro-
pean Works Council and the Group Global Works Council on the 
key principles governing the use of temporary work across the 
Group. The underlying aim is to ensure that temporary external 
personnel benefit from appropriate employment and remunera-
tion conditions and that temporary work is managed consistently 
across the  Volkswagen Group. The main provisions of the Charter 
relate to:
 > The reasonable use of temporary work as a key flexibility tool
 > Implementation of equal pay: with reference to the standard 
basic salary
 > Implementation of equal treatment: temporary external person-
nel should enjoy parity of employment conditions and qualifica-
tion provision with the permanent workforce.
This Charter offers all temporary external personnel the chance 
to be moved on to a permanent contract provided they have the 
necessary skills and the Company has a need for those skills. 
However, temporary work is one way in which  Volkswagen can 
manage fluctuations in the economy or particular projects, such 
as constructing plants or sections of plants. In such cases, tem-
porary work, along with outside recruitment, may be a sensible 
PM strategy for supplementing the core workforce.
In 2013, measures were agreed at  Volkswagen Group locations to 
implement the Charter on Temporary Work, with the first packages 
of measures being put in place. Specific agreements implementing 
the provisions on equal pay and equal treatment were concluded at 
SITECH Sitztechnik GmbH and  Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH as 
well as at Bentley and ŠKODA.
The Employee Opinion Survey – Worldwide 
The employee opinion survey, or “Stimmungsbarometer”, is a tool 
that involves employees actively in what is going on in the Compa-
ny. This standardized Group-wide survey measures employee sat-
isfaction annually, and once the survey is complete, the findings 
are jointly discussed by supervisors and employees, a process that 
highlights problems on the one hand and suggestions for improve-
ments to work processes on the other. Improvements agreed on 
are then implemented before the following year’s survey. 
The employee opinion survey was conducted for the sixth time 
in 2013, and during the reporting year, a twelfth statement was 
added to the survey, seeking employees’ views on provision for 
in-service training. The survey covered 121 corporate sites and 
companies in 40 countries, and over 400,000 employees took part 
out of a possible total of around 450,000 – a response rate of 89%. 
The reporting year saw employees of Porsche, MAN,  Volkswagen 
Group Retail Deutschland GmbH and  Volkswagen Group Polska 
Sp. z. o. o take part for the first time.
Alongside the employee response rate, the key indicator generated 
by the employee opinion survey is the employee satisfaction index. 
During the reporting year, the score on this indicator was 79 out  
of 100.

Continuous Improvement and Ideas Management 
Employees use their creativity, knowledge and initiative to take 
responsibility for process and product improvement under the 
Ideas Management program. Ideas management is a vital man-
agement and motivational tool for line managers across the Com-
pany and has been an integral part of  Volkswagen’s culture of im-
provement for many years. The ideas management process also 
helps to make working at  Volkswagen both safer and healthier. 
The challenges of demographic change are given a high priority, 
with special consideration given to suggestions for ergonomic im-
provements. 
THE “ VOLkSWaGEN WaY”
The “ Volkswagen Way” is a key tool for securing continuous im-
provement. It has been an integral part of the way  Volkswagen op-
erates for six years. The core of the “ Volkswagen Way” is a process 
of continuous improvement which aims permanently to develop 
productivity and quality as well as ergonomics, leadership and 
teamwork. In the “ Volkswagen Way”, the Company has established 
a tool that consistently applies high standards to driving improve-
ment and solving problems systematically and sustainably across 
all areas. The commitment and involvement of every employee is 
essential to the success of this tool. In 2013, the focus was on 
 optimizing overarching workflows and improving teamwork. 
Company Benefits
The   Volkswagen Group offers all its employees the opportunity to 
acquire a vehicle from at least one Group brand on favorable 
terms. The terms of this benefit must be affordable for the employ-
ee and commercially viable for the Company. Apprentices at 
 Volkswagen AG, for example, enjoy special concessions on the 
 purchase or leasing of a vehicle.
 Volkswagen AG contributes to the benefits provided by social 
 insurance schemes, such as sick pay, and supports dependents 
when an employee dies. The Company also has a collective acci-
dent insurance policy that covers all employees against accidents 
resulting in death or invalidity. In exceptional cases of economic 
hardship, the Company grants employees a short-term loan. 
 Employees of Group companies around the world also enjoy 
 further company benefits. These may include:
 > subsidized transport and meals
 > low-cost accommodation 
 > monthly childcare allowances
 > discounts on selected leisure activities.
Health care benefits or additional pension insurance round off 
the range of company benefits.
THE COMPaNY PENSION PLaN
 Volkswagen AG, all its brands and all its subsidiaries in Germany run 
company pension plans to ensure that former employees have  
a source of income in retirement. At  Volkswagen AG, the arrange-
ments comprise a basic pension and contributory pensions I and II. 
The basic pension and contributory pension I are employer-funded, 
while contributory pension II offers employees an opportunity to 
convert part of their pretax salary into pension contributions. Since 
2001, payments to  Volkswagen AG’s Company pension plan have 
been invested in the capital markets by the scheme, which is ad-
ministered in trust by the  Volkswagen Pension Trust e. V. By the end 
of 2013, 22 other Group companies in Germany were also using 
these arrangements. 
At year-end 2013, the Company’s pension fund had total assets of 
€3,508 million for employees’ retirement and disability pensions 
and lifelong annuity benefits for surviving dependents in the event 
of death. Employees can also make direct contributions to their own 
pension provision by converting a proportion of their salary into 
pension contributions.
 Volkswagen AG’s Time Asset Bond is a scheme to reduce the length 
of an employee’s working life. Since 1998, the Bond has offered 
 employees the chance to bring forward their retirement age by 
making contributions from their gross salary or their working time 
credits. Their contributions are invested in the capital markets by 
the Time Asset Fund, which is administered in trust by the 
 Volkswagen  Pension Trust e. V. The Time Assets accumulated can 
then be used to enable employees to take paid time off in the 
 run-up to retirement. At the end of the reporting year, the Time 
 Asset Fund had  assets of €1,519 million.
The assets of the  Volkswagen Pension Trust are invested in special 
funds that comply with the provisions of Germany’s investment 
legislation. The two funds – one for the Company pension plan and 
the other for the Time Asset Bond – comprise individual segment 
funds for different investment classes. These segment funds are 
 administered by independent professional special fund managers. 
The  Volkswagen Pension Trust lays down investment guidelines  
for the special fund managers. These guidelines form part of the 
contract governing all special fund managers and specifically 
 exclude any  investment in companies manufacturing cluster 
 munitions. This  exclusion applies to all individual funds within  
the overall portfolio of around €5 billion. Within this portfolio, 
we have also set up two special sustainable investment funds, 
which apply sustainability criteria to investments in Europe and 
around the world.

HEaLTH aND FITNESS
Protecting and promoting good health is not just a social responsi-
bility and part of  Volkswagen’s corporate culture but also vital 
to the Company’s ongoing economic health and viability. The 
 Volkswagen Group’s integrated approach to health management 
goes well beyond traditional preventive health care and occupa-
tional safety and also includes a member of aspects such as work 
organization, ergonomics, leadership style and prospects for each 
individual. 
Workplace Ergonomics
The Group Production Ergonomics department, Health Services, 
the Works Council and the Occupational Health and Safety de-
partment are collaborating with Group brands to develop stan-
dards for an integrated approach to ergonomics. 
Ergonomic improvements across the entire product development 
process and throughout production ensure that workplace quality 
and the stress and strain on employees caused by production pro-
cesses are taken into account at the vehicle planning and design 
stages. The common objective is to combine ergonomically state-
of-the-art workplaces and innovative work processes using a mix 
of scientific findings and practical experience. The successful 
switch to the new  Volkswagen Golf model in 2012 provided an op-
portunity to make ongoing improvements in workplace ergonom-
ics. The deployment of occupational assistants on the production 
lines means that employees are able to receive advice and guid-
ance directly at their workplace about how to implement their 
workflows more ergonomically.
To reduce the impact on health of shift work,   Volkswagen AG plants 
have introduced new shift patterns. Ergoshift patterns involving 
short-cycle, forward-rotating shifts facilitate the body’s transition 
from one shift pattern to the next. Surveys among around 1,200 
employees across five  Volkswagen AG plants show that these er-
go-shift patterns impose less stress on employees’ fitness, health 
and well-being.
Now established at  Volkswagen locations, “Ergonomics and 
 De mo graphics Days” not only provide a forum for experts but also 
involve the entire workforce. As part of the Company’s Holistic Er-
gonomics Strategy, the 2013 “Ergonomics Day” at the  Volkswagen 
brand in Wolfsburg (Germany) presented measures for adapting 
both products and production processes to different age groups.
MAN has put all jobs at its production plants through a systematic 
ergonomic assessment as a way of managing demographic change, 
boosting employee performance and preventing physical impair-
ment.
Integrated Health Management
The Audi Checkup has been running since 2006, while   Volkswagen 
introduced its Checkup in 2010. The Checkup is a free, compre-
hensive preventive medical examination available to all employ-
ees. It helps maintain and improve the health, fitness and perfor-
mance of the workforce. Employees value the Checkup’s high 
diagnostic quality: nearly 61,000 staff have so far undergone 
 Volkswagen Checkups, while almost 60,000 Audi Checkups have 
been carried out. 
Following the successful introduction of the Checkup at sites in 
Germany, the Company has systematically broadened the range 
of both internal and external preventive health measures and 
training provision linked to the initiative. And the rollout of the 
  Volkswagen Checkup has continued across many Group sites 
abroad, while other Group companies have been bringing existing 
screening and preventive health programs into line with the 
Group-wide standards represented by the Checkup. In 2013 these 
included ŠKODA in the Czech Republic, where more than 15,000 
ŠKODA Checkups have since been carried out. MAN also offers 
 employees an annual MAN Checkup as part of a multilevel preven-
tive health program.
Extensive building work and new medical facilities at a range 
of Group sites helped to further optimize health provision for 
 employees in 2013: for example, health centers were built or

To ensure a common standard of health provision across the 
Group, a multi-level audit system was developed in 2010, compris-
ing self-audit and expert audit. Many sites have already success-
fully completed a self-audit, and some have conducted an expert 
 audit.
 
COMBaTING INFECTIOuS DISEaSES
 Volkswagen continued its international commitment to combating 
infectious diseases in 2013, for example through measures against 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. A particular focus was South Africa 
where, according to current statistics, HIV infection is becoming 
more prevalent among women aged between 25 and 35. In view of 
the continuing high rates of HIV infection,  Volkswagen has contin-
ued with an information, advice and testing program as part of its 
Checkup. In 2013, the rate of new infection was below 1%.
Occupational Safety 
As part of management development, supervisors in the Company 
are being made aware of the need to take greater account of the 
links between leadership and employees’ health in the way they do 
their job as managers. In addition, since early 2012,  Volkswagen 
in Germany has been organizing compulsory qualification mod-
ules on occupational safety for all future supervisors. On the basis 
of these qualification modules, the qualification building blocks 
for future Meister were standardized in 2013 and made a compul-
sory part of the group leader qualification. Since 2009, occupa-
tional safety officers at all German sites have been receiving occu-
pational safety qualification.

On the basis of the Group’s occupational safety management sys-
tem (KAMS), which was introduced in 2010, the companies in the 
 Volkswagen Passenger Cars Division and the   Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles Division have now carried out a comprehensive 
analysis of their existing occupational safety structures and pro-
cesses. The findings are now available across the Group via a 
 central database, and examples of good practice across the 
 Volkswagen Group are systematically disseminated. A health and 
safety committee has been set up at each included site to represent 
the entire local workforce. Moreover, all those involved have 
agreed to conduct a brand-specific audit at all  Volkswagen sites 
around the world from 2012. The Group’s occupational safety 
management system was successfully audited at Anchieta (Brazil), 
Puebla (Mexico), Pozna´n (Poland), and Osnabrück (Germany) 
during the reporting year.

2013 saw the 28th annual Occupational Safety Cup competition for 
 Volkswagen brand and  Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles plants in 
Europe: once again, the cup for safest plant went to the Bratislava 
site in Slovakia. The wide range of occupational safety measures 
continues to help reduce the frequency and consequences of acci-
dents. 
zERO-aCCIDENT INITIaTIVE aT MaN DIESEL & TuRBO
MAN Diesel & Turbo launched its zero-accident initiative in 2012 
with the aim of achieving further substantial reductions in the 
number and severity of work-related accidents. Alongside measures 
such as safety training courses and workshops to enable employees 
to share experiences, staff are also encouraged to be proactive. The 
aim is to create a culture in which each individual feels responsible 
for his or her own safety – and for the safety of colleagues. Below 
are just a few of the measures taken as part of the initiative at MAN 
plants:
 > accident analysis and lessons learned (Augsburg, Germany)
 > reduction in the number of injuries involving crushing (Ober-
hausen, Germany)
 > safety trail to raise awareness of risk (Zurich, Switzerland)
 > reporting and assessment of ‘near misses’ and hazardous situa-
tions (Copenhagen/Fredrikshavn, Denmark)
Company Medical Services and Emergency Situation 
 Management
Medical services and health care for  Volkswagen Group employ-
ees are in line with national legislation and internal regulations as 
well as with Group guidelines on protecting and promoting health. 
All Group locations have at least emergency health provision, 
while most locations offer medical services under the oversight of 
a doctor.
Rehabilitation Measures
A tailored rehabilitation program operates in many locations to 
reintegrate employees after serious and/or long-term illness, of-
fering early intervention and job-related support. The aim is to 
restore or stabilize the employees’ capacity and performance 
ability within three to six months. Depending on the particular 
needs in each case, the program also now includes preventive 
provision such as medical physical therapy, rehabilitation sport, 
functional training, and special back exercises.
Support and mentoring opportunities for employees with mental 
health or psychosomatic problems are also being expanded on 
an ongoing basis. Among other measures, employees with health 
problems have access to inhouse medical and psychological

 support, social coaching, a psychological counseling service and 
specific arrangements for psychosomatic consultations.
A preventive process for assessing the risk of psychological stress 
has been developed and is used to analyze jobs in a standardized 
and objective way. Specially trained analysts have used this to 
 analyze more than 900 jobs as part of a pilot project. The findings 
will now be evaluated, with plans under way to roll the process 
out more widely. 
Many performance-impaired employees have talents and exper-
tise that can be developed with targeted support; it is then often 
possible to move these employees to a job within the Company that 
is in line with their capacity. This recognition underpins the Work-
2Work program, which has been creating new job opportunities 
for performance-impaired employees at   Volkswagen AG since 
2001. Over recent years, some 1,800 employees have benefited 
from the program, and over 770 people are now employed in 
Wolfsburg in around 90 different fields of activity that have been 
adapted to their specific capacity.
auDI’S “WORk aND PSYCHOLOGICaL HEaLTH” PROGRaM
Over the last few years, AUDI AG has been developing and imple-
menting its “Work and Psychological Health” program on an on-
going cross-functional basis. Modules already in place within the 
company’s health provision include early recognition, advice and 
coaching for employees with mental health problems or who are at 
risk of addiction. Employees are also offered the opportunity for 
specialist mental health consultations. A further company-wide 
health initiative, “Audi in Balance”, is to be extended to improve 
communications around the issue of mental health. In collaboration 
with the Audi Academy, seminars aimed at specific target groups 
are being developed to enhance the mental wellbeing of managers 
and employees.
Provision for Older Employees
On the initiative of the German automotive industry’s represen-
tatives of people with severe disabilities,   Volkswagen AG, AUDI AG 
and Porsche AG took part in a research study entitled “Ageing 
Healthily and Appropriately in the Automotive Industry: Ca-
reer-Long Participation and Inclusion”, known by its German 
 acronym, PINA. This cooperation project, which is funded by 
 Germany’s Federal Ministry of Labour, also involves Darmstadt 
University of Technology and the University of Cologne. The 
partners are developing tools and initiatives to maintain the 
health and working capacity of older employees. The initiative 
aims not only to network operational processes and actors  but 
also to focus on the interfaces with bodies responsible for pre-
vention and rehabilitation, such as health, pension and acci-
dent insurance providers. 
 
Volkswagen supports employees making the transition from 
 employment to retirement. The Group’s internal “Senior Expert” 
program, for example, saw more than 400 retired  Volkswagen 
 employees passing on their experience in 2013, to mostly younger 
colleagues. These Senior Experts make a valuable contribution to 
knowledge transfer at  Volkswagen, enabling valuable expertise to 
remain within the Company. 
PROGRaM FOR OLDER WORkERS aT ŠkODa
ŠKODA’s “Seniority Programme” in the Czech Republic has for many 
years been taking preventive measures to promote the health  of 
older workers. Specially trained experts ensure that older produc-
tion workers benefit from a working environment that protects 
their health, while the company holds regular “health days” to raise 
awareness of the issues. ŠKODA has received both national and 
 international awards for this initiative.
More than 400 retired  Volkswagen employees passed their experience  
on to younger colleagues in 2013. These Senior Experts make a valuable 
contribution to knowledge transfer.

Recruiting and Developing Talented Women
The  Volkswagen Group is aiming to have 30% women at all levels 
of the management hierarchy in Germany in the long term. In 
line with this, the proportion of women in management within 
the  Volkswagen Group in Germany rose from 9.3% in 2012 to 
9.8% in 2013. The increased proportion of qualified women 
joining the Company will enable us steadily to lift the proportion 
of female  executives over the coming years. 
VOLuNTaRY uNDERTakING
The  Volkswagen Group considers both career and family life ex-
tremely important. In 1989,  Volkswagen AG became the first major 
German company to formulate guidelines on advancing women. As 
early as 2007,  Volkswagen AG set specific targets for increasing the 
proportion of women in the Company, and in spring 2011, the 
Group set differentiated targets within the framework of a volun-
tary undertaking to achieve sustainable growth in the proportion of 
women working for the Company in Germany. These include:
 > increasing the proportion of female apprentices 
 > increasing the proportion of female Meister and skilled workers
 > increasing the proportion of female graduate and professional 
 recruits
 > increasing the proportion of female executives. 
Our aim: 30% women at all levels of the 
management hierarchy.
 
 Volkswagen recruits the best graduates in their cohort in the skills 
areas it needs and develops them systematically. As a starting 
“Woman Experience Days”: young female engineers get to know 
 Volkswagen at first hand and try out the Touareg.
point, we take the proportion of female graduates in each disci-
pline, so that, for example, around 10% of all the mechanical en-
gineers we recruit should be women. For electrical engineers, the 
proportion is also 10%, rising to 50% in business areas. When all 
the disciplines relevant to  Volkswagen’s work are averaged out, 
these differentiated quotas produce a recruitment target of at least 
30% female graduates. In 2013, around 30% of graduate recruits 
at  Volkswagen AG were female. 
Women accounted for 27.4% of all apprentices in 2013 and for 
21.4% of apprentices in industrial or technical professions. This 
means that the   Volkswagen Group in Germany has one of the high-
est proportions of female apprentices of any automotive company 
in the country.   Volkswagen is keen to increase the proportion to 
nearly 30%, however, and is actively seeking to recruit talented 
women. The tools it is using include special information days on 
industrial or technical vocational education and training at 
 Volkswagen and hands-on experience days for young women. For 
a number of years, the  Volkswagen, Audi, MAN and Porsche 
brands have taken part in a national initiative, “Girls’ Day”, and 
in 2013, they offered 2,370 female school students in Germany 
a practical insight into the careers offered by the automotive 
 industry.
In 2012,  Volkswagen began collaborating with universities to 
 offer female students with the Abitur – Germany’s school-leaving 
examination – a six-month internship. Known as the “Lower Sax-
ony Technikum”, this internship is designed to make technology 
more attractive to young women and encourage them to take up 
courses in such areas as mechanical engineering, electrical 
 engineering, vehicle technology, and mechatronics. 22 of the 24 
young women who took part in 2012 went on to study for a degree  
in a technical area in 2013. In 2013, 25 young women completed 
 the “Lower Saxony Technikum”.
 Volkswagen forges links with female students early in their 
 academic careers. Its “Woman Experience Day”, launched in 
2012, is aimed at female students and graduates in engineering 
subjects. Participants spend a day and a half with   Volkswagen and 
Girls’ Day 2013 at the Wolfsburg plant – girls are showing unprecedented 
interest in Germany’s most attractive employer.

are able to talk to experienced female engineers and PM experts. 
The Company has so far run seven “Woman Experience Days”, 
 offering more than 120 young women an insight into the wide 
 variety of career opportunities the Company can offer them. 
27.4% of all apprentices across the Group 
 in 2013 were women.
 
Since 2004, the Company has been running the “Woman 
 DrivING Award”, a competition aimed at top female engineers. 
The competition is held across Germany every two years and is 
designed to encourage young female graduates into employment 
in technical areas, where they can contribute to designing and 
producing the cars of tomorrow.

 Volkswagen AG also offers a mentoring program. Having been 
through 21 cycles with almost 400 female participants, it is a 
 recognized development program within the Group for bringing 
on female specialists and managers. 40 women took part in the 
 Volkswagen AG mentoring program in 2013 and received support 
in their move into management. 
 Volkswagen is also aiming to increase the proportion of skilled 
 female workers and female Meister to 10%. In 2013, 30 women 
within  Volkswagen AG benefited from a tailored mentoring 
 program designed to help them progress to Meister grade. 
Audi, too, is aiming to recruit talented women, for example 
through careers guidance events targeting female school students 
and the “CareerDay Women” initiative for young women studying 
technical subjects. To boost the proportion of women in manage-
ment positions, the “Sie und Audi” (Women and Audi – You and 
Audi) initiative offers a range of programs aimed specifically at 
advancing women to leadership or junior management roles. 
Since 2001, Porsche has been using the “Femtec.Network” 
 platform as a targeted tool for recruiting highly skilled female 
 engineers. The platform is a collaboration between eleven tech-
nology companies, with nine technical universities joining the 
scheme in January 2014. The aim is to foster women studying engi-
neering and science subjects.
Combining Work and Family 
As well as recruiting and advancing talented women,  Volkswagen 
is working continually to improve employees’ ability to combine 
work and family responsibilities. These include:
 > substantial flexibility in relation to hours of work
 > an extensive range of part-time and shiftworking arrangements
 > a return to work at the same level after parental leave
 > childcare either within or near the company premises.
Measures such as teleworking and new information and commu-
nications technologies are also helping employees to find the 
solution to combining work and family responsibilities that suits 
them best.
To maintain contact with employees on parental leave and to 
 ensure a smooth return to work at the same level,  Volkswagen of-
fers work options during parental leave, get-togethers for employ-
ees on parental leave, and seminars. Since 1995, the Company has 
been running “Family Management and Career” seminars at the 
Wolfsburg plant, while   Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles offers 
similar provision. All employees on parental leave are invited in 
to the Company six months before they are due to return to work to 
discuss how they want to manage their working life and future 
 career and obtain information and advice on the range of child-
care provision available. At the same time, they are also briefed on 
the statutory provisions and Company arrangements for parental 
leave and returning to work. 
A further step on the way to becoming a family-friendly employer 
is the ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provision. From 
2013, childcare during school holidays is now available at all 
 Volkswagen AG sites following the introduction of such provision 
at   Volkswagen Financial Services AG and AUDI AG, which have 
been running schemes since 2008 and 2011 respectively.

 Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH and   Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH 
also rolled out holiday childcare provision in 2013.
The   Volkswagen Group has found it beneficial to establish child-
care facilities within or near the Company. For example, MAN 
 offers company childcare facilities at its Munich and Augsburg 
 locations.  Volkswagen Financial Services AG’s “Frech Daxe” nurs-
ery in Braunschweig is one of Germany’s largest company nurs-
eries, while  Volkswagen Group of America has been offering 
childcare provision at its Chattanooga (USA) plant since 2012.
 Volkswagen AG has a wide range of provision for time off to help its 
employees care for close family members. Employees have a right 
to take up to ten working days’ leave at short notice to organize 
 appropriate care or to make other arrangements. They may also 
take up to six months’ part-time or full-time leave to fulfill their 
caring responsibilities. 
 Volkswagen is particularly flexible in its commitment to reemploy-
ing workers who take extended leave. For the past 20 years or  
so, employees have been able to request up to eight years’ leave of 
absence without having to give reasons and have a guaranteed 
right to re-employment on their former terms and conditions. 
Inclusion
People with disabilities made up 7.18% of the total workforce of 
 Volkswagen AG in 2013 – once again, well above the statutory 
 quota. 55% of all employees with disabilities worked in produc-
tion and 45% in the non-production sector. The Company is par-
ticularly committed to helping employees with disabilities. When 
new buildings are constructed or existing ones are refurbished, 
emphasis is placed on creating accessible workstations, staff can-
teens, and toilets and washrooms. A Company-wide working 
group on inclusion is also focusing on establishing a corporate 
culture of inclusion; the Company and the Works Council are 
working together on ways to boost inclusion. This includes qualifi-
cation and awareness-raising for managers and PM experts and 
ensuring that the application process is accessible to candidates 
with disabilities. 
  Volkswagen is also helping to boost employment for people with 
severe disabilities outside the Company: during the reporting 
year, it placed orders worth more than €22.5 million with work-
shops employing people with disabilities. 
The Company is also particularly committed to its perfor-
mance-impaired employees outside Germany. An example here is 
the six sheltered workshops that employ more than 200 people 
with disabilities at the ŠKODA production plants in the Czech Re-
public. Working closely with KOVO, the local trade union, ŠKODA 
continues to use these facilities to create new employment pros-
pects for employees whose health is impaired. The “New Horizon“ 
program being run by MAN Latin America since 2011 offers young 
people with disabilities a chance to work within the Company, 
benefit from further training measures and qualify for a grant for 
degree-level study on the same terms as able-bodied employees. In 
the 2013 financial year, 22 young women and men took part in 
“New Horizon”.
INCLuSION aWaRD 2013
During the reporting year,  Volkswagen AG was awarded the 
 “Inklu sionspreis 2013 – Unternehmen fördern Inklusion” (Compa-
nies Promoting Inclusion) prize. The award recognizes  Volkswagen’s 
achievements in the area of inclusion and is sponsored by the Un-
ternehmensForum, an association devoted to ensuring that people 
with disabilities are able to play a full part in employment. In 2013, 
the prize was jointly sponsored by the German government’s 
 Anti-Discrimination Agency and the German employers’ association 
(BDA). It recognizes exemplary commitment to cooperation be-
tween people with and without disabilities. 
Mobility aids boost independence: with manual controls, relocated 
accelerators, indicators and wiper controls, and steering wheels 
with rotary knobs,  Volkswagen has for many years been helping to 
give people with disabilities some of their independence back.
International Diversity
The  Volkswagen Group is a complex global undertaking with 106 
manufacturing plants across Europe, North America, Asia and 
 Africa.   Volkswagen vehicles are sold in 153 countries and in 2013, 
 Volkswagen AG alone employed nationals of 104 countries. The 
Company is deeply committed to promoting peaceful cooperation 
between diverse traditions and cultures.
Equal Opportunities
 Volkswagen is committed to respect, tolerance and cosmopoli-
tanism. Treating each other with respect and working together 
means valuing each individual’s personality.  Volkswagen guar-
antees equal opportunity and equal treatment irrespective of 
ethnicity, skin color, gender, disability, ideology, faith, national-
ity, sexual orientation, social background or political conviction, 
provided this is based on democratic principles and tolerance 
towards those who hold different views. The  Volkswagen Group’s 
Code of Conduct underpins this aspiration across the Group, and 
every employee and member of an executive body has responsi-
bility under the Code for ensuring that individuals work together 
in partnership. 
75
The fact is, however, that discrimination happens in all parts of 
society. Openness and transparency, collegiality, and civil cour-
age have proved the best tools with which to combat it, so every 
employee is under an obligation to notify any breach of the Code 
without delay. If an employee feels he or she is being discriminat-
ed against, the Company meets the statutory provisions for 
 whistle-blowing but also provides access to trained personnel to 
support and advise the individual concerned. At the employee’s 
request, meetings can be organized with all parties to resolve 
the situation, and this system has proved successful in resolving 
many disputes before they ever reached the formal complaint 
stage. If there is a major breach of the Code of Conduct, the 
 Company may take appropriate action against an individual who 
is acting in a discriminatory way; sanctions range from a formal 
warning or relocation to dismissal. 
At the initiative of the Works Council, these rights and obligations 
were laid down in 1996 in the “Cooperative Conduct at the Work-
place” works agreement for all   Volkswagen AG employees and 
sites. The agreement was revised in 2007, and every new employee 
receives a copy or a briefing when they are appointed.
RESPECT aND EQuaL OPPORTuNITIES aT PORSCHE
Porsche sees itself as a multicultural company, employing around 
60 different nationalities at its two plants in Germany. Since 2011, 
the Executive Board and the General Works Council have been in-
volved in a nationwide initiative, “Respekt! – Kein Platz für Rassis-
mus” (Respect! No Room for Racism). The initiative originates in 
sport and is intended to combat racism and discrimination in soci-
ety and in companies. The company supports it with regular activi-
ties, including a film shown on the staff TV channel and display of 
“Respect” posters at the plant gates.
SOCIaL RESPONSIBILITY
For the  Volkswagen Group, corporate social responsibility means 
commitment to local well-being beyond the factory gates. Our pri-
orities include support for future-oriented, education and social 
projects, primarily in the locations where the Group operates. But 
we also offer rapid support to the victims of natural disasters and 
we promote volunteering by our employees.
Commitment to the Regions
We are committed to the regions in which our sites are based:  
a sustainable environment that is pleasant to live in gives a region 
the edge in competition for business, boosts local employees’ 
 quality of life, and makes us more attractive as an employer. This is 
why, for example,  Volkswagen AG supports regional growth ini-
tiatives in areas including education, health, leisure, energy and 
transport alongside a broad range of measures to promote busi-
ness. 
Wolfsburg AG, based within the Group headquarters in Wolfsburg 
(Germany), provides a fine example here. This public-private 
 partnership with the City of Wolfsburg, launched in 1999, is in-
volved in future-oriented projects focusing on the important  
topics of employment and quality of life. And this joint undertaking 
is proving very successful: in November 2013, Wolfsburg topped 
the table for economic growth in a survey of German towns and 
 cities by the business magazine Wirtschaftswoche and scored very 
highly for tax revenue, productivity and women’s employment. 
And the entire region now benefits from the work done to develop 
structures and local amenities. Wolfsburg AG works closely with 
the “Allianz für die Region GmbH”, or Regional Alliance, which 
takes in the towns of Wolfsburg, Braunschweig and Salzgitter and 
the surrounding rural areas as well as regional businesses.

Commitment to Education
We also use our expertise in mobility and road safety in school 
education projects. Just one of many examples from companies 
within the Group is the “Parque Polo”, an area providing road 
safety training through play for children and sited in the grounds 
of the  Volkswagen Navarra plant (Pamplona, Spain). The park 
was opened in 1999 and is aimed at children aged five to 15. It is 
a community project run by  Volkswagen Navarra and the Navarra 
savings bank foundation and supported by the regional govern-
ment and a number of local businesses. In 2013, the park attract-
ed 7,100 schoolchildren, taking the total numbers visiting the 
park since it was opened to 105,050. 
In addition to regional infrastructure projects,  Volkswagen is 
also actively involved in education in the region. The “Neue 
Schule Wolfsburg” project, an initiative to set up a new school in 
Wolfsburg in partnership with the city and local businesses, 
opened its doors in August 2009. This primary and secondary 
school, which is open to all children from the City of Wolfsburg 
and the surrounding region, designs its curriculum around five 
key themes: a strong international focus, science and technolo-
gy, business, the arts, and the promotion of talent. In the current 
(2013/2014) school year, the school has some 600 students in 
years 1 to 4 and 5 to 9 (those aged between six and nine and 
 between ten and 14). 
 36
As well as school-based educational projects, many Group loca-
tions have also launched road safety initiatives. Porsche AG, for 
 example, runs its “Kids Driving School” across Germany. This 
unique initiative, developed with Ferrero and its “Kinder  Surprise” 
range, enables children to learn road safety through play. 
ŠKODA, too, is constantly expanding its road safety training 
 activities. The multimedia tool “Playful ŠKODA” is aimed 
 primarily at school-age children and helps young children to 
get to grips with the concepts and rules of road traffic. This 
 interactive tool can be accessed in four languages via the  ŠKODA 
website (see page 40).
Volunteering
 Volkswagen takes enormous pride in its commitment to volunteer-
ing. The “  Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt” ( Volkswagen Supports Vol-
unteering) initiative is aimed both at current employees and their 
partners and at retirees. It operates as a clearing house, linking 
community initiatives looking for volunteers with   Volkswagen 
staff wanting to help their society. The aim is to boost the profile of 
volunteering in the public perception and to support and promote 
volunteering. However, we also gain from having employees who 
devote their free time to their local community and thereby en-
hance their social skills. “ Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt” is thriving: 
during summer 2013, for example, more than 700  Volkswagen 
employees volunteered to help the victims of flooding in Germany. 
Employee volunteers enjoy the support and appreciation of their 
line managers, too. In 2013 alone, line managers held more than 
950 debriefings with volunteers, and by the end of the reporting 
year, the initiative had placed around 1,700 volunteers. Similar 
programs have now been introduced in other Group companies, 
including Audi, MAN and ŠKODA.
The   Volkswagen Group also supports volunteering by its employ-
ees at locations around the world. For example, Porsche supports 
the work done by the charity “Un Techo Para Mi País” (A Roof  
for My Country) in more than a dozen countries in Latin America, 
including Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Since 1997, this charity – 
which now works across 19 Latin American and Caribbean coun-
ties – has been helping to provide permanent housing for socially 
disadvantaged and isolated people and to integrate them into 
 stable communities. Financial support from Porsche has helped to 
build more than 250 homes over the past two years, and more than 
2,000 volunteers have been involved, including the Porsche Latin 
America team but also staff from local Porsche importers.
around 1,700  Volkswagen volunteers 
have been placed since 2008.
 
Company Donations
The  Volkswagen Group’s commitment to donations and sponsor-
ship is a key part of our corporate identity and reflects our desire to 
fulfill our corporate social responsibility. We support a wide range 
of organizations and events around the world. The principles 
 underpinning donations and sponsorship are governed by our 
Group-wide Code of Conduct, which stipulates that we give 
 donations in cash and in kind for activities and projects primarily 
devoted to research and education, culture and sport, and social 
causes. 
 Volkswagen AG is committed to research, education, charitable 
purposes, sport, culture, general welfare and other causes, and 
churches, religious bodies and learned bodies.  Volkswagen grants 
donations only to organizations recognized to be non-profit or 
that are authorized by special provisions to accept donations. 
  Volkswagen does not donate to political parties, party-affiliated 
foundations or representatives of the political arena. Over the 
 reporting year,  Volkswagen AG donated a total of €19 million. 2013 
donations supported social bodies but also gave particular help to 
the victims of major natural disasters: the relevant Group brands 
and companies provided support for those affected by flooding 
across Europe (see overview).

Employee Donations
In 2013, employees of   Volkswagen AG alone gave more than €3.5 
million to good causes. Workforce donations represent a major 
contribution by  Volkswagen AG companies and their employees 
to those in need in locations where the Company operates, includ-
ing the “Starthilfe” (Getting Started) project devoted to combat-
ing the growing problem of child poverty in the Wolfsburg region. 
In the “One Hour for the Future” campaign,  Volkswagen and 
Audi employees donate an hour’s pay to help street children. 
Since the summer of 2003, this initiative has also included the 
collection of “spare cents”: employees donate the odd cents in-
cluded in their monthly pay slip. 
Employees at   Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and MAN also donated 
around €1.7 million to victims of flooding in Germany; the money 
helped support a number of reconstruction projects in the four 
federal states affected. 
THE  VOLkSWaGEN EMPLOYEES’ FOuNDaTION
The  Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation was set up in 2011 as  a 
charitable foundation by  Volkswagen AG with the aim of promot-
ing initial, continuing and vocational training, education, and sup-
port for young people, with a particular focus on improving the 
living conditions of children and adolescents regardless of their 
 origin, background or beliefs. To achieve this effectively, the 
 Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation restricts its activities to areas 
surrounding the Group’s locations worldwide. It focuses primarily 
on vocational training for socially disadvantaged young people. 
For the purposes of implementation, the Foundation partners with 
the children’s charity “terre des hommes”; this charity oversees 
projects supported by the Foundation, particularly those outside 
Germany, works alongside local cooperation partners, and moni-
tors the progress of projects. Since 2011, the  Volkswagen Employ-
ees’ Foundation has launched or supported six projects in Germa-
ny and elsewhere in line with its aims.

Fairtrade
At the suggestion of the General Works Council,  Volkswagen AG 
has been selling Fairtrade-branded products in its catering facil-
ities via its catering provider, Service Factory Gastronomie und 
Hotellerie, since 1999. Fairly traded products help producers in 
developing countries to earn an independent and dignified 
livelihood, and support for Fairtrade has been growing across 
the Group: in 2013, for example, total consumption of Fairtrade 
 coffee rose 4.3% to 48.5 t. And since 2012,  Volkswagen has also 
been selling Fairtrade craft items: producers in Madagascar use 
recycled cans to produce model vehicles based on the iconic VW 
Beetle and VW Transporter T2.

OuR COMMITMENT REFLECTS THE GROuP’S  
BaSIC PRINCIPLES
The  Volkswagen Group supports a wide range of projects prom-
oting the arts and culture, education, science, health and 
sport, regional structural development and environmental 
protection. The following fundamental principles underpin 
our choice of CSR projects:
 > The projects are in line with the Group’s Basic Principles and 
address a specific local or regional issue.
 > They reflect diversity within the Group and in the social envi-
ronment in which the projects are sited.
 > They involve a close stakeholder dialogue with actors on the 
ground, who are involved in carrying out the projects.
 > Project management is based locally and overseen by local 
units.
The long-standing and wide-ranging cooperation arrangements 
we have with Germany’s Nature and Biodiversity Conservation 
Union (NABU – see page 109) and the German Red Cross (DRK) 
are prime examples of our activities as a good corporate citizen. 
Companies within the Group have similar cooperation arrange-
ments: MAN, for example, works with the SOS Children’s Villages 
charity. These projects, and those outlined below, illustrate our 
philosophy of CSR based on continuity and sustainability. 
As one of the world’s largest automotive companies with plants on 
virtually every continent, we want to create added value in the 
 regions in which we operate. Our aim is that employees, share-
holders, the local population and customers should all benefit 
from what we do. Please see our 2012 brochure “Responsibility 
knows no boundaries” for further information on the host of 
 projects we support to achieve this aim.

FOuNDaTIONS WITHIN THE  VOLkSWaGEN GROuP
In most cases, the projects adopted by foundations within the 
 Volkswagen Group are funded out of returns on share capital and 
by workforce and Company donations. The foundations support 
and foster employee engagement for the welfare of the respective 
region, process and decide on project applications, and ensure that 
the funds are deployed where they are needed. 
 > Audi Stiftung für Umwelt (Germany): the aim of this environmen-
tal foundation, which was set up in 2009, is to support charitable 
causes and, in particular, conservation and environmental pro-
tection and research. 
 > Fundação  Volkswagen (Brazil): this foundation has been support-
ing education and social development for 33 years, and 1 million 
schoolchildren have already benefited from its projects.
 > The  Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation (Germany): set up in 
2011, this foundation focuses on socially disadvantaged children 
and adolescents living near  Volkswagen Group plants around the 
world. It supports initial, continuing and vocational training, edu-
cation, and youth work, with a special focus on improving the 
lives of children and adolescents (see page 77). 
 >  Volkswagen Community Trust (South Africa): founded in 1988, 
the Trust aims to help people in the region to help themselves. 
The Trust is active in the fields of education and employment, 
health care and sport and involves  Volkswagen employees 
through volunteering programs (see page 118). 
 >  Volkswagen Slovakia (Slovakia): this foundation, created in 2008, 
has the aim of promoting education and training in Slovakia.

The Academy can train up to 500 apprentices at one time and focus­
es particularly on offering initial and continuing training opportu­
nities to young people from the region. Recruiting female talent is 
particularly important to Scania. The original target was to have 
30% female apprentices, but at 43%, the current figure is higher.

­Renewed
In 2013, the  Volkswagen Group of America, the Museum of 
 Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and the affiliated MoMA PS1 
renewed their 2011 partnership for a further two years. A high­
light of the partnership in 2013 was the “EXPO 1: New York” 
 exhibition, which ran from May to September and highlighted 
environmental challenges against the backdrop of a tough eco­
 nomic and social climate. 
­Volkswagen­Financial­Services:­“My­Finance­Coach”­
 Volkswagen Financial Services AG’s nationwide program in Germa­
ny, “My Finance Coach”, has two aims. It works to give children and 
adolescents a good general education about money and finance but 
also tackles a social issue that has become more acute over recent 
years. The company sees itself as an integral part of society and is 
keen to boost social development, so staff from  Volkswagen Finan­
cial Services have got involved in what they know best: passing on 
knowledge about the economic context and how to handle money 
and financial affairs.

Located at the  Volkswagen plant in Pune, India, which opened in 
2009, the  Volkswagen India Academy fulfills a number of training 
roles and contributes to the future viability of the region. The 
Academy’s main role is to train young people to Group standards. 
It offers continuing professional development for employees at the 
Pune plant and at  Volkswagen’s other Indian plant in Auranga­
bad. It also provides in­service training for external service staff 
and dealers in all the Group brands represented in India.

Autostadt­GmbH:­Learning­sustainability
The “Mobility Curriculum in the Autostadt in Wolfsburg” initiative 
has been officially incorporated in the United Nations Decade of 
Education for Sustainable Development, qualifying as part of the 
national action plan. The Official Measures of the UN Decade play 
a central role in the German UNESCO commission’s efforts to 
meet the strategic goals in the national action plan. “In contrast to 
the many UN Decade projects with a primarily local focus that have 
been recognized as best practice examples, the Official Measures 
make a structural contribution toward anchoring sustainable­
development education in the system.”
Bentley:­Voluntary­Support­for­Hospice
For many years, employees at Bentley in Crewe (United Kingdom) 
have been supporting St. Luke’s Hospice. Most recently, they 
helped renovate a classic Routemaster London bus, fitting it out 
with a Bentley interior. The bus, which they have named Luke, 
houses a charity shop and is a very successful way of raising dona­
tions for the work of the hospice. 59 Bentley employees have devot­
ed a total of 2,000 hours of their free time to the project. 
MAN­Latin­America:­New­Horizons­for­People­with­
­Disabilities
Official statistics show that people with disabilities in Brazil face 
greater difficulty in accessing education and training. To help reme­
dy the situation, MAN Latin America has set up the “New Horizon” 
program in cooperation with universities in Resende, Barra Mansa 
and Volta Redonda. Each year, the program provides grants for 
 students with a disability; MAN benefits by gaining access to new 
 talent. MAN also supports “Ambassadors of Joy”, Brazil’s first samba 
school for people with disabilities. 
­Volkswagen­Group:­School­Forests­against­Climate­Change
Since 2011 the  Volkswagen Group has been supporting the “School 
Forests against Climate Change” project run by the Future Forest 
Foundation, an initiative of the Lower Saxony Forestry Office. By 
participating in reforestation efforts, schoolchildren are making an 
active contribution to reducing greenhouse gases, working together 
to promote biodiversity, and becoming more aware of nature conser­
vation issues. In the year under review the project was honored by the 
German National Committee of the UN Decade of Education for 
 Sustainable Development. Students had a chance to demonstrate 
their creativity in a competition for the best song lyrics about the 
School Forests project. The winning song was recorded by musician 
and music producer Leslie Mandoki.

Focus on renewables
Wind and Water
Renewable energies are a pivotal element in the  Volkswagen Group’s Strategy 
2018. Making the best possible use of renewables requires dedicated concepts 
for each market. Brazil, for example, offers favorable conditions for the use  
of hydropower.  Volkswagen do Brasil already meets almost one fifth of its 
electricity requirements from renewables with the Anhanguera power plant, 
and is also committed to ensuring reliable access to drinking water.
In South America, the  Volkswagen Group is represented by a total of nine sites in Brazil and Argentina. The  Volkswagen brand 
 is  a major producer alongside Scania and MAN. By way of example, the São Carlos (Brazil) plant, with a workforce of around 
730 employees, produces engines for 48 different models.  Volkswagen do Brasil has four production sites in the country.

Focus on Brazil
Water is life. But in Brazil, with its numerous rivers and high 
gradients, water is also a key source of energy. Around 80% of 
the energy produced in Brazil comes from hydropower. The 
 Volkswagen Group is a significant contributor. The Anhangu-
era small hydropower plant, built in collaboration with two 
 local partners, went on stream in 2010, and feeds around 100 
gigawatt-hours of electricity into the national grid each year. 
This covers a good 18% of the energy used by the four Brazilian 
 Volkswagen plants. The province of São Joaquim da Barra also 
draws lasting financial benefits from the hydropower plant, 
which brings a 25% increase in its annual tax revenues. 
“our long-term aim is to meet up 
to 80% of our energy requirements  
from our own sources.”
Eduardo Barros, Head of Legal Affairs and Board Member of 
 Volkswagen do Brasil responsible for sustainability
For  Volkswagen do Brasil, Anhanguera is just the start of an 
 ambitious initiative to generate the company’s own green elec-
tricity. “Our long-term aim is to meet up to 80% of our energy 
requirements from our own regenerative sources and protect 
ourselves against future price increases,” explains Eduardo 
Barros, Head of Legal Affairs and Board Member of  Volkswagen 
do Brasil responsible for sustainability. Another form of energy 
that is due to take on a more significant role in the energy mix is 
wind energy, which has today become the most economical 
source of energy in Brazil. The potential here is enormous, with 
recent studies quoting a theoretical total potential of 143 giga-
watts.
The company’s sustainable energy strategy is already paying 
dividends: in 2012  Volkswagen do Brasil became the first auto-
mobile manufacturer in Brazil to be given the go-ahead to issue 
CO2 certificates by the Secretariat of the United Nations Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Over a ten-year period, the 
 Volkswagen Group is entitled to sell certificates for a total of 
around 162 tonnes of CO2 on the open market.
Generating energy in an eco-friendly fashion is part of the global 
 Volkswagen “Think Blue. Factory.” strategy (see pages 14, 104). 
The solar park at the  Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga (USA), 
which went on stream in early 2013, is a good example. It gener-
ates up to 13,100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity each 
year, which is used directly in production, covering 12.5% of   
the plant’s energy demand at full capacity. The SEAT plant in 
 Martorell (Spain), meanwhile, boasts the largest rooftop solar 
plant of any automaker, with an annual output capacity of 15,000 
MWh of electricity. By 2018 the  Volkswagen Group plans to in-
vest around €600 million in photovoltaics, combined heat and 
power plants, biomass plants and wind farms at its sites around 
the world.
Implementation of these projects is subject to stringent en-
vironmental conditions. Take Brazil, for example: hydropower 
plants often require large reservoirs, which can mean severe 
intrusion on nature. As part of its commitment to minimize en-
vironmental impacts,  Volkswagen do Brasil prefers to focus on 
small plants, which only require a small reservoir and do not 
significantly alter the natural water flow. At the Anhanguera 
small hydro, the impounded water remains in the reservoir for 
just 24 hours before passing through the three turbines and 
 resuming its course down the Sapucaí River. This eliminates 
the risk of methane formation associated with lengthy stagnation. 
 Volkswagen do Brasil operates a comprehensive reforestation 
program to keep the surrounding ecosystem intact. 116 hect-
ares of varied, species-rich forest has been planted around the 
reservoir, in place of the former sugar cane monoculture. Up-
stream of the dam, there is now a 5.8 kilometer greenbelt with 
more than 100 species of plants and trees. In addition, in close 
cooperation with experts including scientists from the Univer-
sity of São Paulo, a monitoring and protection program for in-
digenous fauna has been created that also covers the various 
life forms in the rivers. On the Sapucai River, a fish ladder has 
been installed to enable the fish to progress unhindered. The 
company’s efforts have caused quite a stir in the expert community. 
At the “Hydro Vision Brasil 2013” conference for hydropower in 
Latin America, Anhanguera was awarded first prize in the “Eco-
logical Sustainability” category. 
€600 million will be invested by  
the  Volkswagen Group in renewable 
electricity generation at its sites 
around the world by 2018.
 Volkswagen do brasil’s involvement with water goes be-
yond its own production operations; the company also builds 
easy-to-install, maintenance-friendly water pumps that supply 
free water to nine Brazilian states. Although Brazil has a   
very high annual rainfall, this is unevenly distributed over the 
country.  Volkswagen do Brasil has so far installed more than 
1,000 manually operated pumps as part of the Popular Water 
Pump initiative, giving 140,000 people access to drinking 
 water, especially during periods of drought. During his visit to 
Brazil in May 2013, German President Joachim Gauck praised 
this commitment, and even had a go at turning the wheel of a 
“bomba d’água popular” himself.

The Environmental Strategy signed off by the Group Board of 
 Ma nagement provides a framework for taking the Company to the 
top  of the environmental league and is based around four target 
areas: “Top in intelligent mobility”, “Leaders in eco-friendly prod-
ucts”, “Top in lifecycle-based resource conservation” and “Consis-
tent  anchoring throughout the Company”. Intelligent mobility 
unites our philosophy of mobility and comfort, environmental 
 protection and low costs with the avoidance of wastefulness in 
transport. Ef ficient interplay between people, infrastructure, 
techno logy and transport is pivotal to our approach. Driven by our 
quest for environmental leadership by 2018, we are committed to 
 making our production up to 25% more eco-friendly per vehicle 
manufactured than in 2010. In concrete terms, 25% reductions 
are to be achieved in energy and water consumption, as well as in 
CO2/km and solvent emissions and waste for disposal. 
25% less energy, water, waste, 
solvents and co2 by 2018.
 
For our German sites, which currently account for around 45%  
of our Group-wide CO2 emissions from production, we have set 
ourselves an even more ambitious target: greenhouse gas emis-
sions associated with the supply of energy to production are to be 
cut by 40% by 2020 compared with 2010 levels, in line with the 
German Government’s target. Alongside efficient, resource-con-
serving  production and intelligent mobility concepts, the develop-
ment of eco-friendly vehicles is a major focus of our activities.  
By 2020, we are aiming to reduce the CO2 emissions of our Euro-
pean new-car fleet to 95 g/km (CO2/km). We also aim to make 
 every new  Volkswagen gene ration between 10 and 15% more 
 efficient than its predecessor. 
Our lifecycle-based approach to resource conservation means 
that our developers are committed to making the environmental 
characteristics of each new model better than those of its prede-
cessor, and we have embedded this goal in our Group Environ-
mental Principles Product.
To firmly anchor this principle in our corporate conscience, we have 
devised a modular structure based around the business areas at 
 every stage of the value chain. Not only do we address environmental 
issues relating to production and the products themselves; we also 
extend this approach to logistics and recycling. We have defined a 
fixed organizational and reporting structure to manage these top-
ics, and those responsible systematically share best practices in a 
global network. In the reporting year 2013, we held a Group-wide 
strategy workshop with all business areas, culminating in the com-
pilation of an ambitious raft of measures and the definition of clear 
responsibilities and reporting structures.
challenges and Goals
The serious risks associated with climate change pose a central 
challenge for the  Volkswagen Group. The Group-wide risk man-
agement system therefore analyzes every risk from a quantitative 
and qualitative perspective and rates it according to defined indi-
cators (see page 23). At the same time, climate change is trans-
forming customer requirements and creating fresh opportuni-
ties.  Volkswagen is developing a growing number of new 
technologies, products and services to address the challenges 
 associated with climate change, from eco-friendly vehicles and 
supplementary services, to fuel-saver driving courses and energy 
products for mobility and beyond. For example, we offer: 
 > A unique portfolio of 324 low-consumption model variants 
with emissions of 120 g CO2/km or less, including 54 model 
variants with emissions below 100 g CO2/km.

By 2018 the  Volkswagen Group wants to become the world’s most sustainable automobile  
manufacturer and has set itself some ambitious environmental targets in order to achieve this.  
 In 2013 we moved a significant step closer to meeting our goals in terms of production,  
product  design and intelligent mobility concepts. And with our broad-based Powertrain and Fuel 
Strategy, we are also on the right track in commercial terms.

our commitment to Emission targets
In March 2013, we announced that the Group was planning 
to reduce the fuel consumption of its new-car fleet even further 
than originally planned. We aim to meet the European Union’s 
average emission target of 95 g CO2/km by 2020. The   Volkswagen 
Group is the first car manufacturer to commit to this ambitious 
target, which equates to an average fuel consumption of less 
than four liters (4.1 l petrol, 3.6 l diesel) per 100 km across all 
segments and vehicle classes. Greenpeace Germany called this 
decision an “important symbol of commitment to environmen-
tal protection and society, and to the mass production of 
 climate-friendly technical solutions”. With our intermediate 
target of reducing CO2 emissions from the European new-car 
fleet to 120 g CO2/km by 2015 we will already be 12 g below the 
legal requirement. The current Group Environmental Princi-
ples Product also stipulate requirements on CO2 reductions. 
The Group reports regularly on its climate protection strategy to 
the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), a 
consortium of institutional investors. In September 2013, CDP 
 listed us in their Performance and Disclosure Leadership Index 
for the first time and in the same year presented the Group with 
an award for its performance.
95 g co2 per kilometer by 2020: 
  Volkswagen Group is backing the
European emissions target.
In China, the  Volkswagen Group is launching the biggest invest-
ment program in the country’s automotive history. Of the €9.8 
billion earmarked for the expansion of manufacturing capacity 
by 2015, more than two thirds will be invested in high-efficiency 
products and resource-conserving production. Average fuel 
consumption by the 70 plus models in the fleet had already been 
reduced by 20% between 2005 and 2010, and a further 11% will 
be cut by 2015.  Volkswagen already meets legal requirements on 
fleet consumption in China that came into force in 2012, and 
has ambitious plans to reduce this still further over the next few 
years, not least by boosting the efficiency of its engines and in-
troducing alternative powertrains. These efforts will be assisted 
by a drive to build local research and development expertise.

our Policy and Principles
Environmental protection in the  Volkswagen Group rests on our 
global principles, which are binding for all Group brands: 
 > Group Environmental Policy: First adopted in 1995, this 
 policy provides the framework for all environmental activities 
of the brands and companies. 
 39
 > Group Environmental Principles Sites/Production (2007): 
Include production processes, infrastructure and general 
principles. 
 40
 > Environmental Principles Product (2008): Focusing on the 
aspects of climate, resources and health, these principles state 
that over its entire lifecycle, every new vehicle model should 
 exhibit superior environmental characteristics to its predeces-
sor. 
 41
 > Mission Statement on Biodiversity (2008): We recognize our 
responsibility for species conservation and show that it is pos-
sible to successfully combine the requirements of material 
 production with the conservation of biodiversity, in keeping with 
our philosophy of sustainable development.

Man’s clIMatE stRatEGy 2020
In 2011, MAN adopted its own climate strategy incorporating five core 
initiatives. 
 44 The company reports annually on the progress 
made in these areas as part of its sustainability reporting:
 > 25% reduction in CO2 emissions at MAN production sites by 2020 
(baseline 2008)
 > consistently efficient product portfolio
 > customer involvement and dialogue
 > potential for reducing CO2 emissions along the product life cycle
 > climate strategy management using relevant performance indica-
tors.
As MAN became part of the  Volkswagen Group in 2012, MAN’s 
 Climate Strategy, which was signed off in 2011, differs from the 
 Volkswagen Group’s Environmental and Sustainability Strategy, 
which has a target date of 2018.
All those responsible at Group headquarters, within the brands 
and at the sites are urged to comply with these environmental prin-
ciples in every decision they take. The brands are free to formulate 
their own, farther-reaching environmental management guide-
lines and principles, should they wish. For example, based on the 
environmental principles, the  Volkswagen brand has defined 
more stringent Environmental Goals for Technical Development 
relating to climate protection, resource conservation and health 
protection, and set specific targets within the framework of its 
“Think Blue. Engineering.” initiative.

together with decision-makers from all relevant brands and 
 areas. They draw on internal management and analysis tools 
such as Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and the CO2 Registry, a 
tool which checks every Group vehicle project to gauge its 
 contribution to the fleet CO2 target. Environmental officers 
at our European sites have been sharing their knowledge and 
 experience since 1976. Regular Group Environmental Confer-
ences were introduced in 1998 as a forum for the Group’s envi-
ronmental officers and experts to discuss strategies, measures 
and projects. Work centers around the preparation of action 
plans which are subsequently discussed and adopted. Effective 
Group-wide environmental controlling supports these activities 
and provides a yardstick of progress for the  Volkswagen Group. 
Regular Group Environmental conferences 
have been held since 1998.
 
We have also established a Group-wide network of climate and 
energy experts to foster knowledge-sharing between all brands 
and regions. As well as exchanging best practices, participants 
are also encouraged to engage in debate with international 
 scientists, experts and other stakeholders.
Environmental Management system
The Group-wide environmental management system provides 
the organizational basis for meeting the Group’s environmental 
targets.  Volkswagen ensures Group-wide compliance with all 
 relevant national legislation. Building on the Group’s Environ-
mental Policy and Environmental Principles, all brands are 
 required to organize their environmental management systems 
autonomously in line with international standards. The Chief 
 Environment Officer (Group Research) is responsible for the 
 environmental management system at  Volkswagen AG and at the 
Technical Development department of the  Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand. Since 1995, the  Volkswagen brand’s German sites 
have participated in EMAS (the European Eco-Management and 
Audit Scheme) while its production sites worldwide have under-
gone environmental certification procedures to international 
standard ISO 14001. The brand has been driving forward certifi-
cation of its energy management systems to ISO 50001 since 2009. 
One particularly important factor here is to inform the employees 
and involve them in the management systems. To this end an in-
tranet portal has been created to showcase best practice examples 
and facilitate  direct contact with those responsible for their imple-
mentation. The portal also outlines basic regulations and provides 
tips on saving energy, including some generated by the central 
ideas management system. Nearly all of the  Volkswagen brand’s 
European sites have now been certified to the new energy manage-
ment standard ISO 50001. Other sites will follow over the next few 
years. In 1995, the  Volkswagen brand’s Technical Development 
department established an environmental management system 
for the “development of motor vehicles with continuously improved 
environmental properties” to ISO 14001. Now in its 18th year, the 
system successfully completed its sixth recertification in 2013. 
Since 2009, the Technical Development environmental manage-
ment system has also been aligned with ISO TR 14062.

PRIZE foR GREEn contRollInG
In November 2013, the  Volkswagen brand was awarded the “Green 
Controlling Prize” by the International Controllers’ Association (ICV) 
for its successful environmental controlling through the “Think 
Blue. Factory” program. The jury praised the fact that the con-
trolling system did not merely track and report ratios, but also in-
corporated many change management control tools. The particular 
challenge here is to map the high real net output of the 27 sites 
worldwide, and to ensure that highly complex data and measure-
ment variables are reliably and consistently recorded.
Greenhouse Gas Inventory tool (scope 3)
The  Volkswagen Group published its first Scope 3 Inventory for 
CO2 emissions (see page 133) as part of the 2012 Group Sustain-
ability Report. In conjunction with the Scope 3 Standard pub-
lished in 2011 by the World Business Council for Sustainable 
 Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute (WRI), 
the present report analyzes CO2 emissions for twelve out of a 
 total of 15 Scope 3 categories. The data reveals that more than 
93% of the total Scope 3 volume is generated in the emissions 
 categories “Purchased goods and services” and “Use phase”. The 
data in these two categories are validated by external auditors 
from  PricewaterhouseCoopers in accordance with the stan-
dard: ISAE 3000 International Standard on Assurance Engage-
ments.

Across the world, the introduction of regulations to curb CO2 emis-
sions is continuing. In Europe the limit for new-car fleet-average 
emissions will be reduced to 95 g CO2/km by 2021. At the same 
time, energy is becoming more expensive and raw materials in-
creasingly scarce. These factors, along with increasing urbaniza-
tion and the worldwide growth in goods and traffic flows, define 
the parameters within which the  Volkswagen Group conducts its 
core business as a mobility provider, and help to explain our focus 
on combating climate change. We are carrying out large-scale in-
vestment in research and development with the aim of achieving 
our ambitious environmental goals, and in order to become mar-
ket leader in the field of electric mobility. And we are progressively 
integrating environmental considerations into our value chain 
and across all Group brands and companies.
our Powertrain and fuel strategy
The  Volkswagen Group is facing up to the challenge of innovative 
powertrain development. In 2013 alone, our research and devel-
opment spending totaled approximately €10.2 billion. Much of 
this investment was devoted to reducing the CO2 emissions of our 
new-vehicle fleet, within the framework of our Powertrain and 
Fuel Strategy. Under this strategy we are continuing the electrifi-
cation of the model range, increasing the number of natural-gas 
vehicles and steadily improving the efficiency of our gasoline and 
diesel engines. As a result of these efforts, the  Volkswagen Group 
has become the world’s leading innovator in the field of power-
train technology, according to the Center of Automotive Manage-
ment (CAM). CAM published the results of its latest comparison of 
the powertrain development activities and innovative capability of 
20 international automobile manufacturers in December 2013. 
The high quality and large number of its powertrain innovations 
meant that the  Volkswagen Group was able to extend its leadership 
over the previous year.

Research and Development Projects
Together with partners from the field of industry and research, 
in 2013 we again took part in a range of industry-leading joint 
 research projects:
Lightweight design: With the new Golf, the Technical Develop-
ment department has succeeded in turning the tide of spiraling 
weight. The new-generation model is lighter than its predecessor. 
Thanks to extensive lightweight design measures, weight has been 
reduced by as much as 100 kg, depending on specification level, 
and even more in the case of the Golf estate. The Automotive 
 Research Centre Niedersachsen (NFF) is stepping up its focus on 
lightweight design with the construction of an Open Hybrid 
 LabFactory at its Wolfsburg site, where it will be researching 
new  development and production methods in cooperation with 
 Volkswagen and suppliers. The NFF is a research center set up in 
2007 with the support of the Lower Saxony state government and 
the  Volkswagen Group to serve as a platform for cooperation be-
tween industry and science.
At the same time, we are working with Laser Zentrum Hannover 
e.V. (LZH) and other partners to develop a laser process for the 
 automated cutting of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) com-
ponents. This would allow this lightweight material to be used in 
automotive mass production, thereby reducing vehicle weight – 
which will be one of the most crucial parameters in automotive 
design and production in the future. If cars based on CFRP are to 
be massproduced in future, then automated production technolo-
gies – in particular cutting technologies – are essential. In the 
joint project “HolQueSt 3D”, seven partners from industry and 
 research, led by  Volkswagen, are working together to develop a 
process for 3-D high-performance laser machining of CFRP 
 lightweight structures.

New materials for e-mobility: The limited battery capacity of 
electric vehicles means that efficient temperature management is 
one of the technical challenges that have to be addressed when de-
veloping electric mobility. Cooling of the passenger compartment 
in summer and heating of the passenger compartment in winter 
means taking valuable energy away from the high-voltage battery, 
significantly reducing the range of the electric vehicle. Valuable 
energy can be saved, and the vehicle’s driving range extended, by 
using new materials to assist cabin temperature management. 
The e-STROM initiative, which runs from 2013 to 2016, is develop-
ing concepts based on innovative materials that will provide a 
 basis for efficient temperature management in electric vehicles. 
The aim of the project is to reduce the climate-control-related 
drain on the battery at all times of the year, so that use of com-
fort-related vehicle functions does not impact on the driving range 
of electric vehicles. The joint project, coordinated by  Volkswagen 
Group  Research, is being supported by the German Ministry for 
Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the government’s high-
 tech strategy.
Intelligent grid integration of electric vehicles: A further pilot 
project launched in 2013 and coordinated by  Volkswagen Group 
Research is the INEES project on intelligent grid integration of 
electric vehicles and provision of grid support services. The project 
has been awarded “Lighthouse Project” status by the German 
 Environment Ministry. The idea is that electric vehicles would 
form a local energy buffer of significant size that would help to 
 stabilize the grid by offsetting fluctuations in production of wind 
and solar power. As and when required, the batteries of electric 
cars in this buffer – provided they were coupled to a charging 
station – would be able to flexibly feed power back into the grid. 
This would help to stabilize the grid during periods when the 
amount of power being generated was temporarily not sufficient 
to meet demand. 
Goal: to be market leader 
in electric mobility by 2018.
 
our Electric Mobility Program
Our goals for 2018 also include becoming the electric vehicle (EV) 
market leader by this date. By the end of 2014, a total of 14 models 
from various Group brands will already feature an all-electric or 
hybrid powertrain. If there is sufficient demand, up to 40 new 
models could be fitted with alternative powertrains. We have 
 already built up the necessary know-how for electric motors and 
battery systems at our own components plants. We began manu-
facturing battery systems at the Braunschweig plant in Germany 
in March 2013 and have also trained almost 70,000 development, 
production and service staff in EV technology – the biggest train-
ing initiative of its kind in our industry. The Modular Transverse 
Matrix platform (MQB, see page 38) is key to a speedy and cost-effi-
cient introduction of electric mobility across all brands and vehicle 
classes. From the outset, the MQB was designed to cater for electric 
powertrain technology as it takes account of all types of power-
train, including systems of the future. The common engine mount-
ing position not only reduces the number of engine/transmission 
combinations, it also means that alternative powertrains, too, can 
be integrated in the vehicle with a minimum of effort. The heavy 
investment in this system is now paying big dividends in terms of 
the speed and cost efficiency with which it is allowing the 
 Volkswagen Group to get alternative all-electric, fuel cell or plug-
in hybrid powertrains into production. The MQB is therefore a 
foundation not only for economical and resource-saving produc-
tion but also at the same time key to rolling out efficient mobility 
concepts for the future (see page 96). 
On the new e-mobility Internet portal, launched in November 
2013, the  Volkswagen brand is showcasing its electric vehicles and 
EV-related ideas and technologies. It all began with the NILS con-
cept car and today  Volkswagen already has the Touareg Hybrid•, 
Jetta Hybrid•, the limited-production XL-1• and the all-electric 
e-up!• on the market.

SEAT concluded its CENIT VERDE electric mobility project in 
2013. In the course of this four-year research project, more than 
800 professionals from 16 companies and 14 public research 
centers and universities, led by Centro Técnico de SEAT, came to-
gether to develop EV automotive technology, infrastructures and 
energy systems. The project results were presented in the form of 
the “SEAT Leon VERDE•” prototype, a plug-in hybrid based on the 
new Leon. The project has broadened the technological know-
how and competitiveness of the participating companies and pro-
moted the technologies necessary for a general roll-out of electric 
mobility. SEAT is continuing to supply plug-in hybrids and electric 
vehicles to company fleets for quality testing and improvement 
purposes.
tHE E-UP!• – tHE nEW bEncHMaRk
In 2013, the  Volkswagen brand presented its first production electric 
car: the e-up!•. From launch, the e-up!• was also backed up by ex-
tensive services:
 > In cooperation with Bosch Automotive Service Solutions, 
 Volkswagen is offering a complete wallbox-plus-installation pack-
age for vehicle charging. The wallbox reduces the charging time 
required, compared with the standard solution, to six hours.
 > If “BluePower” electricity is used, e-up! drivers can not only drive 
with zero tailpipe emissions, they can also charge their vehicle on 
carbon-neutral electricity, produced by hydroelectric power sta-
tions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In this case, operation 
of the first all-electric volume-production model from  Volkswagen 
has a zero carbon footprint along the entire energy chain. The 
green power is supplied in cooperation with partners LichtBlick 
and  Volkswagen Bank.

the “think blue.” Philosophy
The “Think Blue.” philosophy expresses the  Volkswagen brand’s 
thinking on environmental sustainability, looking in particular 
at the question of how to balance personal mobility with good 
 environmental practice. At the same time this internationally 
 focused strategy adopts a perspective that goes far beyond the 
products and technologies themselves. It inspires and motivates 
customers and the public at large to contribute ideas and input and 
looks to  engage with a wide range of environmental organizations 
throughout the world, in a variety of ways. 
 50 
One of  Volkswagen’s priorities as an automotive manufacturer  is 
to develop eco-friendly products and technical solutions, focus-
ing amongst other things on fuel-efficient technologies, on elec-
tric mobility that caters to everyday needs, and on innovative 
 mobility concepts like the carsharing project “Quicar” or the 
“Think Blue. Factory.” program (see pages 14, 104). In each 
market, “Think Blue.” activities focus on the most urgent envi-
ronmental challenges in that particular country – for example 
in Mexico and Spain measures against soil erosion, or in South 
 Africa biodiversity conservation. “Think Blue.” also aims to 
raise public awareness of the importance of sustainability and 
involve the public in this “rethinking” process, not least by 
coming up with entertaining ideas to promote awareness of 
 fuel-efficient driving techniques (see page 112) .

Since 2010, “Think Blue.” has been steadily evolving and taking 
root in the various business units of the  Volkswagen brand right 
across the value chain. This starts at the planning and vehicle 
 design stage, where the Technical Development department has 
set ambitious goals in terms of an integrated approach to climate 
protection, resource conservation and health protection through-
out the product life cycle. Since late 2012 this strategy, known as 
“Think Blue. Engineering.”, has brought together all programs 
and measures aimed at improving the life cycle environmental 
performance of new vehicle models, based on the environmental 
goals of the Technical Development department. Environmental 
aspects are identified at an early stage and taken into account 
across the entire product life cycle. In 2013,  Volkswagen Research 
and Development created the “Think Blue. Engineering. Awards” 
to promote special projects that can make an important contribu-
tion to climate protection, resource conservation and health pro-
tection.
In addition to the ongoing technological development of products 
and production processes, the  Volkswagen brand has also 
launched a “Think Blue.” campaign to reduce CO2 emissions at its 
authorized dealers in Germany by 25% by 2020. From 2014, an 
eco-efficiency advisory service for all dealerships will suggest 
possible improvement measures. Particularly eco-friendly deal-
erships will be issued with the “Future Climate® inspired by 
Think Blue.” certificate. More information about “Think Blue.” 
and about current projects can be found at www.volkswagen.

All the brands have launched initiatives to identify potential and  
to develop strategies and solutions for achieving the  Volkswagen 
Group’s sustainability objectives. In 2013, SEAT launched ECOMO-
TIVE FACTORY, an umbrella initiative for all production-related envi-
ronmental activities. The aim of this project is to put SEAT vehicles 
at the forefront of environmentally friendly production by 2018. To 
achieve this goal, a variety of production-related environmental 
protection measures have been adopted that will lead to a reduc-
tion of up to 25% in electricity and water consumption, CO2 emis-
sions, emissions of volatile organic compounds and waste output. 
ŠKODA has grouped its sustainability efforts within its GreenFuture 
strategy. Based on the three pillars GreenProduct, GreenFactory 
and GreenRetail, ŠKODA is aiming to increase its portfolio of 
eco-friendly cars and produce and sell them in a sustainable man-
ner. Scania’s green strategy, known as “Ecolution by Scania”, aims to 
reduce customers’ energy consumption and CO2 emissions not only 
at the product development stage but also through optimized 
 vehicle operation, driver training and the ideal maintenance. Audi 
will be expanding its “ultra” model strategy in 2014, with eleven 
new models. In the A4, A5 and A6 ranges, a new, powerful and high-
ly efficient 2-liter TDI engine will be launched, developing 100 kW 
(136 PS), 120 kW (163 PS) and 140 kW (190 PS), with emissions rang-
ing from just 104 to 119 g CO2, depending on the model.

We look to develop products that will make the most efficient pos-
sible use of energy, fuel and resources. The  Volkswagen Group 
develops all vehicles and technologies with the goal of improving 
on the environmental performance of their predecessors. That 
means for example that every new vehicle generation from the 
 Volkswagen brand must be between 10 and 15% more efficient 
than its predecessor. At the same time  Volkswagen was also 
the first automaker to commit to the ambitious goal of reducing 
its European new-car fleet-average emissions to 95 g CO2/km by 
2020. 
In order to achieve this, we seek to minimize the environmental 
impact of our products from the very earliest stages of the devel-
opment process. In accordance with the Group Environmental 
Principles Product, we aim to continuously improve our products 
with particular reference to climate protection, resource con-
servation and health protection. The figures prove that our prod-
uct development strategy is making good headway. The average 
CO2 emissions of our European fleet were reduced from 159 to 
128 g CO2/km between 2008 and 2013 (EU 28, including Croatia 
from July 1, 2013) – a fall of approximately 19%. A total of 324 
model variants emit less than 120 g CO2/km and 54 model vari-
ants already emit less than 100 g CO2/km.  
EnVIRonMEntal MEntoRs
At the  Volkswagen brand, responsibility for product-related envi-
ronmental protection lies with the Environment Officer Product 
and is integrated into the  Volkswagen management structure. The 
Environment Officer Product initiates and monitors environmental 
improvements that go far beyond statutory legal requirements 
across the entire product development process. He is assisted by 
environmental mentors who are assigned to new-vehicle projects 
from the earliest planning stages through to the start of produc-
tion, and who contribute their know-how across the entire develop-
ment process. The environmental mentors use a wide range of 
 inhouse and external analysis tools, materials data systems and 
controlling instruments to assess the vehicle right down to compo-
nent level.
life cycle Engineering
The term “Life Cycle Engineering” means improving the environ-
mental footprint of the vehicle over its entire life cycle. This pro-
cess begins with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), in which the envi-
ronmental impacts of the vehicle are assessed across the full life 
cycle – from resource extraction, through production and opera-

tion to eventual recycling. Amongst other things, a Life Cycle 
 Assessment reveals the quantitative variations in environmental 
impacts over the different phases of the vehicle’s life cycle. In the 
case of conventional petrol or diesel vehicles for example, it reveals 
that most CO2 – approximately three quarters – is emitted in the 
use phase. The fraction emitted at the manufacturing stage is 
much smaller. In the case of water on the other hand, the picture is 
quite different. Even if it is regularly washed, the consumption of 
water during the vehicle’s useful life is very low. Most water is con-
sumed at earlier stages in the life cycle (see page 106). 
Established Group-wide in 2013:  
the Corporate Working Group “Life 
Cycle Engineering”.
 
Analyzing the life cycle environmental impact of a vehicle is a com-
plex task. For the production phase, data must be inventoried for 
all components and all processes. This data is drawn from vehicle 
parts lists, the  Volkswagen Material Information System (MISS) 
and external databases. From these various sources, a Life Cycle 
Inventory is prepared using a  Volkswagen-developed IT tool. Fuel 
consumption and emissions during the use phase are calculated 
for the entire useful life of the vehicle, using the statutory New Eu-
ropean Driving Cycle (NEDC). In addition to driving emissions, 
the use phase emissions also include emissions from fuel produc-
tion processes. Finally, for the last phase of the life cycle – recy-
cling – energy consumption and emissions for dismantling and 
recycling the end-of-life vehicle are calculated.
In a further step, the inventoried data on emissions is then classi-
fied into environmental impact categories. CO2 and methane for 
example contribute to the category “global warming”. The other 
environmental impact categories considered are photochemical 
ozone creation, acidification, ozone depletion and eutrophication 
potential. The results of the Life Cycle Assessment, which is car-
ried out in strict compliance with the ISO 14040 and 14044 inter-
national standards on Life Cycle Assessments, allow the company 
to identify the most ecologically advantageous solutions at an early 
stage. Based on these findings, development work can then be 
geared to achieving the greatest possible environmental benefits 
over the entire life cycle of the product.

In 2013 the Corporate Working Group “Life Cycle Engineering” 
was set up, in which experts from the brands are working to 
harmonize the guidelines and methodology for Life Cycle As-
sessments across the entire Group and to support best prac-
tice-sharing among successful Life Cycle Engineering projects. 
Environmental commendations and life cycle 
 assessments
For selected models, the  Volkswagen brand publishes Environ-
mental Commendations, which inform customers and the gener-
al public about the ecological progress represented by the new 
model at life cycle level, compared with its predecessors. The com-
parison is based on the detailed Life Cycle Assessments described 
above, which are certified for  Volkswagen by independent auditor 
TÜV NORD to confirm that they are based on reliable data and 
were drawn up in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14040 
and 14044. By the end of 2013,  Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
 Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles had published a total of 18 
 Environmental Commendations.

Since 2010, Audi has been producing Life Cycle Assessments for 
new model series and publishing them at market launch. Life 
 Cycle Assessments have been published for the Audi A3, the Audi 
A6 and the Audi e-gas project. In 2013, SEAT published a “Carpeta

its key environmental data. Also, for the first time, a Life Cycle 
 Assessment was carried out for the SEAT Leon. 
new Models from the brands
The  Volkswagen Group believes in the importance of offering a 
 diversity of different technologies. This broad-based approach 
 differentiates the company from its competitors (see page 94). 
Alongside the further improvement of petrol (TSI) and diesel (TDI) 
models, the Group’s technologies and development activities  
also span natural-gas vehicles, all-electric vehicles and hybrid ve-
hicles with battery and fuel-cell technology. This comprehensive 
approach supports the corporate goal of developing attractive and 
affordable vehicles to cater to the widest possible spectrum of 
 requirements. These vehicles must use scarce resources as effi-
ciently as possible and at the same time offer highest standards of 
comfort and convenience.
Efficiency Models (tsI and tDI) 2013
 Volkswagen. The third generation of the Golf TDI BlueMotion• 
was presented by  Volkswagen in spring 2013. This vehicle’s fuel 
consumption of just 3.2 liters of diesel per 100 km and emissions 
of 85 g CO2/km (NEDC) are among the best in its class. The low 
fuel consumption is largely down to the newly developed four- 
cylinder 110 PS diesel engine. In line with corporate objectives, 
the engineers achieved a 15% reduction in fuel consumption 
over the  predecessor model. The Golf TDI BlueMotion• is 
equipped with  automatic stop-start functionality and braking 
energy recuperation. Aerodynamic refinements, low vehicle 
weight, the modified six-speed manual transmission and extra 
low rolling-resistance tires are further factors contributing to 
high fuel efficiency. 
With the Caddy BlueMotion•, unveiled in 2013,  Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles presented a version of the popular urban 
delivery van which consumes up to 1.1 l/km less fuel than a  Caddy 
without BlueMotion. The fuel consumption of 4.5 l/100 km is 
Scania Euro VI engines set standards for how to meet even the strictest 
emission regulations.
The SEAT Leon is the model with the lowest emissions in its segment. 
achieved  using a variety of aerodynamic and technical modifi-
cations – for example it features start-stop functionality, low 
rolling resistance tires, reduced ride height and braking ener-
gy recuperation. 
Audi. The most fuel-efficient production model of the Audi brand 
is the 110-PS Audi A3 1.6 TDI ultra• which, despite its comfort-
able specification, boasts fuel consumption of 3.2 l/100 km, cor-
responding to CO2 emissions of just 85 g/km. This new A3 model 
version entered the market in fall 2013. It is the most efficient 
model in the current Audi range, and is also the brand’s first 
model to bear the “ultra” badge. This label stands for Audi’s 
 commitment to systematic sustainability in its products and 
 production processes. 
trucks are constantly in use,  
so efficiency improvements generate 
even bigger benefits.
 
Scania. In July 2013, Scania Germany reported shipment of 
its 1,000th Euro VI compliant truck, a Scania R 440. And in 
2011, Scania had already become the first manufacturer to put 
Euro VI-engined trucks on the road. The Euro VI standard reduces 
the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate emissions limits of 
Euro V regulations by approximately 80%.
The Scania Streamline range of G- and R-series long-haul trucks 
are optimized for low fuel consumption. To maximize fuel savings, 
their automatic transmission’s new Economy mode is fully inte-
grated with the Scania Active Prediction cruise control system. 
Together with the new, more efficient second-generation Euro VI 
engines this enables fuel savings in long-distance haulage of up to 
8%. Euro VI will be mandatory for all newly registered heavy-duty

vehicles from January 2014 and for newly registered vehicles of all 
types from September 2014.
In the second half of 2013 Scania presented its Eco-roll system, 
which can cut customers’ fuel costs by up to 2%. Eco-roll calcu-
lates the exact point at which the truck can start to use gravity on 
downhill stretches. On long descents, this system decides whether 
it is more fuel-efficient for the truck to use gravity to coast downhill 
with the transmission in neutral and the engine idling, or whether 
to use the engine brake with the fuel supply shut off.
SEAT. With its reduced CO2 emissions of just 85 g/km, the Leon 
1.6 TDI CR 110 CV Ecomotive•  set a new milestone at its launch in 
late 2013, with the lowest emissions of any vehicle in its segment. 
Ecomotive versions with reduced emissions are available for all 
the other models in the SEAT range too. In these versions the 
 Ibiza•  and Ibiza ST•  achieve 88 g/km, the Toledo• 99 g/km, the 
 Altea•  and Altea XL•  111 g/km and the Alhambra•  143 g/km. 
ŠKODA. Despite adverse weather conditions, record-breaking 
driver Gerhard Plattner recorded fuel consumption of just 
2.7 l/100 km with a standard ŠKODA Fabia Combi GreenLine• 
model in the “Trans-Germany Economy Drive” in October 2013. 
This is a 0.3 l/100 km improvement on the official fuel consump-
tion of 3 l/100 km. This thrifty performance comes amongst 
 other things from braking energy recuperation, the start-stop 
system and aerodynamic refinements.

natural-Gas Models 2013
 Volkswagen. The IAA Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2013 
saw the world debut of the Golf TGI BlueMotion• (the TGI badge 
is used to denote  Volkswagen’s natural-gas-capable models). Its 
 110-PS four-cylinder engine operates on both natural gas and on 
petrol. Natural gas is used as the default fuel, the system automati-
cally switching to petrol when the CNG tank is empty. Natural-gas 
consumption is just 3.5 kg/100 km, with CO2 emissions of 92 g/km 
for vehicles with DSG dual-clutch gearbox, and 94 g/km for vehi-
cles with manual transmission. The Golf TGI BlueMotion• is the 
seventh natural-gas vehicle in the  Volkswagen line-up. It joins the 
eco up!•, Touran TSI EcoFuel•, Passat TSI EcoFuel•, Passat Estate 
TSI EcoFuel•, Caddy EcoFuel• and Caddy Maxi Eco-Fuel•. 
Audi. The Audi A3 sportback g-tron•, which went into production 
in Ingolstadt in December 2013, returns average fuel  consumption 
of between 3.2 and 3.3 kg of CNG per 100 km. CO2 emissions are 
just 88 to 92 g/km. And if its runs on Audi e-gas, which is produced 
from CO2 and green electricity, the A3 sportback g-tron• is virtual-
ly carbon-neutral, emitting exactly the same amount of CO2 when 
the fuel is burnt as was absorbed when manufacturing the fuel in 
the first place. 
SEAT. SEAT is focusing its efforts on cutting the CO2 emissions 
of its entire model range. The Mii 1.0 MPI Ecofuel Ecomotive•, 
launched in 2012, is still one of the cleanest cars on the market 
and at 79 g/km has the lowest emissions in the range.
ŠKODA. The ŠKODA Citigo CNG• emits just 79 g CO2/km – normal-
ly, that is. Because depending on how the car is driven this figure 
can be substantially reduced. On a fuel-saver run from Italy to 
Sweden in the summer of 2013, this long-distance all-rounder 
consumed an average of 2.4 kg of natural gas per 100 km, which 
equates to just 65 g CO2/km. The CNG version of the ŠKODA Citigo• 
features impressive efficiency. Its 3-cylinder 1-liter engine has an 
output of 68 PS. With average fuel consumption of just 2.9 kg of 
 natural gas per 100 km, the Citigo• ranks among the world’s most 
fuel-efficient and cost-effective vehicles. 
tHE aUDI E-Gas PRojEct 
In June 2013, Audi became the world’s first vehicle manufacturer to 
open its own power-to-gas plant – in Werlte, Germany. This project 
presents a solution to one of the big challenges facing Germany’s 
“energy transition”, by offering a way of storing renewable electric-
ity independently of where it is generated, in large quantities and 
over long periods. The plant first of all splits water into its compo-
nent oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen is then reacted 
with waste CO2 from a biogas plant to produce synthetic methane 
– Audi e-gas. This gas, which is  virtually identical to fossil-based 
natural gas, is fed into the natural gas grid and distributed to CNG 
filling stations. The plant began supplying Audi e-gas to the grid in 
late 2013. Annual production of the Audi facility is expected to be in 
the region of 1,000 t of e-gas, absorbing 2,800 t of CO2 in the pro-
cess. The amount of e-gas produced in Werlte would enable 1,500 
Audi A3 sportback g-tron• models to travel 15,000 km a year in 
 virtually carbon-neutral style. In parallel with the e-gas plant in 
Werlte, Audi is also operating a demonstration facility in Hobbs, 
New  Mexico, USA, in collaboration with a partner, for the produc-
tion of e-ethanol and e-diesel. At this facility, microorganisms use 
water (brackish, salt or wastewater), sunlight and carbon dioxide 
to produce high-purity fuels. Both these projects use CO2 as a raw 
 material for fuels. 
Hybrid Models 2013
 Volkswagen. The XL1• is the first “one-liter” car (100 km on 1 l of 
fuel) in the world.  Volkswagen began building this limited-pro-
duction model – 200 units will be built for customers plus 50 units 
which will remain with VW – in 2013. With emissions of 21 g CO2/
km and fuel consumption of 0.9 l of diesel or 7.2 kWh of electricity 
per 100 km, the XL1• is at the forefront of technology development 
at  Volkswagen. No other plug-in hybrid based on an electric motor 
and diesel internal combustion engine is more fuel-efficient. In 
electric mode, the XL1• can travel for up to 50 km with zero emis-
sions. It represents the current automotive state of the art in terms 
of drive technology, electronics, battery technology, aerodynam-
ics and lightweight design. The body of the XL1• consists primarily 
of lightweight, strong carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), giv-
ing the vehicle an unladen weight of just 795 kg. To get this vehicle 
into production,  Volkswagen had to achieve the previously impos-
sible in terms of both technologies and production processes. The 
extensively CFRP-based XL1• is built using an all-new process 
 similar to hand-built production.
2013 also saw the market debut of the European version of the 
 Jetta Hybrid•. This vehicle is powered by a high-tech gasoline 
 engine (TSI, 110 kW/150 PS) and a 20-kW electric motor. The 
 standard-fitted transmission is an automatic seven-speed dual- 
clutch gearbox. With average fuel consumption of 4.1 l/100 km  
(95 g CO2/km), this sporty saloon offers 20% better economy than 
a comparably powered conventional-drive car. The Jetta Hybrid• 
automatically switches to all-electric mode whenever possible. 
All-electric mode can also be selected manually, at the press of  
a button, providing zero-emission mobility over a distance of up 
to 2 km, at speeds up to 70 km/h.

MAN. The MAN Lion’s City Hybrid city bus made its successful 
market debut in Munich in 2010. In the meantime it is already on 
line-service duty in Barcelona, Paris and many other cities. With 
its serial hybrid drive system, this low-floor bus offers up to 30% 
fuel savings, with a corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions. It 
also stores braking energy and transforms it into power for its two 
electric drive motors. Electrical auxiliary consumers like the 
air-conditioning system are powered by the roof-mounted energy 
accumulator. 
Porsche. In May 2013 the Shanghai Auto Show saw the world 
 debut of the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid•, the world’s first plug-
in hybrid in its class. The 95-PS electric motor is twice as powerful 
as on the predecessor model, contributing to a combined output 
of 416 PS. The energy for the electric motor is supplied by a 
 newly developed lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 9.4 kWh, 
over five times that of the previous nickel-metal hydride battery. 
The  battery can be recharged in two-and-a-half hours at an 
 industrial power socket, and in less than four hours at a standard 
German household power socket. The fuel consumption of the 
Panamera S E-Hybrid• is 3.1 l/100 km – an improvement of 4 l/100 
km over the previous model. CO2 emissions are 71 g/km. The 
 real-world electric driving range is between 18 and 36 kilometers. 
The Panamera S E-Hybrid’s• top speed in all-electric mode is 
135 km/h. 
2013 also saw the launch of Porsche’s first hybrid super sports car, 
the 918 Spyder•. This model combines racetrack-derived technolo-
gy with minimal fuel consumption – despite developing maximum 
output of 887 PS, the 918 Spyder• returns fuel consumption of just 
3.1 l/100 km, corresponding to CO2 emissions of 72 g/km. 
Electric Vehicles 2013
 Volkswagen. The e-up!•, which has been on the market since 
 November 2013, is  Volkswagen’s first production electric vehicle. 
Consuming just 11.7 kWh of electricity per 100 km, it offers world-
class efficiency (efficiency class: A+). This four-seater small car is 
powered by a compact 82-PS electric motor, with floor-mounted 
lithium-ion battery pack and power electronics. The electric motor 
supplies its power to the front wheels via a single-speed transmis-
sion. All components, including the battery, were developed by 
 Volkswagen. The average achievable driving range of the e-up!•, 
which has a top speed of 130 km/h, is up to 160 km, depending on 
topography, driving style and payload. The exemplary fuel efficien-
cy of the e-up!• is down to excellent aerodynamics for a vehicle of 
this size, low rolling resistance and efficient powertrain compo-
nents. Further factors are the highly efficient recuperation  system, 
innovative equipment modules and a newly developed, particular-
ly efficient climate control system. 
In the second half of 2013,  Volkswagen presented a further 
all-electric volume-production model – the e-Golf•. This electric 
version of the best-selling Golf will be launched in early 2014. 
 Consuming just 12.7 kWh/100 km, the e-Golf• is the most eco-
nomical electric vehicle in its class. Powered by an 85 kW/115 PS 
electric motor, it boasts a driving range of up to 190 km (NEDC), a 
top speed of 140 km/h and a wide range of efficiency technologies 
 including a recuperation system with a choice of settings, ener-
gy-saving LED headlights and an optional heat pump that reduces 
the energy consumption of the climate control system.
Via the Car-Net online services and the Car-Net website, e-up!• and 
e-Golf• customers can access further useful functions for opti-
mized electric driving. These functions make it possible for them 
to display vehicle data and program a variety of settings irrespec-
tive of the current location of the vehicle. It is also possible to 
 remote-control the charging process via Car-Net. 
With a concept model presented by  Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles at the Geneva Motor Show 2013,  Volkswagen has also illustrat-
ed the potential for electric drive in the light commercial vehicle 
sector. The e-Co-Motion van, offering cargo capacity of 4.6 m³, is 
designed for carbon-neutral urban delivery work, while the e-load 
up! micro van – another concept – is designed to meet the needs of 
service engineers, courier services, delivery drivers and social 
services. The e-load up! is based on the e-up!• model. The van 
 version has a fold-up passenger seat and more than 1 m³ of cargo 
capacity.

The world’s most powerful (100 MW) solar thermal power plant, the 
“Shams 1” facility in Abu Dhabi (shams = “sun” in Arabic), came on 
stream in March 2013. The electricity is generated by the largest 
steam turbine ever built for a solar thermal power station. This tur-
bine, with a gross output of 125 MW, was supplied by MAN Diesel & 
Turbo. The plant uses a dry cooling system that significantly reduces 
water consumption – an important advantage in the desert condi-
tions of Abu Dhabi. Shams 1 is the fifth solar power station to  be 
powered by an MAN turbine. With its “BLUEFIRE” engines, mean-
while, MAN is catering to the trend towards distributed power gen-
eration, and to the need for gas engines and turbines which can 
supply electricity flexibly, on demand. This technology is used for 
example in the 35/44G gas engine, which has a mechanical output 
 of 10.6 MW and electrical efficiency of 47.3%.

Over the next few years, the topic of resource efficiency is going 
to shift even further into the spotlight at the  Volkswagen Group. 
That is because the sparing use of energy and raw materials 
makes a major and growing contribution to cost-effectiveness. 
The  Volkswagen brand’s production sites are already pooling their 
activities under the “Think Blue. Factory.” program, which in-
cludes a raft of ambitious measures and ensures that managers 
and employees at the production plants never lose sight of the 
 objectives.  
 54
Other Group brands are following their lead and have developed 
their own concepts to enhance energy and resource efficiency 
while building employee awareness of these issues (see page 97).
By 2018, the  Volkswagen Group is aiming to have cut specific ener-
gy and water requirements, waste volume and CO2 and solvent 
emissions (VOC) per vehicle by 25%, compared with the 2010 
baseline. This goal applies across the board to all the Group’s 
 production sites, and builds on the general production process 
 requirements defined in the Group’s environmental principles. 
The overarching aim is to minimize the environmental impacts of 
production. By the end of 2013 we were already half-way to our 
goal, having cut the environmental impacts of production by 
12.5%. This was broken down as follows:
 > energy consumption:  
 –12.5%
 > CO2 emissions:  
 –19.5%
 > water consumption:  
 –4.6%
 > solvent emissions:  
–12.3%
 > waste for disposal: 
–13.8%
EURoPEan EMIssIons tRaDInG
In order to ensure that the Group is fully prepared for the third trad-
ing period from 2013, as required by the Data Collection Ordinance 
(DEV 2020), the Group has calculated and reported the demand for 
CO2 emissions at its German sites and applied to the German Emis-
sions Trading Office (DEHSt) for the allocation of corresponding cer-
tificates. Our production sites in other European Union countries 
have likewise been reviewed in line with the valid national legisla-
tion to ensure the timely submission of applications to the respec-
tive national authorities. As far as the Group is concerned, there 
have been no significant changes in the number of facilities and the 
associated quantity of tradable CO2 emissions included in the Euro-
pean emissions trading system since 2013. 
Under the “Think Blue. Factory.” program, new production sites 
are built in accordance with strict environmental criteria. In ex-
isting plants, depending on the age of the production equipment, 
ecological objectives are met either by replacing or upgrading 
 machinery or by redesigning production processes. The experts in 
Wolfsburg collaborate closely with each individual factory and 
 devise customized development plans for each site. The “Think 
Blue. Factory.” toolkit contains various instruments for systemati-
cally reducing the ratios and optimizing consumption. A dedicat-
ed catalog of 140 guide measures for eco-friendly automobile 
 factories is a key element of this toolkit and the appropriate actions 
are selected for each plant. This catalog is constantly evolving, 
 because “Think Blue. Factory.” is a dialogue-driven process in 
which best-practices are rolled out from individual plants to all 
sites. At the same time, production technology at the factories is 
also upgraded in line with the latest advances in manufacturing 
systems and processes. Through this sharing of local best practic-
es, new options and opportunities are continuously being created.
Of the 43 global production sites belonging to the  Volkswagen 
brand, 27 participated in “Think Blue. Factory.” in the reporting 
period. Between the program’s launch in 2011 and the end of 
2013, more than half of the 3,400 planned measures had already 
been implemented. Since 2010, this clearly defined approach has 
led to the following interim results for the  Volkswagen brand: 
 energy consumption is down 18.5%, CO2 emissions have been 
 reduced by 28.4%, waste volumes are down 30.2%, and water 
consumption has been cut back by 11.0%. Solvent emissions have 
 increased by 2.7%.
 
coRPoRatE REsoURcE EffIcIEncy stEERInG GRoUP
We are constantly on the lookout for ways of enhancing material 
and resource efficiency at our production sites, throughout every 
phase of the value creation chain and at every stage of our prod-
ucts’ life cycles. Every employee is encouraged to question everyday 
processes, and to leverage the full potential for ecological innova-
tions and resource efficiency. The Corporate Resource Efficiency 
Steering Group has been tasked with collating best practices and 
making them accessible to all Group brands. In order to raise the 
public visibility of our commitment and create a basis for environ-
mental policy debate, we have decided to publish our Group-wide 
measures in a separate brochure.

saving energy in production
In the reporting period, the intranet-based IT tool “Massnahmen@
web” documented more than 1,260 measures across the Group  
to optimize processes in the fields of energy and environment.  
Energy savings of 381 gigawatt-hours (GWh) and CO2 savings  of 
around 229,000 t were achieved, which translates into cost 
savings of €28.6 million per annum. Noteworthy success was 
achieved by all brands in this respect.

 Volkswagen. Efficiency measures to reduce energy requirements 
in production, coupled with local combined heat and power (CHP) 
plants powered by natural gas, are typical of the energy-saving 
measures used by the  Volkswagen brand. In April 2013, construc-
tion work began on a new CHP plant and two boilers at the Braun-
schweig (Germany) factory. The new systems are driven by a natu-
ral gas engine from MAN Diesel & Turbo with around 84% 
efficiency. With a total output of 46 megawatts (MW), the CHP 
plant will reduce the Group’s CO2 balance sheet by 30,000 t. The 
CHP plant at the Zwickau (Germany) factory is already operation-
al, and meets around 35% of the site’s electricity requirements 
and 50% of its heat requirements, whilst simultaneously reducing 
the CO2 load by 23,000 t per annum. At the Wolfsburg (Germany) 
site, the world’s most technically advanced paintshop for plastic 
vehicle parts is now operational. It uses 50% less energy than the 
old paintshop, while cutting emissions by an impressive 90%.  
At the Emden plant (see page 14), the use of geothermal energy 
saves 12,000 MWh and therefore reduces CO2 emissions by 
1,660 t, while at the same time cutting the annual energy bill 
by €70,000. At the Bratislava (Slovakia) plant, a pilot project to 
 analyze the use of energy in the paintshop culminated in savings 
of 49,000 MWh which equates to 9,800 t of CO2, and bringing cost 
savings of €700,000. 
In 2013, Volkswagen was presented with a “Golden Peacock 
 Environment Management Award” by the Indian Institute of 
 Directors for its eco-friendly production at the Pune (India) plant. 
In March 2013 a state-of-the-art press shop came on stream at 
the Uitenhage plant in South Africa. The new facility forms the 
core of an extensive range of measures that have made Uitenhage 
one of the most eco-friendly production plants in the southern 
hemisphere. These include aspects such as the use of recy-
cling-friendly materials, a lighting system equipped with pres-
ence detectors, and a stormwater retention basin. In 2012 this 
 already led to us winning the title of “Greenest Manufacturer” 
from the South African  Department of Economic Development, 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. 
The new press shop in Uitenhage meets the highest environmental 
 standards.
EMPloyEE IDEa cUts EnERGy consUMPtIon
Prompted by an employee suggestion, in 2013 the water tem-
perature of the washing plant in the paintshop at our Wolfsburg 
(Germany) site was reduced from 50 °C to room (or in this case, 
 production shop) temperature (21 °C). This simple modification 
 reduced the site’s CO2 load by 1,500 t. Washing is an essential step 
to remove grinding residues and contaminants caused by upstream 
operations from the body-in-white, because the painting process 
itself requires a perfectly clean surface.
 
ŠKODA. In July 2013 ŠKODA brought a new combined heat and 
power (CHP) plant on stream at its production plant in Kvasiny 
(Czech Republic). The CHP plant will cut annual CO2 emissions by 
10% or 8,000 t. Power and heat are generated by a gas engine, with 
the heat being used to warm up the water for the heating system.
Green It
The optimization of IT and telecommunications infrastructures 
and equipment offers great potential for improving resource and 
energy efficiency. One example here is the iDOMP global tender 
process for printers. This will gradually lead to a 32% improve-
ment in energy efficiency across the printer fleet as a whole, com-
pared to the printers replaced, resulting in annual energy savings 
of 2.18 GWh. At Audi the new data center which went live in 
 November 2012 in Ingolstadt (Germany) is boosting the energy 
 efficiency of the IT systems by one-third. An indirect outdoor cool-
ing system uses outside air to cool the servers at ambient tempera-
tures of up to 11 °C. 
 56
the Group already obtains around one 
third of its electricity from renewable 
sources.
 
Renewables Drive Production
Between now and 2020, the  Volkswagen Group is planning to in-
vest some €600 million in widening its use of renewable energy 
resources: hydropower, wind power, biomass and photovoltaics. 
Around one third of our global electricity consumption already 
comes from regenerative sources, and a number of pioneering 
projects based on renewables are already up and running.
The  Volkswagen Emden plant is a showcase example implement-
ing the “Think Blue. Factory.” concept with a unique combination 
of renewables. Alongside the world’s largest geothermal field, the 
site not only uses solar power, biomass, cogeneration and wind 
power, but is also one of the Group’s first production sites to 
use  innovative hydraulic energy storage. In January 2013 the 
 Volkswagen brand brought on stream what was at the time the 
world’s largest solar power plant. The  Volkswagen Chattanooga 
EnVIRonMEnt
106
Solar Park generates a peak output of 9.5 MW and it remains the 
largest solar power plant operated by an automaker in the USA. Its 
approximately 33,600 solar panels are expected to yield around 
13,100 MWh per annum, which would cover 13% of Chattanoo-
ga’s electricity requirements at full production capacity.
The Group also meets its targets by purchasing green electricity: 
since the beginning of 2013, 100% of the electricity purchased by 
 Volkswagen Slovakia has been from renewable sources, thereby 
reducing its indirect CO2 emissions by 22%. In September 2013, 
 Volkswagen de México signed an agreement with the power utility 
Mexico Power Group to purchase an annual average of 290,000 
MWh of green power. This will be generated by the La Bufa wind 
farm in Zacatecas state, scheduled to go on stream in September 
2014. This green electricity would cover around 60% of demand at 
the Puebla and Silao plants, and reduce the CO2 balance sheet by 
140,000 t each year.
The Polkowice (Poland) site converted to 100% hydro power back 
in 2011. Heat is supplied as district heating by an efficient gas and 
steam power plant. The remaining CO2 emissions are completely 
compensated by the reforestation of land directly adjacent to the 
Motor Polska factory, which entailed the planting of 59,820 trees 
in 6.82 hectares of forest in cooperation with the local forestry 
commission.
“SEAT al Sol”, currently the world’s largest photovoltaic plant in the 
automotive sector, came on stream in November 2013. The plant 
comprises 52,827 solar panels with a maximum rated output of 10.6 
MW, and covers an area of 276,000 m² on the roofs of six halls and 
four storage areas for finished vehicles. In its first year of operation, 
“SEAT al Sol” generated 17,629,086 kWh of energy at full capacity, 
exceeding its planned output by 18%. This in turn reduced CO2

focus on Water Management
As part of its mission to become the world’s most eco-friendly 
 manufacturer, the Group is aiming to reduce freshwater consump-
tion at all its brands by 25% by 2018 (base year: 2010). The high 
 volumes of cooling water used in automotive production offer scope 
for  reduction. Based on the comprehensive data collated in our 
Life  Cycle Assessments, we have undertaken a pioneering analysis 
of our water footprint, and identified the processes that consume 
the most water over the life cycle of representative  Volkswagen 
brand models. Unlike CO2, detailed analysis of the water footprint 
reveals that the use phase plays only a minor role. 96% of water 
 consumption is attributable to the production process, most of it 
upstream and a mere 10% in our own factories. Our scientific 
 paper on this topic won an award from the Environmental Science & 
Technology Journal during the reporting period. We are currently 
refining our techniques to enable them to be used on a larger scale 
in future. Throughout every aspect of our water management strat-
egy, we  remain mindful of the fact that water resource availability 
varies significantly from one region to the next, and solutions must 
be adapted accordingly. In the current reporting period, for the 
first time the  Volkswagen Group managed to compute the propor-
tion of water recovered and reused. Given the large number of sites 
and the complex production processes, this was just the first step in 
a systematic inventory. 45 sites have already submitted data, and 
 together they used 3.8 million cubic meters of recycled water, 
 corresponding to 8% of their combined freshwater uptake.

In October 2013, the  Volkswagen Group became one of the first 
automakers in the world to support the CEO Water Mandate,  a 
United Nations (UN) Global Compact platform to promote the 
sustainable use of water. Since 2011, we have also participated 
in the Water Disclosure Project (WDP), a non-profit organization 
which collates extensive data on companies’ annual water 
management. We were the only German automobile manufac-
turer to agree to publication of the results from day one. 
There is a limit to the extent that water use in production can be 
continuously reduced by technical means. So it is important to 
 reuse water as often as possible, or to operate a closed cycle. This 
principle is already in use at many of the Group’s sites worldwide. 
Our treatment plants employ innovative membrane or evaporator 
techniques, allowing the bulk of the process water to be reused. 
This way, more than 95% of the water remains in the cycle, or else 
is used for cooling, flushing toilets, and garden irrigation. As a 
 result, we are very close to achieving our vision of a virtually 
 wastewater-free factory at a number of sites. 
The Salzgitter (Germany) site treats all its industrial wastewater 
and recycles it completely. The recycled water is used, for example, 
in the production of emulsions. Thus, in the engine plant, an 
 evaporator system is used to extract most of the water from oily 
wastewater. Once separated, the condensate can be used in its 
 entirety to produce new emulsions and detergents. The remaining 
oil concentrate is either used as lubricating oil, or thermally recy-
cled in our own power plant. This has led to annual water savings 
of around 30,000 m³. At our Braunschweig (Germany) plant,  a 
conductance-controlled water spray metering system in the paint-
shop saves 34,380 m³ of water, reducing overall costs by around 
€232,000. 
At our Pune (India) plant, more than 99% of all biodegradable 
 materials are removed using state-of-the-art biological waste-
water treatment technologies such as a membrane bio-reactor, 
 allowing water to be reused on-site. Almost 100% of the waste-
water is returned to the cycle. In 2013,  Volkswagen India was 
awarded a Certificate of Appreciation by the Triveni Water Insti-
tute of the Confederation of Indian Industry. The Pune plant uses 
special taps which can reduce freshwater consumption by 75%; 
these have proven highly efficient. In Bratislava (Slovakia), in 
 collaboration with Comenius University, we have established a 
crayfish farm which is supplied with treated wastewater from the 
 Volkswagen plant. The farm provides optimum conditions for this 
endangered species. 
In 2012, Bentley succeeded in reducing water consumption at its 
Crewe (England) site by an impressive 36% year-on-year, thanks 
to extensive water treatment programs, and in October 2013 was 
the first automaker to be awarded the “Carbon Trust Water 
 Standard” certificate by the UK organization Carbon Trust in 
  recognition of this achievement.
Reducing solvent Emissions
Our paintshops use innovative waste air treatment techniques. 
New application techniques also reduce the use of rinsing aids. 
In Pamplona (Spain), for example, the  Volkswagen brand has 
reduced bonding agent waste to zero as part of the “Think Blue. 
Factory.” program. The plastic parts paintshop, which began op-
eration at the Wolfsburg plant in August 2013, has reduced en-
ergy consumption by up to 50% and emissions by an impressive 
90%. Every day, the 120 employees paint up to 4,000 bumpers 
and other plastic parts.

Waste Prevention and Recycling
A successful waste strategy is in force throughout all  Volkswagen 
plants, helping to reduce and prevent waste. At our Pamplona 
plant, as part of the “Think Blue. Factory.” program, for example, 
research is underway to analyze waste-producing processes and 
devise new procedures. Adhesive residues, paint sludge and waste-
water have already been successfully reduced. In this way, waste 
volumes at the site have been cut by more than 60% since 2010. 
We are one of only a handful of manufacturers to incorporate the 
supply of spare parts into our sustainability strategy. For example, 
the  Volkswagen brand’s sites in Kassel (Germany) and  Dalian 
(China) use a high-quality industrial process to remanufacture 
replacement parts such as engines and gearboxes, restoring 
them to as-new condition. Producing a remanufactured gearbox, 
for example, uses one third less primary energy than manufac-
turing a new one.
EnVIRonMEnt
108
Since the Genuine Remanufactured Parts Program was launched 
in 1947, some 7.9 million engines, 2.9 million gear boxes and 
more than 78 million other vehicle components have been given 
a new lease of life. The benefit for customers is that genuine 
 remanufactured parts are, on average, 40% cheaper than their 
new counterparts, yet offer the same quality, functionality and 
manufacturer’s warranty. As well as benefiting customers, this 
program is also good news for the environment: in the case of 
 engines, for example, up to 70% of materials are reusable. So 
 remanufacturing engines alone saves around 7,000 t of steel per 
annum.
new  Volkswagen vehicles contain 
around one third recycled material.
The  Volkswagen brand views recycling as an integral part of 
 vehicle development, with the outcome that 85% of each new 
 vehicle can be recycled and 95% recovered. New  Volkswagen 
 vehicles currently contain around one third recycled material. 
Take the Golf 7, for example: a certified calculation method 
computes the share of recycled material at between 34 and 35%. 
In order to ensure that this resource is still viable at the end of a 
lengthy service life, the brand is committed to the development of 
cutting-edge recycling technologies for end-of-life vehicles and 
their parts. Examples include the patented, multiple award- 
winning VW SiCon technique for processing shredder residues, 
and the LithoRec research project on the recycling of lithium-ion 
batteries from electric vehicles. 
 57
Wherever possible, the Group’s brands use renewable raw ma-
terials and recycled materials in their automobile production. 
For example,  Volkswagen do Brasil has collaborated with u niver-
sities and suppliers to develop a technique for processing natural 
curaua fibers for use in the production of door trim and parcel 
shelves. Recycled PET can also be used as a plastic in vehicle pro-
duction, for example in seat covers.

Since 1998,  Volkswagen Original Teile Logistik (OTLG) has been of-
fering a customized disposal program especially for car workshops. 
Nearly all workshops in the  Volkswagen,  Volkswagen Commercial 
Vehicles, Audi, SEAT and ŠKODA brands in Germany subscribe to this 
program. OTLG is designed to make life easier for dealerships and 
workshops, and ensure that all waste is professionally disposed of 
or recycled. Each year, some 50,000 t of waste is recovered from our 
partner workshops. Of this, around 4,000 t is liquids, 14,000 t pack-
aging, 14,000 used tires, 17,000 t vehicle parts and 1,000 t waste 
from paintshops.
optimizing logistics
Intermodal transport links at least two modes of transport (road, 
rail, ship) together. This approach is used to transport materials 
because suppliers do not always have their own rail link. In inter-
modal transport, a crane traditionally transships containers from 
a truck onto a train and vice versa. New transshipment technology 
eliminates the need for a crane, allowing freight operators to

switch flexibly between modes of transport, regardless of location. 
The CargoBeamer pilot project aims to relocate a large proportion 
of the 1,000 or so truckloads heading for the Wolfsburg site each 
day from the roads onto the rails, and thereby significantly reduce 
CO2 emissions from our logistical processes. In the reporting 
 period, the cooperation partners  Volkswagen AG and CargoBeam-
er AG received the 2013 elogistics award from AKJ Automotive for 
construction of the CargoBeamer terminal. Some shipments of 
material for series produc tion already use intermodal transport. 
Relocating from road to rail is expected to cut CO2 emissions by 
60% and energy consumption by 70%. 
Audi is continuously refining its logistics to save energy and mini-
mize CO2 emissions, and that includes the transport of finished 
vehicles. Wherever financially viable and technically feasible, 
Audi is committed to the use of rail freight. Across the Audi Group, 
more than 60% of vehicles leave the factories by rail. For selected 
models from the brand’s Ingolstadt plant, more than 70% are 
transported by rail, half of them on trains powered by renewable 
electricity. In 2010, Audi became the first company in Germany to 
sign up to the carbon-neutral “Eco Plus” rail freight service of-
fered by DB Schenker. For this product, the German rail operator 
Deutsche Bahn purchases additional green power for its domestic 
routes. Technical inspectorate TÜV SÜD has analyzed the CO2 
neutrality of Eco Plus and confirmed that 100% of the energy 
supplied is used for rail shipment of Audi vehicles and has no 
negative impact on the green power mix of other rail customers.

The  Volkswagen Group has become the first German automaker to 
join the Clean Shipping Network, an association of cargo owners. 
From now on, Corporate Logistics at  Volkswagen will use the Clean 
Shipping Index (CSI) to analyze and minimize the environmental im-
pacts of its ocean shipping. The CSI data makes it easier to compare 
the ecological efficiency of such shipments. Members of the Clean 
Shipping Network can use the index to trace the emissions of indi-
vidual vessels and specific routes, and thereby apply valid environ-
mental criteria when selecting a carrier. Apart from chemicals and 
waste disposal, this also includes emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx).
2008 saw the inauguration of SEAT Autometro, a rail link between 
the brand’s Martorell plant and the port of Barcelona (Spain). SEAT 
currently exports more than 40% of its vehicles by sea. At full capac-
ity, the train can transport more than 105,000 vehicles a year to 
Barcelona. In 2009, Autometro was joined by Cargometro, linking 
the Martorell plant to the factory in the free port zone (Zona Franca). 
Together, the two rail links take around 57,000 truck journeys off 
the road each year, eliminating 2,600 t of CO2 emissions.

conserving biological Diversity
Alongside climate change, the drastic loss of species, ecosystems 
and genetic diversity is one of the greatest challenges facing us 
 today. At  Volkswagen, protecting these natural assets is one of  
our declared aims – one that prompted us to become a founding 
member of the “Biodiversity in Good Company” initiative. 
 60
In 2008, the  Volkswagen Group  published 
a Mission statement  outlining its 
 commitment to  the conservation of 
biodiversity.
Biodiversity management is complex, and affects the entire value 
chain. Our factories offer the greatest scope for direct influence. 
When building or extending its production facilities, the Group 
gives preference to brownfield sites to help minimize land seal-
ing. Furthermore, since 2010 we have been analyzing the poten-
tial ecological risks at our sites and identifying adjacent land with 
a high biodiversity value. All production sites in Germany and 
 Europe in the immediate vicinity of protected areas have been 
identified (see Environmental Indicators, page 137). During 
2013, there were no known cases of  Volkswagen’s activities 
 endangering the natural habitats of species on the Red List of the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural 
 Resources (IUCN). 
collaboration for biodiversity
For over a decade, we have been in dialogue with the German 
 Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union NABU, and have 
 collaborated on joint nature conservation projects. In June 2013, 
we extended this partnership until 2015. Working closely with 
NABU, we are committed to using energy and resources more 
sparingly, and to protecting our moorlands. Because moorlands 
EnVIRonMEnt
110
store greenhouse gases, and are often home to endangered spe-
cies, moorland conservation is an excellent example of combining 
nature conservation with climate protection. 
NABU and  Volkswagen Leasing have been campaigning for 
 moorland protection in Germany since 2009.  Volkswagen Leas-
ing donated €1.6 million to help set up the German Moorland 
 Protection Fund, created in 2011. August 2013 saw the comple-
tion of a project in the “Weißer Graben” nature conservation 
area  in Lower Saxony (Germany). This was the first phase in a 
larger project for the  rewetting of dried-out areas in the Lower 
Saxony Lichtenmoor moorlands. 
Since 2006,  Volkswagen de México has been funding scientific 
 research into Mexico’s species diversity as well as a number of 
 specific conservation projects, under the motto “Por Amor al 
 Planeta” (For love of the planet). By 2013, €30,000 had been 
awarded to eight individual Mexican scientists in recognition of 
their  services to species conservation in Mexico and to support 
their ongoing work. Each year, the same amount is awarded to a 
nature conservation project, sometimes extending over several 
years. Three such projects have been funded in this way since 
2006, making  Volkswagen de México the most important private 
donor to biodiversity issues in Mexico.
afforestation and tree Planting
Forests are particularly important to biodiversity because of 
their function as CO2 sinks and habitats. In 2013,  Volkswagen 
supported NABU’s work to convert coniferous forest into 
 species-rich mixed woodland in the Biesenthal Basin near 
 Berlin. Ever since 2007, for every ŠKODA vehicle sold in the 
Czech Republic, the brand, assisted by its employees and their 
families, has planted a tree in the regions where it operates. In 
2013 that meant almost 60,000 seedlings, bringing the overall 
total to 423,000 trees planted in cooperation with more than 50 
local partners. Tree planting is also an opportunity to sensitize 
local employees to nature conservation issues. At the Kaluga 
factory of  Volkswagen Group Rus, employees took part in a mass 
maple planting in May 2013, having planted 100 lime trees in 
the factory grounds the year before. In October 2013, employ-
ees and their families planted 200 willows along the banks of 
the River Aller in Wolfsburg, while in Zwickau, the children of 
employees planted trees in a biotope adjacent to the factory 
premises. 
The Audi Environment Foundation, established in 2009, like-
wise focuses on nature conservation. Since January 2013, the 
Foundation has been supporting the Steigerwald Sustainability 
Center founded by the Bavarian government near Schweinfurt, 
Germany. Over the next five years, the Foundation has commit-
ted an initial sum of €100,000 to a number of its own projects. 
PRojEct aURocHs 
In 2002, Porsche in Leipzig launched a 65-hectare grazing project 
as a compensatory measure for its proving grounds. Safely fenced 
off from the off-road tracks, 20 wild horses and 75 aurochs serve 
as natural landscape protectors by helping to keep bushes and 
trees in check. The aim of this measure is to preserve the high na-
ture conservation value of the land with extensive mixed grazing. 
Monitoring concluded that the grazing project has met or even 
exceeded its nature conservation targets in terms of protecting 
the numbers of bird species nesting on the site.
VEHIclE oPERatIon 
Most CO2 emissions are generated during vehicle operation and 
not at the production and recycling stages of its life cycle. So the 
most effective way to reduce mobility-related CO2 emissions is to 
make vehicles more fuel-efficient. Our approach, however, goes 
even further. Because while the car will continue to play a key role 
in the mobility of the future, it will also be integrated more exten-
sively than ever with other modes of transport. 
Our philosophy of “intelligent mobility” combines meeting mobil-
ity needs with protection of the environment, and is based on 
achieving efficient synergies between people, infrastructures, 
technologies and the various modes of transport. In particular, 
the development of efficient vehicles and mobility-related services 
must be integrated into a diverse network of factors such as chang-
es in vehicle usage, social and demographic trends and infrastruc-
tural and eco-logical challenges. The  Volkswagen Group’s exten-
sive range of mobility-related services therefore also includes 
eco-friendly driver training programs, environmentally compati-
ble fleet management support, and car-sharing services.

In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), 
our 2012 Sustainability Report for the first time reported on the 
 Volkswagen Group’s non-energy indirect emissions (Scope 3 emis-
sions). A Scope 3 inventory comprises 15 different categories of 
emissions, including activities such as employee commuting, use of 
sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products and various 
categories of upstream emissions. The bulk of our CO2 emissions 
(approximately 76%) is accounted for by use of sold products (vehi-
cles). We can tackle these emissions not only by producing more fu-
elefficient vehicle models but also by offering new forms of vehicle 
use, fuel-economy training programs and information for custom-
ers. Emissions from upstream transportation and distribution, em-
ployee commuting and end-of-life treatment on the other hand 
make only a small contribution to total Scope 3 emissions, at well 
below 5%. Nevertheless, here too the cataloging of emissions has 
sharpened our focus on key action areas, given that we are aiming 
to set a good example in all areas, and to exploit all options open to 
us (figures: see page 133).

carsharing Programs
In November 2011,  Volkswagen Financial Services launched the 
“Quicar – Share a  Volkswagen” carsharing project in Hanover. In 
the meantime the number of pick-up points in the city – specially 
designated parking places and car parks – where a fleet of 170 
 Volkswagen-brand vehicles are available for short or longer-term 
rental has increased to almost 100. Quicar provides high avail-
ability, with efficient vehicles and an attractive and flexible 
charging system. It is also easy and convenient to use. The Quicar 
fleet comprises mainly Golf BlueMotion• models equipped with 
a 1.6-l TDI engine, offering average fuel consumption of just 
3.8 l/100 km and emissions of only 99 g CO2/km. In late 2013, 
 Quicar had 10,119 registered customers. The average duration of 
a rental was 2.8 hours. In September 2012, Quicar came out “best 
in test”, with an overall score of 1.8, when German consumer 
 institute Stiftung Warentest compared nine carsharing providers 
from Germany and the Netherlands. Booking, driving and online 
experience were among the categories where Quicar impressed 
the reviewers. 
 62
Quicar scored a best-in-test 1.8

Stiftung Warentest.
In April 2013, through its joint venture with Pon Holdings, 
 Volkswagen Financial Services acquired a stake in Collect Car 
(Greenwheels) – the Dutch car-sharing market leader, whose 
 European fleet comprises approximately 2,000 vehicles. The aim 
is to jointly develop the Greenwheels business model and to bring 
it to other European markets as well. With this investment 
 Volkswagen Financial Services has taken the next step in its bid to 
become the world’s leading automotive financial services provider 
by 2018. In a market in which new mobility products will take up 
their place alongside the traditional vehicle ownership model, the 
 Volkswagen Financial Services AG subsidiaries are now catering 
to an even greater range of customer mobility requirements, with 
everything from leasing, long-term rental and car hire to carshar-
ing products. 
 63
“Audi mobility” is developing innovative, premium-oriented 
mobility services with an international focus, with market 
launch scheduled for 2014. Sustainability will be a hallmark 
of these services, for example through use of Audi e-tron• und 
Audi g-tron•  vehicles and intelligent carsharing concepts.
solutions for Urban Mobility
By the year 2050, the United Nations predicts that the world’s 
 population will have grown to more than 9.5 billion people. It 
 estimates that the global urban population will double, with more 
than two thirds of people living in cities. This will place increasing 
strain on urban mobility systems throughout the world. All urban 
stakeholders will therefore need to make more effective use of 
 limited urban space. 
The Mobility Research function at the  Volkswagen Group has 
 already systematically analyzed the strategic challenge of urban 
space shortage and developed technically feasible solutions capa-
ble of making a significant contribution to improved urban trans-
port by 2030. These solutions have been showcased by  Volkswagen 
in a film which depicts typical mobility situations for different 
types of urban user in the year 2030. The solutions presented 
range from new types of vehicle, new ways of driving and new 
forms of vehicle use through to multimodal transport solutions 
and the design of integrated urban transport hubs. The film 
demonstrates the broad-based approach being taken by 
 Volkswagen and will also be used in communication with the 
 general public.

In the study “What Cities Want”, published in May 2013, scientists 
from the Technical University of Munich were commissioned by 
MAN to investigate how 15 major cities – from Ahmedabad (India) 
and Los Angeles (USA) to Singapore – are preparing for the expected 
increase in their populations and how this will affect their urban 
 development and traffic planning policies. One thing all these cities 
have in common is that they are giving top priority to expanding 
 local public transport, by adding more routes, by providing more 
frequent services and by offering better customer service. 
 65
In 2010, Audi launched the Audi Urban Future Initiative, a think-
tank that brings together creative thinkers from many different dis-
ciplines to analyze urban mobility issues. International architects, 
urban planners, sociologists and futurologists are all working with 
Audi to develop integrated urban mobility solutions. The Initiative 
includes an international award – the Audi Urban Future Award – 
which is presented every two years for particularly outstanding 
 urban mobility visions. Audi is also working with leading universi-
ties to explore future urban mobility scenarios. For example it is 
working with Columbia University on the “Extreme Cities Project”, 
whose theme is megacities in the year 2050. Regular workshops 
with experts from a variety of disciplines, and the work of an inter-
departmental think-tank – the Audi Insight Team – are also part of 
this initiative. 
 66
The  Volkswagen Group is a partner in the “Morgenstadt – City 
 Insights” innovation network, whose aim is to explore the best 
technologies and solutions for a sustainable redesign of the cities 
of tomorrow. The network is a neutral platform providing infor-
mation about current aspects of the research and development  
of  sustainable cities. As a long-standing member of the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), we are 
also  working with other member companies on the “Sustainable 
 Mobility 2.0” project, which was launched in 2013. The aim is to 
develop competent and professional solutions for the sustainable 
urban mobility of the future, which will be discussed with selected 
 cities from around the world.
Reducing traffic noise
Urban traffic often comes with a variety of human costs. As an 
 issue which can sometimes significantly reduce the quality of 
life in cities, traffic noise is an increasingly important concern. 
How best to provide personal mobility while at the same time 
 reducing its noise impact is a task for all stakeholders, in which the 
 Volkswagen Group too is playing its part.
As an automaker, the  Volkswagen brand is working intensively to 
further reduce noise at the level of the individual vehicle. Work on 
noise reduction at the  Volkswagen Acoustics Center in Wolfsburg 
is focused on continuous optimization of all aspects of the power-
train, along with aerodynamic aspects and tire/road noise. For all 
vehicles of the Group, noise is a particularly important consider-
ation when selecting original equipment tires. 
To address the issue of traffic noise, the  Volkswagen Group also 
goes a step further. In cooperation with Hamburger Lärmkontor 
GmbH (Germany), a noise level tool has been developed that 
 evaluates noise reduction measures using noise modeling and 
mapping, and assesses the impact of such measures in terms of the 
numbers of people exposed to noise.
As demonstrated by the development of the noise level tool, which 
measures noise “immissions”, i.e. exposure, we are placing an 
 important focus on how people are actually affected by noise. This 
is also illustrated by our ongoing dialogue with representatives of 
 local authorities, that is to say those who work with these issues on 
a practical, day-to-day basis. A good example of this is our collabo-
ration with the City of Wolfsburg, where noise reduction measures 
in 2013 included paving a city-center street with low-noise asphalt, 
which has substantially reduced noise levels for local residents. 
The overall aim of the Group’s activities in the field of traffic noise 
is to gain a better understanding of the contribution of the car  
to traffic noise, as an objective yardstick for deciding which tasks 
should in future be the responsibility of automakers, like our-
selves, and which tasks require a more broadly focused approach, 
involving dialogue with other stakeholders. 
fuel-saver training helps drivers  
cut consumption by as much as 25%.
More fuel-Efficient Driving
For many years the  Volkswagen brand and the German Nature and 
Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) have been organizing 
free-of-charge fuel-saver training courses throughout Germany 
under the motto “drive smart – save fuel”. The training is provided 
by local NABU teams,  Volkswagen dealerships and a professional 
team of “ Volkswagen driving experience” instructors. The course 
participants drive an identical route on public roads twice, once 
using their normal driving style and once with instructor guid-
ance. Data from the two trips is interpreted and compared by a 
 special on-board trip analyzer. Finally, at the end of the course, 
the participants are given a brochure with fuel-saver tips to take 
away with them. These courses enable drivers to take responsibil-
ity at the personal level for greener mobility. Drivers who have 
mastered the basic principles of a smart driving style can cut their 
fuel consumption by up to 25%, thereby reducing their carbon 
footprint and at the same time saving themselves money. Empiri-
cal monitoring of the training has shown that drivers are able  
to reduce their fuel consumption by an average of 13%. A fuel- 
efficient driving style also contributes to reductions in air pollu-
tion and noise emissions and makes for greater road safety.  
The  Volkswagen brand supports the fuel-saver training courses  
by supplying vehicles and instructors free of charge. In 2013, 
 approximately 300 drivers took part in these courses throughout 
Germany.

fleet Management
Fleet customers of  Volkswagen Leasing who lease an eco- 
friendly  Volkswagen Group vehicle with CO2 emissions of less 
than 130 g/km automatically participate in the “Environmental 
Program for Sustainable Fleet Management”, organized by 
 Volkswagen Leasing and the German Nature and Biodiversity 
Conservation Union (NABU). For each model leased,  Volkswagen 
Leasing and the relevant Group brand make a donation to NABU, 
which the organization channels into conservation and climate 
projects. Since this cooperation began, the population of partic-
ularly eco-friendly cars in the  Volkswagen Leasing portfolio 
has risen to 283,859 vehicles (per December 2013). Moreover, 
the past 4.5 years brought a 14% reduction in the average 
CO2 emissions of all vehicle deliveries to  Volkswagen Leasing’s 
 major  customers. 
Further ways in which  Volkswagen Leasing can help its custom-
ers make their fleet management operations more eco-friendly 
include advising them on a green company car policy which as 
well as covering eligibility also defines user groups and bench-
mark vehicles, specification levels, model configuration options 
and vehicle make.
The Environmental Program also includes ECO driver training, 
where participants learn how to save fuel and costs by changing 
their driving style. A brochure with eco-friendly driving tips is 
also available online. Following the successful introduction of 
this program in Germany,  Volkswagen Financial Services plans 
to roll it out in other markets as well.

“GREEn flEEt” aWaRD 
In 2010,  Volkswagen Financial Services and NABU created the annu-
al “Green Fleet Award” for fleet customers. The awards for ecologi-
cally responsible fleet management are presented in three catego-
ries:
 > “Highest proportion of eco-friendly  Volkswagen Group vehicles”
 > “Highest proportion of alternative  Volkswagen Group powertrain 
technologies” and
 > “Fleet with the lowest average CO2 emissions”.
89 fleet customers competed for the 2013 awards, which were pre-
sented at the IAA Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2013. Awards 
went to companies whose fleets (comprising at least ten vehicles 
from  Volkswagen Group brands) made a significant contribution to 
reduced CO2 emissions by the use of state-of-the-art vehicle tech-
nologies and innovative fleet solutions.
traffic and transport Initiatives at the Plants
As part of our CO2 emissions monitoring, we also monitor emis-
sions from employee commuting. We disclose these emissions in 
our Scope 3 inventory (see page 133), while at the same time work-
ing on initiatives to reduce them. For example at the Wolfsburg 
site, the  Volkswagen brand teamed up with the City of Wolfsburg, 
Wolfsburg AG and Autostadt in the “Transport Task Force”, whose 
aim is to improve traffic flow in the vicinity of the site. Since Febru-
ary 2012, representatives of the different departments and exter-
nal partners have been meeting on an ongoing basis to identify 
and initiate appropriate traffic measures. Again the focus is not 
just on the car alone but on an intelligent mix of different transport 
modes. A variety of measures have been successfully implemented 
in the meantime. For example on public transport routes serving 
the plant additional buses have been laid on and timetables have 
been extended; an exit and entry lane on the A 39 motorway was 
widened; and several thousand parking spaces were created 
around the Wolfsburg plant. At the same time employees are being 
offered a special bus and rail pass for travel on services of the

As in previous years, in 2013 the  Volkswagen brand again support-
ed the Germany-wide “Stadtradeln” cycling campaign organized 
by the Klima-Bündnis alliance for climate protection, while in 
the USA,  Volkswagen of America continued its sponsoring of the 
 People for Bikes cycling lobby. Support for cycling is also the key 
pillar in the international sponsorship strategy of ŠKODA, which 
started out as a cycle manufacturer in 1895.
Individual sites and brands of the  Volkswagen Group encourage 
their employees to use bikes for short trips. In Uitenhage (South 
Africa) office workers too can now often be seen using bikes rather 
than their company cars to get around the site. And in the UK, 
Bentley’s “Green Travel” program includes a bike-to-work scheme. 
Approximately 10% of the Bentley plant’s workforce commute by 
bike, far higher than the average for the United Kingdom.

Ongoing measurement and evaluation of our sustainability performance is critical to 
achieving our goals. The Volkswagen Group’s sustainability indicators document 
progress in all three dimensions: economy, people and environment. For the second 
time we also include indirect CO2 emissions in our reporting in line with Scope 3 of 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Working together for the community
­Volkswagen­­
Community­trust
For the  Volkswagen Group it is a fundamental conviction that everything we 
do should also create value for society as a whole. This belief drives us, together  
with our employees, to initiate and support social projects across all the 
 continents of the world. The work of the  Volkswagen Community Trust in South 
Africa shows how both sides benefit. 
The  Volkswagen plant in Uitenhage (South Africa) was built during the apartheid era. Today some 4,500 employees work here, build-
ing the Polo, Polo Vivo and Polo Stufe models as well as Vivo engines. The  Volkswagen Group’s presence in South Africa also  includes 
the MAN plants at Pinetown and Olifantsfontein, producing trucks and bus chassis as well as city and intercity buses.

Focus on South Africa
High unemployment, extreme poverty, the constant threat of 
violence: for many in Kabah, a majority-black township in the 
KwaLanga district of Uitenhage, South Africa, life is all about 
doing without. For young people growing up here the concept of 
a carefree childhood is a distant dream. And with a lack of 
 suitable teaching resources and qualified staff, state schools 
cannot create a stimulating learning environment either. 
So for this neighborhood the Ikhwezi Lomso Early Childhood 
Center is much more than a little “morning star” – which is 
what “Ikhwezi Lomso” means. This center, built in 2011 with 
funding from the  Volkswagen Community Trust and donations 
from the  Volkswagen workforce in South Africa, is making good 
education possible, opening up prospects for a brighter future 
ahead. 
Around 100 five- and six-year-old children are prepared for 
starting school here by qualified teachers. Age-appropriate 
learning materials are used to develop memory and cognition 
skills. A soup kitchen provides for their physical welfare, and 
specialists are regularly on hand to provide psychological and 
medical support. The center also stays open after school hours 
for younger children from the district to attend the regular 
reading club. “Our goal is to stimulate the children’s curiosity 
and develop their sensory perception skills”, explains Vernon 
Naidoo, Manager of the  Volkswagen Community Trust in Uiten-
hage, adding that: “We want to boost their emotional intelli-
gence and their self-belief, so that they’re really well prepared 
for starting school.” 
education is the solution for many of South Africa’s social 
problems and the key to building the country’s economic pros-
perity. The earlier this education starts the more lasting its 
 effect. Which is why supporting education – especially for pre-
schoolers – is a priority for the  Volkswagen Community Trust 
(VWCT). This charitable foundation spent around 80% of its 
total funding budget of ZAR 5 million (around €360,000) on 
 education in 2012. Just keeping the Ikhwezi Lomso center run-
ning for a year accounted for nearly ZAR 1 million. Yet simply 
providing the building was not enough to guarantee a positive 
impact on the development of the wider community. “We want 
to establish proper management structures to safeguard the 
 future of our center”, explains Naidoo. He is working closely 
with the local authorities to achieve this end.
The  Volkswagen Community Trust – which was also founded 
back in the apartheid era, in the face of significant opposition 
– has initiated and carried out more than 300 projects to date. 
The guiding principle in all cases is helping people to help 
themselves. The workforce and management of the  Volkswagen 
plant in Uitenhage, along with representatives of the unions 
and the authorities in nearby communities, work together to 
decide which projects will be supported. The key factor here is 
whether the proposed project will help the community as a 
whole. This process leads to cooperation with different types of 
organization – authorities, schools, churches and NGOs.
 
Working together for the community is an integral component 
of the  Volkswagen culture – in South Africa as in other locations 
worldwide. The desire to give something back to society has 
been taken on board by employees across the Group – as is 
clearly evidenced by the enduring success of international 
workforce-led initiatives. One example is “A Chance to Play”, 
the campaign launched in 2008 in the run-up to the football 
World Cup in South Africa. Sports facilities and regular training 
sessions were provided in conjunction with the charity “terre des 
hommes”– reaching out to more than 50,000 children. Now this 
campaign, renamed “A Chance to Play – O direito de brincar”, 
has been carried over to the next World Cup in Brazil. A total   
of 14 projects have been launched – among them a crèche and 
anti-violence training in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
80% of the  Volkswagen Community 
Trust’s funding budget is invested  
in educational projects for children 
and adolescents.
Yet this social commitment also takes the form of active 
participation in social and ecological projects – volunteering is 
a core element of the  Volkswagen Group ethos. A survey con-
ducted in 2010 in the provinces of Eastern Cape and Gauteng 
showed that 83% of  Volkswagen South Africa employees were 
“not afraid to get their hands dirty” in community service work. 
This strong desire to get involved led to the creation of the em-
ployee volunteering program “Great Show of Hands”. Founded 
in 2011, this initiative is today an established long-term volun-
teer program. To date over 1,000 employees have been involved in 
the redecoration, maintenance or renovation of primary schools, 
a children’s hospital, a home for the disabled and many other 
 facilities belonging to non-profit organizations.
A prime example here is the work undertaken by  Volkswagen 
employees in South Africa on behalf of Nonkqubela Pre-Primary 
School in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. As part of “Great Show of 
Hands”, this team of volunteers laid 1,000 m2 of lawn, planted 
70 trees, created a playground and installed water tanks – all 
in the space of a few hours. All the necessary materials were 
provided by the Community Trust. “Many of our employees are 
also keen to get involved as trainers for sports activities”, says 
trust manager Naidoo. No doubt their enthusiasm is further 
boosted by the public recognition accorded to the engagement 
of   Volkswagen employees. In its 2013 “Drivers of Change” 
 competition, the Southern Africa Trust named “Great Show of 
Hands” among the finalists in the Corporate Volunteering 
 category.

our ApproACH
The principles of sustainability management in the  Volkswagen 
Group are described in the Strategy chapter of this report (see page 
18), along with our goals and actions in pursuit of continuous im-
provement. Further details on the goals and actions can be found 
at the end of this chapter (see page 139). In recent years we have 
focused on establishing uniform standards and procedures at all 
Group brands. This process is not quite complete. An overview of 
the principles, agreements and procedures that apply across the 
Group is provided by the table on page 123. These lay the founda-
tions for a common Group-wide understanding of sustainability 
and for measuring, managing and improving our sustainability 
performance.
management by Key indicators
In order to manage its sustainability performance, the  Volkswagen 
Group records central performance indicators in line with the re-
quirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the ESG 
(Environment, Social, Governance) indicator framework of the 
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS). We 
know that our shareholders and investors are increasingly also 
asking about our ESG performance, which is why we are providing 
the following overview of our economic, environmental and social 
performance in quantitative terms.
measurement of scope 3 emissions 
in line with the Greenhouse Gas 
 Protocol continued.
Changes to methodology and measurement methods
The indicators presented are a continuation of those from previous 
years. There have been no changes in reporting and measurement 
methods. The Group has, however, grown by a further six produc-
tion facilities over the past year and consequently seen the work-
force grow by over 20,000 employees. We state which units each of 
the individual indicators relates to and will in the coming years 
endeavor to include all sites and companies. As for measurement 
methods, our last report was the first time emissions had been 
 reported according to Scope 3 of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pro-
tocol, something we have continued in this report. This puts us 
ahead of the field in our sector.
frame of reference
The indicators invariably relate to the entire Group and include 
companies in which our equity interest exceeds 50%. For our joint 
ventures in China, we report HR (social) indicators “at equity”,  
in other words 50%, but include 100% of the environmentally  
relevant data. However, due to differing definitions or recording 
methods, it is not yet possible in all areas to consolidate data 
 reported by the brands and regions, which means that there are 
still numerous exceptions. We point these exceptions out and indi-
cate precisely which units the data relate to. In the coming years, 
we will endeavor to provide uniform data collection for all sites and 
companies.

Transparency with regard to environmental and social performance and sustainable 
 governance is fundamental to any form of management, and society expects as much from 
 companies. With its Strategy 2018 the  Volkswagen Group is pursuing clear goals. Ongoing 
 measurement and evaluation is critical to achieving these goals.

Auditing and standards
The  Volkswagen Group Sustainability Report 2013 has been 
 audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsge-
sellschaft (PwC) taking account of the Stakeholder Engagement 
Standard AccountAbility 1000 (AA1000AS) 2008 and with 
 complementary consideration of the International Standard  
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. In the course of their 
assurance engagement, PwC carried out the following activi-
ties: interviews with management; interviews with employees  
responsible for reporting sustainability information; recording 
the processes used to acquire, calculate and report sustainabili-
ty information. The quantitative data for the 2013 reporting year 
that were audited by PwC are marked in the Indicators chapter 
with the following symbol: 
Further information can be found in the Independent Assurance 
Report on page 150. 
further reporting within the Group
More detailed insight into our environmental management is 
 provided by the Environmental Statements which numerous  sites 
compile as part of their voluntary participation in the European 
EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) system. 
The sustainability reports of the Audi, MAN, Scania and ŠKODA 
brands are also indicative of the Group’s commitment to sustain-
ability. This year Porsche will also issue a sustainability report in 
line with GRI standards.

As at December 31, 2013 the  Volkswagen Group, including the 
Chinese joint ventures, had 572,800 employees, 4.2% more 
than at the end of the 2012 financial year. Major factors in this 
rise were new hirings in growth markets, in particular in China, 
and the employment of specialists and experts, not least in 
 Germany. The distribution of Group employees between Germany 
and outside Germany remained unchanged over the past year: as 
at the end of 2012, 45.4% of employees worked in Germany on 
the balance-sheet date.

One of the Company’s goals is to continue to increase the pro-
portion of women from 15.5% across the Group, especially in 
 management. 
In the reporting year, the proportion of women in management 
roles in the  Volkswagen Group in Germany was increased to 7.9% 
among senior management and 11.2% in management (at year 
end, excl. Scania, MAN and Porsche), while among top manage-
ment, the proportion fell from 5.5% in 2012 to 4.8% in the re-
porting year (at year end, excl. Scania, MAN and Porsche).
Due to its targeted recruitment measures, the  Volkswagen Group 
employs a large proportion of well qualified employees. Some 97% 
of employees hold some form of qualification.

Low absenteeism calls for increased availability of diagnostic 
and screening measures. Absenteeism is calculated using the 
formula: number of days lost due to illness or accident multi-
plied by 100, divided by total possible days’ attendance in the 
relevant period.
Since 2009, the average age at  Volkswagen AG has been relatively 
constant, which is a sign of a healthy balance between recruitment 
of employees on completion of their vocational education and 
training and retirement of long-serving employees.
The employee turnover rate indicates the percentage of employees 
that leave the company in the course of a year. As the graph shows, 
there is a very high level of stability in  Volkswagen’s workforce.

The accident frequency index is an indication of the frequency 
with which accidents at work occurred in relation to the total 
number of hours worked. The formula for calculating the index 
is: number of occupational accidents, multiplied by 1 million, 
 divided by the number of hours worked.
The accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents are 
by relating the total number of working days lost to the number of 
hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is: number of 
working days lost, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number 
of hours worked multiplied by ten.
The number of occupational accidents has risen slightly. The 
 accident frequency index has remained at the preceding year’s 
low level. The severity of accidents in the Volkswagen Group has 
risen slightly for the first time since 2006. This is primarily 
 attributable to the integration of new sites and companies. Since 
then, only one Volkswagen AG employee has died, in 2011, as 
the result of an  occupational accident.
The greatest improvements in terms of accident frequency were 
achieved at Volkswagen Osnabrück, Audi Brussels, Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles in Hanover, Volkswagen Sachsen Chemnitz, 
Volkswagen AG Braunschweig and at Volkswagen Group Rus’s 
Kaluga plant.

This chapter presents selected environmental data for the 
 Volkswagen Group in aggregated form. The data are collected, 
checked and approved at the production sites in line with an inter-
nal standard (VW standard 98 000). In order to improve the accu-
racy and consistency of the resultant information, the recording of 
environmentally relevant consumption and emission data is sub-
ject to a continuous improvement process. This applies in particu-
lar to those items of information which have to be recorded with 
the assistance of specific calculation algorithms. Moreover, the 
integration of new Group brands and sites into environmental 
data recording calls for adjustments to past data already reported. 
For instance, the values for December of the preceding year may 
include some estimated data, for example if they are based on bills 
from power suppliers or waste disposal providers which were not 
yet available at the time of compilation. In the next data collection 
round, these estimated data are then replaced with the values for 
December which have become available in the meantime.
All in all, environmental data were collected from production sites 
with a workforce of around 467,000 (as at December 31, 2013). 
The 2013 figures include for the first time Ducati Motor Holding 
S.p.A. as a further brand, the Chinese production sites  Volkswagen 
FAW Engine Co. Ltd. in Changchun and  Volkswagen FAW Platform 
Company Ltd. in Chengdu and the new Silao plant in Mexico. 
 Production at the Foshan, Ningbo and Urumqi plants in China 
only started in late 2013 and these plants are not yet included in 
environmental data recording.
The data in the “car and light commercial vehicle” category for 
the years 2010, 2012 and 2013 are recorded as in the  Volkswagen 
Annual Report. The data for the brands Scania AB, MAN SE, 
 Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. and VW Kraftwerk GmbH are report-
ed in the “Other divisions” category. The respective proportions 
are indicated separately in the graphs. Unless indicated other-
wise, both categories include all Group production sites and the 
power stations and boiler plants operated by  Volkswagen AG at 
the Wolfsburg, Kassel and Hanover sites in Germany. 
The  Volkswagen Group is essentially an automobile manufacturer 
that produces cars and light commercial vehicles as well as 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles and buses. However, the addition 
of MAN SE has meant that marine engines and power station com-
ponents are now also part of the product portfolio. The entirety of 
the environmental impact thus cannot simply be related to the 
number of  vehicles produced. Relative key indicators are therefore 
recorded only for the “car and light commercial vehicle” catego-
ry. The number of vehicles produced in 2013 totaled 9,503,783 
cars and light commercial vehicles and 224,065 heavy-duty com-
mercial vehicles.
Increased consumption of electricity and heat and of fuel gases for 
manufacturing processes is associated with the continuous in-
crease in production over the reporting period. Consumption of 
space heat and industrial heat is subject to variation due to climat-
ic and manufacturing conditions.

Despite increased production volumes and the inclusion of new 
production sites, with a consequent increase in energy con-
sumption, direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) have been falling 
since 2010. Resource-optimized manufacturing processes and 
efficient power generation plants have played a part in this.
Increased consumption of electrical energy, heat and fuel gases 
led to a rise in total – direct and indirect – CO2 emissions. However, 
the increase was restricted by the growing use of energy from 
 renewable resources. Over the full reporting period, CO2 emis-
sions per vehicle manufactured were reduced.
definitions: sCope 1, 2 And 3
Scope 1: Greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents from sources 
directly attributable to the Company (also known as direct emis-
sions): primary energy consumption by Company-owned plant and 
equipment for manufacturing and energy generation, fuel con-
sumption by Company-owned vehicles, as well as other possible 
sources such as own landfills and wastewater treatment plants.
Scope 2: Greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents created 
during the generation of purchased energy (electricity, heat or 
steam).
Scope 3: Greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents from sources 
not directly belonging to but closely associated with the Company, 
such as employee commuting, emissions generated during the use 
phase of products or upstream, for instance during the extraction 
of raw materials or transport-related activities.

Goals and actions 
In line with the Scope 3 standard published by the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources 
 Institute in 2011,  Volkswagen is reporting CO2 emissions for 
twelve out of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories. The calculations have 
revealed that the “purchased goods and services” and “use phase” 
emission categories account for more than 93% of all Scope 3 
emissions. Calculation of the CO2 emissions for the use phase is 
based on a Group fleet value representing the global vehicle 
 population in the four major regions (EU28, USA, Brazil,  China). 
In view of the relevance of the two above-named categories, the 
relevant data were the subject of separate audits by external 
 auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers in compliance with audit 
standard ISAE 3000 “International Standard on Assurance 
 Engagements”.

Increased vehicle production is also associated with higher 
paint consumption, leading to an increase in VOC emissions in 
absolute terms. Modern coating processes did, however, assist 
in reducing specific emissions per vehicle produced.

Goals and actions 
The volume of metallic “waste”, which in the light of its high 
 recycling rate can be considered to be a valuable material, has 
increased in absolute terms over the reporting period as a 
whole due to increased production across the  Volkswagen Group 
and the introduction of new models. In specific terms, however, 
the volume of this kind of waste per vehicle has fallen due to 
 improved material utilization and resource-optimized manu-
facturing processes. 
The recycling rate for non-hazardous and hazardous waste has 
undergone continuous improvement to around 70% over the 
 reporting period. This also had a positive impact on the volume of 
waste for disposal per vehicle.

Due to increased production across the Group, there was a rise 
in the wastewater parameter chemical oxygen demand, both in 
absolute terms and per vehicle produced. A distinction is drawn 
between sites which, as indirect dischargers, discharge waste-
water into municipal sewers for further purification, and those 
sites which, as direct dischargers, operate an in-house waste-
water treatment plant and discharge the purified wastewater 
 directly into a body of water. In the reporting year 2013, indirect-
ly discharging sites accounted for 92% (2010: 91%; 2012: 90%) 
of the Group’s total wastewater volumes (excluding MAN and 
 Scania).

The present Sustainability Report takes full account of the third edition of the reporting 
 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 3.0). In what follows we show how the individual 
indicators are implemented and the degree to which they are reported. At the same time we set 
out how we implement the requirements of the United Nations Global Compact (UN GC) and of the 
German Sustainability Code (GSC). A full overview of the GRI Index including the supplementary 
indicators is available on the microsite.

To Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg
We have been engaged by Volkwagen Aktiengesellschaft, to perform 
an independent assurance engagement to attain moderate assurance1 
in respect of observing the AA1000 AccountAbility principles and of 
selected sustainability information set out in the Sustainability Report 
of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, (the “Company”) for the business year 
from 1st January to 31st December 2013 (the “Sustainability Report”). 
Our independent assurance engagement refers to qualitative infor-
mation set out in the printed version of the Sustainability Report and 
on selected quantitative sustainability information. The quantitative 
sustainability information selected by the Company and evaluated by 
us is marked separately with the symbols
 and
 . 
management’s responsibility 
Company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the com-
pliance of the sustainability management with the principles of inclu-
sivity, materiality and responsiveness as defines in the AccountAbility 
Principles Standard (2008) and the preparation of the Sustainability 
Report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability 
 Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pages 7 to 17) of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI):
 >  Materiality,
 > Stakeholder Inclusiveness,
 > Sustainability Context,
 > Completeness,
 > Balance,
 > Clarity,
 > Accuracy,
 > Timeliness,
 > Comparability and
 > Reliability.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appro-
priate methods to prepare the sustainability report and the use of as-
sumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures 
which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the re-
sponsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining sys-
tems and processes relevant for the preparation of the sustainability 
report and for ensuring compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility 
principles. 
responsibility of the auditor 
Our responsibility is to form an opinion, based on our assurance pro-
cedures, on whether facts have come to our attention which would lead 
us to assume that in all material respects
 > the systems and processes installed by the Company are not appro-
priate for compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles; or
 > qualitative sustainability information set out in the Sustainability 
Report has not been prepared in compliance with the criteria set out 
in den Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pages 7 to 17) 
der Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); or
 > the selected quantitative sustainability information marked with a 
symbol and set out in the Sustainability Report has not been pre-
pared in compliance with the criteria set out in den Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pages 7 to 17) of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI).
Within the scope of our independent assurance engagement we did 
not perform any evidence-gathering procedures on quantitative 
 sustainability information that were not marked with the symbols
 
and
 separately.
We also have been engaged to provide recommendations concerning 
the further development of sustainability management and sustain-
ability reporting based on the results of our independent assurance 
engagement. 
We conducted our independent assurance engagement in accordance 
with AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS) 2008 and also in ac-
cordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000. These standards require that we comply with ethical 
 requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement, 
 under consideration of materiality, to provide our conclusion with 
moderate assurance1, which is the degree of assurance that was re-
quired by the Company. We are independent as defined by Section 3.2 
of AA1000AS (2008). Due to our expertise and experience with the 
evaluation of non-financial information, sustainability management 
as well as social and ecological issues, we have the competencies 
 required to conduct this independent assurance engagement.
An independent assurance engagement performed to obtain moderate 
assurance1 is less substantial in scope than an independent assurance 
engagement performed to obtain high assurance2, with the result that 
a corresponding lower level of assurance is obtained. The audit activi-
ties to be performed are selected by the auditor after a due assessment 
of the circumstances. 
We conducted our evidence-gathering procedures at the level of the 
headquarters located in Wolfsburg as well as on the level of selected 
companies:
 > Audi AG, Ingolstadt, Germany 
 > Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart, Germany 
 > Scania AB, Södertälje, Sweden 
 > Volkswagen Financial Services AG, Braunschweig, Germany 
 > Shanghai-Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd., Shanghai, China
With regard to compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility Princi-
ples, our examination procedures included the following:
 > Interview with relevant contact persons of the competences 
„Stakeholder Engagement & Stakeholder Dialogue” and “Corpo-
rate  Responsibility”;
 > Collecting and evaluating the relevant documentation for the stake-
holder dialogues, additional communication with stakeholders and 
participatory formats at the level of headquarters and at the level of 
selected national companies;
 > Obtaining an understanding of the relevant documentation for the 
identification and prioritization of sustainability issues and CR 
fields of action and identified stakeholder expectations at the level of 
headquarters and at the level of selected national companies.
1  “Moderate assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “limited 
 assurance” as specified by ISAE 3000.
2  “High assurance” as specified by AA1000AS (2008) is equivalent to “reasonable 
 assurance” as specified by ISAE 3000.

material findings and judgments 
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
inclusivity: The identification, integration and the active exchange 
with internal and external stakeholders is carried out by the Company. 
The involvement of management in the results of the stakeholder man-
agement is established. The Company has identified and prioritized 
their relevant stakeholders. The national stakeholders of the interna-
tional national affiliates are not yet fully involved in stakeholder man-
agement. Formal requirements for stakeholder management are not 
yet companywide consistently defined. 
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
materiality: Prior to the sustainability reporting the Company used 
the extensive external stakeholder discussions of single brands to 
identify the main sustainability issues of the Group. The identification 
of the materiality of the issues is based on appropriate criteria and is 
established. The rated issues are prioritized in the Sustainability 
 Report of the Company and according to their belonging shown in the 
identified fields of actions.
Findings with regard to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principle of 
responsiveness: The Company has established a coordinated and 
quality assured process for responding to stakeholder requests. The 
Company has established systematic stakeholder dialogues with 
 selected relevant stakeholders. 
On the basis of our moderate assurance engagement to obtain moder-
ate degree of assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that, in all material respects the systems and processes 
implemented by the Company are not suitable for observing the Ac-
countAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness.
Furthermore, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to be-
lieve that
 > qualitative sustainability information set out in the Sustainability 
Report has not been prepared in compliance with the criteria set out 
in den Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pages 7 to 17) 
der Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); or

symbol and set out in the Sustainability Report has not been pre-
pared in compliance with the criteria set out in den Sustainability

emphasis of matter – recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusions stated above, we make the follow-
ing recommendations concerning the further development of the 
Company’s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
 > Further development of the stakeholder management by introduc-
ing a Group-wide framework, which defines the main requirements 
to deal with various aspects of stakeholder management;
 > Increase of efforts to standardize Group-wide definitions of key 
 figures ;
 > Increased formalization of processes and controls of the data collec-
tion, especially in the field of occupational safety;
 > Precise differentiation between Volkswagen Group and brand in the 
reporting;
 > Increase coverage ratio of the key figures for illustrating the Group-
perspective;
 > Increased formalization of the reporting process;
 > Advanced description of sustainability goal conflicts and dilemmas.

The Volkswagen Group’s Sustainability Report has been published 
annually since 2011. This report contains information about the 
Group’s sustainability activities in the 2013 financial year (January 
1 to December 31, 2013). The editorial deadline for the report, 
which is available in German and English, was January 31, 2014. 
The next Group  Sustainability Report will be published in the second 
quarter of 2015.
The Strategy chapter presents the fundamentals of the Group’s 
 strategy for implementing sustainable development across all its 
brands. The Economy, People and Environment chapters set out  
our management approach in each case before outlining how the 
 va rious aspects of these topics are implemented. The key Group- 
wide indicators and the overarching corporate sustainability road-
map are described in the Indicators and Goals chapter. Significant 
 changes in holdings or in the data acquisition process are described 
on pages 5 and 122.
True to the character of a progress report we aim to focus on the 
 essentials while at the same time communicating a balanced 
 pic ture of our activities that takes account of all Group brands and 
companies. Four Group companies – Audi, MAN, Scania and 
 ŠKODA – already publish their own sustainability reports, either 
annually or at two-year intervals. 2013 will be the first year cov-
 ered by a sustainability report from Porsche.
FundAmentAls
This report was drawn up in accordance with the G3 Guidelines of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). For the first time this involved 
the use of an IT system that in future will be expanded for Group- 
wide data acquisition and control activities, as well as for stake-
holder management within the Group. Important guidance in terms 
of content was provided by the questionnaires and appraisals of 
 sustainability-oriented rating agencies and RobecoSAM in parti c-
ular. We also took our lead from Stakeholder Engagement Standard 
AA1000 and had this verified by a firm of auditors.
To identify material topics we drew upon the findings of the 
 Volkswagen Group’s Stakeholder Panel which has been in place 
for many years now, as well as on the latest comprehensive stake-
holder surveys conducted by Group companies Audi, MAN, Porsche 
and Volkswagen Financial Services. The materiality matrix (see 
page 27) was validated by the Group CSR & Sustai nability Steering 
Group. The present report takes account not only of the recommen-
dations of the Stakeholder Panel, following its evaluation of the 2013 
Group Sustainability Report (see page 24), but also of the advice of 
the auditors who verified the 2012 Group Sustainability Report.
stAndARds
This report has been approved by the Board of Management of 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and verified by a firm of auditors 
(see page 150). It complies with the highest level of GRI reporting 
(GRI A+) as confirmed by a GRI Level Check (see page 147).  
Com pliance with the GRI indicators is shown in the GRI Content 
Index on page 144, as is the implementation of the relevant criteria 
for the Communication on Progress to the United Nations Global 
 Compact. The GRI Content Index also documents compliance with 
the German Sustainability Code.

The production of automobiles is based on a complex value chain. Sustainability must therefore be 
demonstrated throughout the entire process, including the upstream and downstream stages. This 
holistic principle applies throughout this report. 
Every year, the  Volks wa gen Group pur-
chases a wide range of raw materials, 
components and other goods. A sustainable 
supply chain and environmentally compati-
ble transportation solutions form an indis-
pensable part of demonstrating compre-
hensive responsibility for human rights, as 
well as a commitment to the environment 
and to the battle against corruption.

Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati,  Volks wa gen 
Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN. All brands in the Auto-
motive Division – with the exception of  Volks wa gen Passenger 
Cars and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles – are legally inde-
pendent, separate companies. 
 Volks wa gen AG is the parent company of the  Volks wa gen Group. 
It develops vehicles and components for the Group’s brands, but 
also produces and sells vehicles, in particular passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles from the  Volks wa gen Passenger 
Cars and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles brands. In its func-
tion as parent company,  Volks wa gen AG holds indirect or direct 
interests in AUDI AG, SEAT S.A., ŠKODA AUTO a.s., Dr. Ing. h.c. F. 
Porsche AG, Scania AB, MAN SE,  Volks wa gen Financial Services 
AG and a large number of other companies in Germany and 
abroad. More detailed disclosures are contained in the list of 
shareholdings in accordance with sections 285 and 313 of the 
Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code), which 
can be accessed at www. volks wa genag.com/ir and forms part of 
the annual financial statements. 
PRODUCTS
The  Volks wa gen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups 
in the automotive industry. The Company’s business activities 
comprise the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. The 
business activities of the various companies in the  Volks wa gen 
Group focus on developing, producing and selling passenger 
cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks and buses. The product 
portfolio ranges from motorcycles to fuel-efficient small cars and 
luxury vehicles. In the commercial vehicles segment, the offer-
ing begins with small pickups and extends to buses and heavy 
trucks. Other business fields include the manufacture of large-
bore diesel engines and special gear units, for example. A broad 
range of financial services completes the offering. 
LOCATIONS­AND­EMPLOYEES
The  Volks wa gen Group’s production network comprised 118 pro-
duction locations at the end of the reporting year (see pages 6 – 7). 
Europe remains the heart of our production activities with 72 ve-
hicle and component production locations, 29 of them in Germany 
alone. The significance of the Asia-Pacific region is continuously 
increasing, with a total of 29 production locations. In North Amer-
ica (four) and South America (nine) the number of locations re-
mained unchanged in the reporting year. In Africa the Group 
maintains four production locations. Almost 600,000 employees 
produce an average of 41,000 vehicles per working day or provide 
mobility-related services, or work in other business fields.
MARKETS
With its brands, the  Volks wa gen Group has a presence in all 
 relevant automotive markets around the world. Western Europe, 
China, Brazil, the USA, Russia and Mexico are currently the 
key sales markets for the Group. The Group maintained its 
strong competitive position in the reporting period thanks 
to its wide range of attractive and environmentally friendly 
models. We  recorded an encouraging increase in demand in 
many of our key markets. Worldwide, for the manufacture of its 
 products, the Group purchased goods and services to the value 
of €145.5 billion, an increase of 7.7% compared to the previous 
year. This  includes the purchasing volume for the Chinese 
joint venture companies. Suppliers in Germany accounted for 
a share of 36.1%.

The  Volks wa gen Group’s production network comprised 118 pro-
duction locations at the end of the reporting year. This figure is 
 based on a revised and harmonized method of counting locations, 
with the increase being largely accounted for by the commercial 
 vehicle sector. At the end of 2014 the production network included a 
total of 69 passenger car, commercial vehicle and motorcycle pro-
duction locations, as well as 49 locations manufacturing engines, 
transmissions and components. In November 2014, the Group’s 
 latest production location in China – a transmissions plant – opened 
in Tianjin. The location meets the highest standards in terms of 
both quality and environmental protection and is designed to man-
ufacture energy-efficient transmissions. By 2019 this will generate 
some 5,500 jobs in the region. All over the world,  Volks wa gen stands 
for eco-friendly mobility and production, as well as sustainable 
growth, based on state-of-the-art production processes and the 
 systematic reduction of energy consumption and emissions. A list 
of location certifications is available on the Internet:

Our world is changing at a breathtaking pace. Globali­
zation, new technologies and the Internet are the driv­
ing forces behind this change. Digitization is revo­
lutionizing our lives in the same radical way as the 
Industrial Revolution did 200 years ago. Computers, 
smartphones and robots are redefining how we com­
municate, shop and spend our free time, and what our 
day­to­day life at the office and in the factory looks like. 
Digitization is, of course, also changing the way we 
shape our mobility.
The car has entered a new era: the shift in society’s val­
ues and strict CO2 laws around the world are the forces 
behind a trend towards increasingly economical drive 
systems, electric mobility, lightweight design and 
 energy­efficient factories. Urbanization means a need 
for intelligent new transportation concepts. Constant 
growth in computing power, fast data networks and 
cheap memory are helping to keep people “always on”. 
Cars are becoming computers on wheels: engine and 
chassis management, driver assistance systems, nav­
igation, communications, infotainment systems and 
 automated driving are all developing at high speed.
But it’s not just the business environment that has un­
dergone far­reaching transformation over the past few 
years:  Volks wa gen itself has changed fundamentally 
as well. Just compare the Group today with what it was 
in 2007: the number of brands has increased from 
eight to twelve and our workforce too has shown rapid 
growth. We now employ a quarter of a million more 
people than we did in 2007. Our sales revenue has 
 almost doubled, to over €200 billion. Our operating 
profit has more than doubled. The number of produc­
tion locations has risen from 48 to 118. And since 2007 
we have added more than 180 models to our range. In 
sum, the  Volks wa gen Group has moved into new di­
mensions.
As I see it, our success is also founded in our ongoing 
willingness to regularly call our own approaches into 
question and then break new ground. In this way we 
have learned that our business is no longer just about 
technical aspects like horsepower and torque. We have 
learned that sustainability, environmental protection 
and social responsibility can be powerful value drivers. 
And we have learned to love electric drive – not just be­
cause it is so efficient, but also because it makes driving 
so much fun.
For current proof that today’s business models won’t au­
tomatically meet the needs of tomorrow’s world, consid­
er digitization. Digital networking is radically chang­
ing not only our vehicles, our plants and our employees’ 
jobs but also our relationships with our customers. But 
we are ready for this change. In fact, our ambition is to 
be the engine that drives this change, and now we are 
stepping up the pace again. We are bringing the digital 
world to our vehicles and connecting in­vehicle sensors 
with our data centers. This way our vehicle fleet will be­
come an intelligent swarm, providing us with a spring­
board from which to launch new mobility services. 
 Real­time data is also needed for partially automated 
driving and intelligent traffic management in city 
centers or on motorways. Our factories too are in line 
for the next major automation step change. Fully net­
worked manufacturing in line with Industry 4.0 is 
 beginning to take shape. Machines are relieving our 
employees of monotonous, non­ergonomic tasks and 
boosting productivity. Robots are moving out of their 
protective cages and will work side by side or even hand 
in hand with people in the future. And in the sales sec­
tor the Internet has become the most important show­
room. Now the focus is on seamlessly connecting the

virtual, digital world with the real one. Using big data 
intelligently also allows us to develop new software 
solutions and service offerings for cars that give our 
customers genuine added value and open up additional 
business opportunities for our Company.
So is this a brave new digital automotive world? There 
are, of course, fundamental questions that still need to 
be answered: will the factories of tomorrow be empty of 
people? Is the traffic infrastructure prepared for the 
opportunities the digital world has to offer? And how 
can we protect customer data from misuse? We are 
aware of our responsibilities and are addressing all of 
these issues carefully. At the same time, I urge you to 
look not just at the risks, but more particularly at the 
 opportunities that digitization presents. Not only will 
driving become more comfortable and safer for people; 
at the same time, we will also reduce the impact on the 
environment through optimum utilization of our re­
sources. Exciting opportunities for new technologies 
and business ideas are emerging for industry, and 
these can lead to growth and prosperity.
Above all, new trends and new technologies ultimately 
mean one thing: new business opportunities. But com­
petition for future mobility is ruthless and success is 
never guaranteed, not least because the business envi­
ronment in which we operate is tougher than ever. Con­
sequently, politicians too need to be more fully aware of 
the scale of the challenges we face. Because the politi­
cal framework is always a key factor in determining suc­
cess or failure.
Despite all the challenges, I am convinced that we can 
and must bring the digital and the mobile worlds to­
gether. That is why digitization is one of the major com­
ponents of our Group­wide “Future Tracks” program, 
which we launched in spring 2014. 
On our road to the new digital world of mobility, there is 
one thing we cannot afford to neglect, and that is to en­
sure that people – our customers, partners and employ­
ees – can travel with us. Focus, safety and security, and 
trust – these values are and will remain the foundation 
for technological progress.

OUR APPROACH
For the  Volks wa gen Group, sustainability means that we conduct 
our business activities on a responsible and long-term basis and do 
not seek short-term success at the expense of others. Our intention 
is that everyone should profit from our growth – our customers and 
investors, society and, of course, our employees. In this way, good 
jobs and careful treatment of resources and the environment form 
the basis for generating lasting values. This applies on all conti-
nents and in all regions and throughout the entire value chain. In 
future, revisiting and implementing this approach in the light of 
digitization – and responsibly handling the digitization process 
itself – will be a key factor shaping the strategic issues of our sus-
tainability management.
To ensure consistent and focused pursuit of our objectives, we aim 
to concentrate on essentials (see pages 16 – 18). The challenges are 
immense. They range from climate change, resource availability 
and demographic developments, through far-reaching changes in 
society’s values, to digitization, rapid urbanization and increasing 
social imbalances. 
As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, our Group 
with its twelve strong brands bears a special social responsibility 
and we intend to put our creative powers to good use for the benefit 
of people and the environment. Every year the  Volks wa gen Group 
produces more than 10 million vehicles. This gives rise to positive 
effects such as new jobs, regional prosperity and individual oppor-
tunities for participation, but also to emissions and resource con-
sumption. Our most important tasks, as we see it, are therefore to 
ensure responsible and efficient production, and to make mobility 
not only as safe, convenient and environmentally compatible as 
possible, but at the same time affordable for large numbers of 
people. After all, individual mobility remains a basic human need, 
and fulfilling this need is the central corporate objective of our 
Group. 
Through pioneering technologies and social competence we are 
making our contribution to a sustainable form of development that 
will give future generations the same opportunities as the present 
generation has. In view of digitization, we will in future be faced 
with new issues in the field of sustainability and responsibility – 
for example, what we do with our customers’ data, how we ensure 
that they are secure and protected at all times, and what legal and 
ethical problems are raised by automated driving. This also means 
that to some extent we need to reconsider and redefine the key 
 aspects of our activities.
 
 V  Twelve brands, each with its own unique 
character, sharing a common goal: 
 mobility  – for everyone, everywhere.
Our Sustainability Strategy
We know that growth can only take place hand in hand with 
 responsibility and environmental protection – more than that, 
in fact: in recent years these factors have become genuine value 
 drivers. That is why everything we do in the interests of sustain-
ability also serves to achieve our corporate objectives – in an 
 accompanying, promoting and supporting capacity. The key 
 aspects of our sustainability objectives and activities, which are 
subject to Group-wide control, are structured under the three 
headings used in this report – Economy, People and Environ-
ment. This reflects not only our Group-wide interpretation of 
sustainability that can be applied in all regions around the 
world, but also our conviction that stable, long-term business 
activity based on ethical criteria is a precondition for acting in 
an environment-friendly way and playing a responsible part in 
shaping the future of people within the Group and in society at 
large. 
With almost 600,000 employees and 118 production locations 
on four continents, we are especially concerned to do this con-
sistently worldwide. Our approach: to transfer tried-and-tested 
ideas – from brand to brand, from region to region. There are 
already  numerous examples of how this works – from the modular 
FOCUSING ON THE 
 ESSENTIALS. 
We aim to be the world’s most successful, fascinating and sustainable automobile manufacturer. 
This is the target we set ourselves for 2018, and we have already achieved some of our aims.  
In a world that is undergoing ever more radical changes, however, targets can never be more than 
 milestones: reach them and they are already out of date. With the advent of digitization, the 
 industry and the Group are on the cusp of a new era – one we aim to play a major role in shaping.

transverse matrix, via the dual vocational education and train-
ing system and in-service training opportunities that we bring to 
the various regions, to mobility services, concepts for road safety 
and social responsibility, and biodiversity projects. In this way 
we turn our size and growth to good advantage and exercise our 
responsibility for our employees, the environment and society.
Managing Challenges and Trends 
 GRI G4-18 
Even if the major challenges are known and can be assessed, the 
resulting demands on the  Volks wa gen Group are nevertheless 
subject to increasingly rapid change and have to be reassessed at 
regular intervals and readjusted in our strategic planning. Within 
the  Volks wa gen Group we therefore have several specialized func-
tions engaged in observing megatrends in society, analyzing the 
overall economic backdrop, tracking emerging customer trends 
and continuous benchmarking against the competition. The re-
sults are brought together in a process known as the planning 
round. This ensures that the important decisions for production, 
purchasing and sales structures are taken with a ten-year time-
line. Another instrument for identifying challenges and expecta-
tions and for dealing with changing background conditions is the 
stakeholder dialogue, which we cultivate at both Group and mar-
ket level (see pages 23 – 27). 
 V  Growth with responsibility for 
 employees, environment and society
In summer 2014, based on these observations and derived from 
the major challenges, we identified for the  Volks wa gen Group 16 
areas in which we can and must make a special contribution – 
 because these are fields where we have a significant impact or 
where we are particularly well placed to exert influence, and 
where consequently a great deal is also expected of us.

Materiality Analysis 
 GRI G4-18, G4-25, G4-26 
In 2014, two mutually independent developments played a role in 
a detailed analysis of the topics of material importance to the 
 Volks wa gen Group. One particular issue was the question of the 
Group’s strategy for the period after 2018, which has sparked lively 
discussions. Important sustainability topics that impact on the 
Company’s performance are covered by risk management (see 
page 22). The findings of the discussions were also taken into 
 account when defining the key action areas. In addition, there 
were the GRI’s new requirements (GRI-G4), which pay greater 
 attention to the process of materiality analysis. In practice, our 
 approach to the analysis and identification of significant issues 
was as follows:
1. From global challenges we derived a list of 16 central action 
 areas in which we need to provide answers. We did this on the 
basis of the following sources: external studies, industry analy-
ses and our brands’ stakeholder surveys, and also internal 
guidelines such as the Strategy 2018, the Group Environmen-
tal Strategy, or key factors identified by the Corporate Strategy 
Group. 
The  Volks wa gen Group is one of the leading suppliers of alternative drive systems. With 1,354 units sold by the end of 2014, the best-selling electric car to 
date is the e-up!•. 
2. To obtain an additional assessment of the importance of these 
action areas for the Company, we conducted an online analy-
sis of international media for the period September 2013 to 
August 2014. This revealed that eco-friendly products in the 
context of the automotive industry, and especially in connec-
tion with the  Volks wa gen Group, were by far the most widely 
discussed issues, followed by intelligent mobility, customer 
satisfaction, quality and employment. 
3. On the basis of the assessments obtained in the first two steps, 
the action areas were then discussed and defined in two fur-
ther steps. The following served as our central criteria: stake-
holder expectations, the potential contribution to the Group’s 
strategic objectives, and the difference between these two 
 criteria. This analysis was first performed in the Group CSR 
Meeting with representatives of the brands and regions, and 
finally in the Corporate CSR & Sustainability Steering Group. 
4. Detailed discussions in each case led to the realization that in 
view of the Group’s size, its potential influence and the associat-
ed responsibility, all the issues in the GRI list of sustainability 
aspects can and must be regarded as “significant” for the 
 Volks wa gen Group.

This representation of the 16 central action areas, broken down 
into the three dimensions Economy, People and Environment, is 
intended to illustrate the aspects that we focus on in order to 
 become the world’s most sustainable automaker. In view of our 
broad international standing, we have deliberately avoided any 
prioritization of our action areas. On the one hand, the relevance 
of the individual areas may vary depending on the region; on the 
other hand, we do not want to judge, for example, whether the 
health of nearly 600,000 employees worldwide is more important 
than  resource conservation throughout the vehicle life cycle – or 
vice versa. As we understand it, sustainable development means 
taking equal account of economic, environmental and social in-
terests and maintaining an appropriate balance between them. In 
other words, the 16 action areas that apply across the Group stand 
side by side, even if current developments place a greater short- 
or  medium-term focus on individual topics. In the interests of 
the  future success of our business, taking a long-term view is of 
decisive importance for us.

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
The  Volks wa gen Group has made a commitment to sustainabili-
ty-oriented, transparent and responsible management. The great-
est challenge to putting this into practice at all levels and in all stag-
es of the value chain is our complexity, with twelve brands,  nearly 
600,000 employees and 118 production locations. In line with the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, we 
practice Group-wide sustainability coordination and forward- 
looking risk management and ensure a clear framework for the 
 future-oriented handling of environmental issues, responsibility 
towards our employees and social engagement by our brands and 
in the various regions. The remuneration of the Group Board of 
 Management is geared to the Company’s long-term results.
Guidelines and Principles
Voluntary undertakings and principles that apply across the Group 
form the basis and backbone of our strategic sustainability objec-
tives. These include the following:
 >  Volks wa gen Group values: Our position is defined by seven val-
ues. These are customer focus, top performance, creating value, 
ability to renew, respect, responsibility and sustainability 
(2002). 
 7
 >  Volks wa gen Model of Sustainable Development: Adopted in 
2002 to mark the UN World Summit in Johannesburg (South 
 Africa), this provides a Group-wide framework for sustainable 
and responsible action.

We have created our own framework for this purpose in the 
 Volks wa gen Social Charter, the Charter on Labour Relations and 
the Charter on Temporary Work, all of which apply throughout the 
Group (see pages 62 – 65). Group-wide environmental protection 
is governed by the Group Environmental Policy and the Group-
wide environmental principles governing products and produc-
tion (see page 87).

 V GROUP CSR MEETING
To promote dialogue across the Group, set up uniform structures 
and learn from one another, the CSR & Sustainability Coordinators 
of all brands and regions have met once a year since 2009. The 
Group CSR Meeting has thus become an important element in the 
Group-wide coordination structure. In 2014 the two-day meeting 
was held in Brussels. The agenda included a joint assessment of 
 important sustainability issues in preparation for the Materiality 
Analysis to be signed off by the Corporate CSR and Sustainability 
Steering Group (see pages 16 – 18).  
Functions and Composition of the Management Bodies
The Group Board of Management has nine members. Every 
member is responsible for one or more functions, and some 
members also have responsibility for a region. The Group Board 
of Management is supported in its work by the boards and man-
agement teams of the brands and regions, and of the other Group 
companies and affiliated companies. In accordance with the 
German Co-determination Act the Supervisory Board, which 
appoints, oversees and advises the Board of Management, is 
made up of equal numbers of representatives of the sharehold-
ers and representatives of the employees. The Supervisory 
Board of the  Volks wa gen Group has a total of 20 members, three 
of whom are women. Clear ideas, including diversity targets, 
have been formulated for the composition of the Supervisory 
Board. For example, at least three seats should be held by indi-
viduals of a particularly international character. In addition, 
at least three seats on the Supervisory Board are to be held by 
women, at least two of whom should be representatives of the 
shareholders.
Coordination of Sustainability 
The  Volks wa gen Group has established a clear structure for coor-
dinating CSR and sustainability. The top sustainability body is the 
Group Board of Management, referred to here as the Sustainabili-
ty Board. At least twice a year the Sustainability Board is informed 
by the Corporate CSR & Sustainability Steering Group about topics 
relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability. The Corpo-
rate CSR & Sustainability Steering Group includes top managers 
from central Group business areas, members of the Group Works 
Council and representatives of the brands and regions. It meets 
four times a year, decides on the strategic sustainability goals and 
signs off the Sustainability Report. 
The Corporate CSR & Sustainability Steering Group is supported 
by the CSR & Sustainability Office, which has coordinated all 
 sustainability-relevant activities within the Group and the brands 
since 2006. Its remit also includes the stakeholder dialogue con-
ducted at Group level, including relations with sustainability- 
oriented analysts and investors. There are also several dedicated 
project teams, each working at crossfunctional level on tasks such 
as sustainability reporting or sustainability in supplier relations. 
These coordination and working structures have, with a few excep-
tions, also been established within the  Volks wa gen Group’s brands 
and are constantly being expanded. Group-wide sustainability 
 reporting underwent further structuring and extension in 2014, 
once the data for the 2013 Group Sustainability Report had been 
captured for the first time in an IT-based information system.

 V REMUNERATION OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
The remuneration of the Group Board of Management consists of a 
fixed and a variable component. The variable component is made 
up of a bonus based on the performance of the business in the 
preceding two years, and (since 2010) a long-term incentive (LTI) 
which is based on a consideration of the preceding four financial 
years. Thus both elements of the variable component are based on 
multi-year assessment criteria and take account of both favorable 
and unfavorable developments.

Coordination of Environmental, Personnel and  
Social Engagement Issues
In 2011 the  Volks wa gen Group took an important decision for the 
ecological restructuring of the Group by appointing a Group Chief 
Officer for the Environment, Energy and New Business Areas. 
The Environmental Strategy was approved by the Group Board of 
Management at the end of 2013 (see pages 86 – 87). Since then, 
work has been in progress on implementing it within the Group 
and the individual brands. The Group Environmental Confer-
ence, at which the environmental officers of the brands and 
 regions meet regularly, has been in place since as long ago as 
1998. The last meeting was held in 2012, and the next will be in 
2015. Through the Corporate Environment and Energy Steering 
Group, which also reports to the Sustainability Board, the coordi-
nation of environmental issues follows the structure described 
above for CSR & Sustainability. 
The framework for coordination of employee responsibility is 
 defined by the Corporate Personnel Management department 
and implemented locally. In 2013 a personnel management 
strategy to support the Group goals for 2018 was adopted (see 
page 56). Social engagement falls largely within the responsi-
bility of the brands, companies and locations. To ensure a cer-
tain standardization worldwide, the Group has defined central 
principles (see pages 73 – 75).
RISK MANAGEMENT
The  Volks wa gen Group’s responsible and forward-looking ap-
proach to risks is supported by a comprehensive risk manage-
ment and internal control system (RMS/ICS). This is based on 
the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk Manage-
ment Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission). We pursue a holistic, integrating 
approach that combines the risk management system, internal 
control system and compliance management system in a single 
Governance, Risk & Compliance strategy. As a result, the RMS/
ICS ensures full coverage of all potential risk areas. The central 
body responsible is the Group Board of Management, which 
is informed about risks and opportunities in connection with 
a wide variety of processes. The Supervisory Board’s Audit 
Committee receives regular reports on the effectiveness of the 
RMS/ICS. 
As an integral part of our structures and procedures, our RMS is 
embedded in the day-to-day business processes of the  Volks wa gen 
Group. It pursues the “Three Lines of Defense” approach:
 >  The first line is the essential task of the divisions, companies and 
brands. Thanks to reports during the year via the paths docu-
mented above, the Board has an overall picture of the current 
risk situation at all times. The minimum requirements for the 
RMS/ICS are laid down in a single guidance document for the 
entire Group. This also includes a process for timely notification 
of significant risks. 
 > The second line is the Group Governance, Risk & Compliance 
(GRC) department. This sets standards for the RMS/ICS and 
 coordinates the annual GRC standard process. In this process, 
the brands, major companies and individual functions identify 
risks and verify the effectiveness of the RMS/ICS. This serves as 
a basis for updating the overall picture of the potential risk situa-
tion and assessing the effectiveness of the system. The Group 
Board of Management receives a report on significant risks, 
which are also defined in terms of quantitative and qualitative 
assessment criteria and a probability rating. 
 >  The third line is Group Internal Audit, which makes regular 
checks on the structure and implementation of the RMS as part 
of its independent audit activities.
 V  Being aware of our stakeholders’  
expectations is an important  
precondition for business success.
Significant Risks 
The biggest risks – i.e. risks with a high probability of occurrence 
and involving a large financial loss – may arise from adverse sales 
and market trends for vehicles and genuine parts, development 
and creation of products not suited to demand, and potential qual-
ity problems.
Risks that could impact on the financial result of the  Volks wa gen 
Group also include general environmental risks and climate 
change risks. Under the RMS these are identified, assessed and 
controlled by the Group’s divisions and companies. Examples of 
such risks include the following:
 > Extreme weather situations, storms or floods leading to failure 
of information and communication technology, supplier failure 
with production standstill or general production downtime at 
one of our more than 100 production locations worldwide.
 >  The differences in CO2 regulations between the major volume 
 markets, which involve a variety of sanction mechanisms. Emis-
sion  requirements for vehicle taxation also play an important role 
here.
23
 > Alongside the risks described, the development of new drive 
technologies (hybrid and electric) may result in advantages com-
pared with our competitors. In view of a broad change in public 
awareness based on the depletion of fossil resources and a grow-
ing desire to protect the environment, these technologies pro-
mote the Group’s sales opportunities. 
For more information on economic, political, financial and opera-
tional risks, see the Risks and Opportunities section of the Man-
agement Report.

STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT 
 GRI G4-25
Being aware of our stakeholders’ needs and expectations is an 
 important precondition for business success. They determine the 
development of our sales markets, the various regulatory frame-
works and our reputation as a Group. That is why we seek and 
maintain a dialogue with our stakeholders, both at Group level 
and locally in the regions where we operate. Our stakeholders 
 include analysts and investors, employees, customers, neighbors, 
suppliers, partners, politicians, public authorities, scientists and 
non-governmental organizations – a network of relationships that 
grows with our market presence.

Stakeholder Relations at Group Level
Direct contact with stakeholders, especially employees, partners 
and customers, is cultivated above all by the brands. At Group level 
we seek to bundle these processes and take an overarching ap-
proach to discussing Group-wide topics. This includes our dia-
logue with politicians, academia and non-governmental organi-
zations. Our aim is to understand and respond to stakeholders’ 
expectations and promote appreciation of our positions and ac-
tions. In order to achieve this, we strive to continuously intensify 
the process of dialogue with our stakeholders. Reflecting these ef-
forts, a broad spectrum of stakeholder groups showed great appre-
ciation of the  Volks wa gen Group’s early commitment to the Euro-
pean politicians’ target of reducing average passenger car fleet 
CO2 emissions to 95 grams per kilometer by 2020.

 V DIALOGUE WITH POLITICIANS
We maintain an ongoing dialogue with politicians to provide infor-
mation and advice. In this process we not only react, but also take 
a proactive stance, offering our own solutions for discussion and 
stimulating innovations in the field of social policy. In view of 
global warming, regulation of CO2 emissions in the transportation 
sector was again the main topic of political stakeholder groups in 
numerous countries and regions in 2014.  Volks wa gen committed 
itself at an early stage to the emission limit of 95 g CO2/km in the 
EU which was set in 2014. In the second half of the reporting year, 
we successfully promoted the idea that a post-2020 target should 
not be set until it became clear how quickly the market for electric 
mobility would take off. In fact the new EU Commission declared 
its intention of using 2015 first of all for stakeholder dialogues and 
impact assessments. On the trade policy front the free-trade 
agreements with the USA (TTIP) and Canada (CETA) occupied our 
attention. 
 12
At Group level we particularly cultivate membership of organiza-
tions that involve an intensive dialogue on sustainable develop-
ment issues and contribute to networking with sustainability- 
oriented businesses and our stakeholders. At international level 
these primarily include our engagement with the prestigious 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), 
our participation in CSR Europe, a leading European network for 
social responsibility, and our work within the network of the UN 
Global Compact. We are also an active member of econsense, the 
sustainable development forum of German industry, and the 
 international initiative “Biodiversity in Good Company”. The 
 information we gain from these sources is passed on to the brands 
and regions. Details of Group membership of other organizations 
can be found on the Internet. 
 14
Our dialogue with stakeholders naturally includes taking a critical 
look at aspects of our own activities. One example in 2014 came 
at the Annual General Meeting, when the question of the compa-
ny’s role during the military dictatorship in Brazil was raised. We

OUR APPROACH
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT
STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
pursued a policy of open communication and are working to come 
to terms with this chapter of the company’s history. At the opening 
of the São Paulo International Motor Show, Greenpeace do Brasil 
called upon  Volks wa gen and other major manufacturers to offer 
more efficient vehicles. In response, we gave Greenpeace a de-
tailed explanation of our product strategy. As a basic principle, our 
answers to inquiries are prompt and open. In 2014, for example, 
we provided LobbyControl with a statement on our activities and 
answered a question from Greenpeace about the German energy 
revolution or “Energiewende”. 
To ensure a systematic approach to stakeholder management 
within the Group, in 2014 we introduced an IT-based issue and 
stakeholder module. This will help to assess the importance of 
 individual stakeholder groups and link this evaluation with the 
 assessment of issues. It thus forms the basis for a stakeholder- 
oriented issues management system which supports the Group’s 
reputation and ensures closer coordination of the brands’ stake-
holder activities.
Stakeholder Panel and Evaluation
In cooperation with the Institute for Market, Environment and 
 Society (imug) we established a stakeholder panel which has fol-
lowed our activities, especially our environmental and sustaina-
bility activities, for the past 18 years and produces a critical com-
mentary every year. During the past year this procedure, which 
had involved detailed interviews with 33 representatives of vari-
ous stakeholder groups, was extended to take in a further 18 in-
ternational stakeholder representatives. This paved the way for 
interesting comparisons and improved our understanding of 
 expectations outside the European region. The purpose of this 
LOBBYING: 
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OF HANDLING DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
Lobbying does not enjoy a good reputation, especially in Germany. It is said that lobbyists are used by associations 
and businesses to exert influence on political decisions by obscure means, and that they frequently resort to 
 dubious methods. The automotive industry in particular is accused of exploiting its economic power and thereby 
undermining the democratic process of formulating objectives.
Nobody would deny that lobbyists can stray from the 
straight and narrow. Rule-breaking, and corruption in par-
ticular, must be punished. On the other hand this general 
 rejection of  lobbying, and the widespread aversion in Ger-
many to the supposed egoism of the stakeholder groups, are 
exaggerated and unacceptable – after all, they are based on 
pre-democratic ideals.
In a pluralist society it is necessary – and perfectly legitimate 
– to represent particular interests vis-à-vis politicians. It is not 
only large corporate groups that engage in lobbying – trade 
unions, religious groups and environmental associations do so 
as well (and sometimes exhibit greater skill in equating their 
concerns with the public interest). Ultimately what matters is 
that all stakeholder interests are heard and weighed up in the 
political process. That is the essence of democracy.
The  Volks wa gen Group has 118 production locations and nearly 
600,000 employees worldwide. A company with such a great 
responsibility for vocational education and training, employ-
ment and regional development, prosperity and quality of life 
has to have a fundamental interest in ensuring that political de-
cisions are taken on the basis of objective considerations and 
do not place obstacles in the way of future business success.
Politicians have to rely on the expertise of the social and busi-
ness players, on the knowledge and experience of those in the 
front line. We at  Volks wa gen assure politicians of full and 
open information and reliable and competent advice. We be-
lieve in the kind of lobbying that aims to convince people with 
better arguments and is prepared to expose itself to public 
criticism.  
During 2014 we again engaged in a thorough discussion of the 
guiding principles of our work as a political stakeholder group, 
and signed them off at the beginning of 2015. They are availa-
ble to everyone on the Internet, and you are welcome to com-
ment on them.

evaluation is to constantly reassess and improve the sustainability 
report, its impact and its benefits for the target groups. Further-
more, stakeholders’ assessments often provide an indication of 
weaknesses in our Group-wide sustainability coordination. The 
2013 Group Sustainability Report was generally very well received, 
though the  international stakeholder representatives rated it bet-
ter than the German ones. 
 V ASSESSMENT OF THE 2013 GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
The assessment of the 2013 Group Sustainability Report by the 
 extended stakeholder panel proved positive. The main suggestions 
for improvement included: providing more opportunities for dia-
logue, taking a more open approach to critical issues, describing 
conflicts of objectives, and formulating clearer and more far-reach-
ing objectives. At a meeting on November 20, 2014, representatives 
of the stakeholder panel stressed the need to focus on important 
topics, identify dilemmas and outline a perspective running beyond 
the year 2018. The present report takes up these suggestions with 
the comprehensive materiality analysis (pages 16 – 18), the state-
ment on special focus topics (pages 25, 41, 90) and a full account of 
future challenges and strategic guidelines (pages 12 – 13, 32 – 33, 
54 – 55 and 84 – 85). A summary of the extended stakeholder pan-
el’s assessment of the 2013 Group Sustainability Report is available 
on the Internet.

Stakeholder Dialogue at Brand and Company Level
Once a year we use the “Stimmungsbarometer”, our standardized 
Group-wide employee opinion survey, to measure employee satis-
faction. In recent years the Audi, MAN, Porsche, SEAT,  Volks wa gen 
and  Volks wa gen Financial Services brands have also conducted 
extensive and detailed stakeholder surveys, usually online, which 
have yielded valuable findings for identifying issues of importance 
for the Group as a whole. All in all, the surveys covered some 
126,000 stakeholder respondents, though it should be noted that 
120,000 of these were due to the  Volks wa gen brand’s customer 
survey. In the meantime the brands have largely moved on to more 
individual and differentiated forms of stakeholder dialogue, with 
the aim of acquiring more detailed information about individual 
issues or about the expectations of specific stakeholder groups. 
 V BRAND DIALOGUES AND FORUMS
In October 2014 Audi held its second stakeholder forum: some 120 
participants met in Berlin to discuss future mobility and the role 
that digital data will play in this context. The focus was on issues 
arising from networking of vehicles with each other, with the infra-
structure and with the driver. Core findings from the forum are fed 
into the development of Audi’s technologies of the future. Audi also 
offers its employees the opportunity to discuss corporate responsi-
bility and sustainability with representatives of business, academia, 
politics and NGOs: the series of lectures on “Responsibility Perspec-
tives” looks into future issues, business and social developments 
and the associated challenges. 
Early in 2014, MAN invited students of the master’s course in “Sus-
tainable Marketing & Leadership” at the Fresenius University in 
 Munich to take part in a joint discussion to assess MAN’s Corporate 
Responsibility Strategy and goals, and its performance from the 
point of view of future managers. The findings resulted in a state-
ment which contained both praise and criticism and was published 
as the Challenger Statement in the 2014 MAN CR Report.
At the second Audi Stakeholder Forum in Berlin in 2014 the focus was on future mobility.
27
For the past 16 years  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles has been 
 engaged in a dialogue with its neighbors at the Hanover location in 
Germany, because the factory is situated close to residential areas. 
For some years now, similar discussions have also been taking place 
at our Pozna´n location in Poland. Meetings are held every six 
months to discuss stakeholders’ concerns and misgivings with a 
view to finding joint solutions. These are attended not only by local 
residents, but also by representatives of local authorities, official 
bodies and religious groups.
Cooperation for Sustainability
Both the  Volks wa gen Group and the individual brands have long 
been engaged in close cooperation with official bodies, local 
 authorities, and organizations representing environmental and 
social concerns. This is prompted by a desire not only to play a 
supportive role in society, but also to find out more about external 
perspectives of the Group’s activities. In 2014, in addition to its 
long-standing partnership with Naturschutzbund Deutschland 
(NABU), the  Volks wa gen Group entered into cooperation with 
the German Red Cross. This was preceded by a phase of building 
mutual trust and comparing expectations. This cooperation 
 began on a project-specific basis in the field of rescue services in 
Germany and innovations in first aid training. The Group’s 
 established cooperation partners also include GIZ (Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH), SOS 
Kinderdorf (MAN), and “My Finance Coach” to promote general 
financial education ( Volks wa gen Financial Services).  
 V COOPERATION WITH NABU
Naturschutzbund Deutschland e.V. (NABU) is accompanying us in 
a process of “critical dialogue” on our way to becoming the most 
sustainable automaker. In 2014 the issues at the heart of this 
 ongoing technical exchange of views were once again climate pro-
tection,  resource efficiency and biodiversity. In October 2014 
 Martin  Winterkorn, Chairman of the Group Board of Management, 
held a summit meeting with NABU President Olaf Tschimpke. As 
well as communication, environment, sales and financial services, 
the dialogue covered the service field and – for the first time ever – 
the logistics sector. A “Mobile Dialogue” forum in Berlin with 
 experts from politics and public authorities engaged in close scruti-
ny of  Volks wa gen’s environmental protection as a whole. A major 
moorland protection conference in June 2014 generated further 
 political momentum. On a smaller scale we also had a number of 
meetings with representatives of other environmental NGOs to 
 discuss issues such as refrigerants in air-conditioning systems. The 
partners again mobilized a broad public for joint objectives in the 
field of environmental protection and nature conservation (e.g. 
“Smart driving saves fuel” training courses, the “Welcome Wolf!” 
cross-media campaign, marketing relating to moorland conserva-
tion, and promotion of renaturing program for the River Havel). 
With its broad spectrum of issues and fields and types of action, the 
dialogue and project partnership with NABU, which in its fifteenth 
year can itself claim to be sustainable, has become a model of 
cross-sectoral cooperation between companies and NGOs. We use 
a bundle of indicators to measure its success, for example the 
 willingness of politicians and the public to participate, the market 
response to the eco-leasing program, the satisfaction expressed by 
NABU, and their readiness to put in a good word for us vis-à-vis 
third parties. We provide extensive information – not least online – 
on the progress of the projects. A blog invites committed members 
 of the public to engage in dialogue.

Reporting und Issues Management
The greater the significance of sustainability aspects for the align-
ment of the Group’s strategy, the more important assessment, 
management and reporting of the topics becomes. Internal and 
external sustainability reporting plays an important part in the 
Group’s strategic development – because it facilitates coordination 
by creating internal transparency and bundling issues. In relations 
with the various external stakeholder groups, sustainability reports 
create the basis for dialogue, communication and trust. They also 
comply with politicians’ growing demands for transparency. 
The Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania and ŠKODA brands prepare their 
own sustainability reports following the guidelines of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI). The other companies provide target 
group-oriented information on the topic. In 2014 a Group guide-
line was drawn up to regulate the form and standard of reporting 
for the Group Sustainability Report, the brands’ sustainability re-
ports and other forms of sustainability reporting, and also the or-
ganizational structure and the supply of data and responsibilities 
for the Group, brands, companies and locations.

Geopolitical uncertainties, growth imbalances and 
economic power shifts:  these developments represent 
the “new normality” in which we operate today. One-
time certainties are being consigned to the past; uncer-
tainty is becoming our constant companion. We are ex-
periencing a volatility in economic affairs such as we 
have not witnessed for many years. Who would have 
thought, for example, that the price of oil could fall so 
dramatically in the wake of the fracking boom and a 
global slowdown in demand? 
At the same time globalization has entered a new evolu-
tionary phase; the days when this process was one-way 
traffic are long gone. Asia, in particular, is amassing 
capital on a gigantic scale. New competitors – global 
competitors to be seriously reckoned with – are appear-
ing in many sectors, including ours. The power rela-
tionships in the global economy are shifting, so it is 
 important that trade barriers between the industrial 
nations continue to be dismantled – even if the popular-
ity of the concept of free trade has sadly diminished in 
recent times. The current negotiations on the Trans-
atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership provide a 
clear illustration of how important a free trade agree-
ment is when it comes to establishing common stand-
ards and regulations to facilitate trade. 
When talking about the “new normality” we cannot 
overlook the radical social changes taking place around 
us, changes with impacts on our business that we are 
only beginning to glimpse. The so-called “sharecono-
my” has already changed many aspects of modern life – 
from finding somewhere to stay in foreign cities all the 
way to taxi rides. We share our data with co-workers in 
the cloud – and the automobile as a shared asset has 
also become a central component of various business 
models. 
The disruptive impact of digitization is transforming 
operational paradigms across many sectors: Who de-
cides what the markets of the future will look like? Will 
our future competitors be the same as those we face to-
day? With digitization our industry is facing a further 
shift toward automation – yet above all we will be seeing 
the emergence of new business models, relating not just 
to infotainment but also to areas such as mobility ser-
vices and after-sales. At the same time a more general 
increase in environmental awareness combined with 
more stringent environmental legislation is also gener-
ating new business models and new competitors.  
The continuing development of low-emission drive 
 systems is the second major technological revolution 
directly impacting our industry. Electric mobility is 
a key pillar when it comes to reaching the EU’s CO2- 
targets for 2020. And yet we still cannot tell which 
technology will come to the fore. So the current chal-
lenge is to configure a phased transition to the new 
energy-efficient technologies. Given the uncertainties 
mentioned above, however, this also means higher 
levels of risk and major expenditure for both R&D and 
production. 
Above all, the challenge now is to re-align the way we 
think and operate in order to confront effectively and 
successfully the technological and economic change to 
which our business is exposed. This requires solid

 finances, creativity, flexibility and speed of response, 
robust business models outside our established mar-
kets, a further diversification and regionalization of 
our product portfolio, and a sustained drive to localize 
production and procurement. Because in the volume 
segment we can only remain competitive if we signifi-
cantly increase local value creation. Given an annual 
procurement volume of €145.5 billion and the fact that 
a large proportion of our sales revenue is generated in 
foreign currencies, ensuring the highest possible level 
of localization is an important factor in hedging against 
currency fluctuations. 
We will also need to make considerable investments in 
our products in order to deliver shorter product cycles 
and meet regulatory requirements. To generate the 
funds we need to fuel this journey into our automotive 
future, we need to generate an ongoing increase in our 
efficiency. With our modular matrixes we are ideally 
equipped to achieve this: they provide the perfect basis 
for delivering economic efficiency in production and a 
rapid response to changes in our operating environ-
ment – be they shifts in customer preferences or new 
CO2 legislation – across the whole of our portfolio. 
As yet we don’t know exactly what the automobile of 
the future will look like. But as a robust company that 
is well positioned in terms of both finance and strategy, 
we will come up with innovative answers. With respect 
to the key issues for the future, however, we are to 
some extent dependent on regulatory, fiscal and social 
factors – and thus also reliant on politicians setting 
wise parameters, as well as creating and preserving 
room for entrepreneurial initiative. Since the econom-
ic and  financial crisis, however, the regulatory environ-
ment has become increasingly dense. Conversely, trust 
in companies, indeed in the entire market economy 
system, is diminishing. Politics and business must 
therefore work together to seek a healthy balance be-
tween necessary regulation and entrepreneurial free-
dom, in order to maintain an attractive economic sys-
tem founded on personal responsibility and individual 
initiative.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Faced with challenges such as globalization, digitization or in-
creasing regulation, it is more essential than ever for us to opti-
mize processes across all of our brands, develop new and innova-
tive products, and invest in our locations and in our employees. In 
fact, to further expand our market presence and access new mar-
kets we must first redefine mobility, and that new definition ex-
tends from electric mobility and automated driving all the way to 
networked mobility systems. Playing a pioneering role here is go-
ing to call for major investments. 
As we strive to maintain and reinforce our economic stability 
against the backdrop of shifting markets and economic uncertain-
ty, we continue to put our trust in the enormous diversification of 
our product portfolio and in broadbased positioning in the global 
markets. Our policy of adding maximum value at local level not 
only brings us many economic advantages but also reduces our 
risk exposure (see page 40). At the same time, this approach plays 
an important part in supporting local development and helps us 
meet the different customer needs more effectively.
Ensuring stability and profitability therefore constitutes a core ac-
tion area of the  Volks wa gen Group – providing a basis for sustaina-
ble growth and investment in the future. With this in mind we have 
put in place a future-oriented efficiency program called Future 
Tracks. We are targeting further profitable growth so as to be con-
tinuously in a position to invest in the future of the  Volks wa gen 
Group. By applying intelligent innovations and technologies, we 
are aiming for global leadership in customer satisfaction and qual-
ity. However, the Group’s sustainable success also depends on how 
promptly we identify risks and opportunities and how consistently 
we comply with legislation, ethical principles and self-imposed ob-
ligations. Consequently, far-sighted risk management and a strin-
gent compliance organization are of decisive importance for us. We 
not only apply high standards to our own activities but also demand 
compliance with these standards from our suppliers. 
Market Developments
In view of the worldwide patterns of demand for cars and commer-
cial vehicles, the growth markets of Asia, South America and Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe are particularly important to the 
 Volks wa gen Group. These markets offer great potential, although 
in some countries in these regions the background conditions 
present obstacles to growing our local unit sales. In Russia, for ex-
ample, the political crisis and its economic consequences have put 
a brake on market growth. Nevertheless, Russia has the potential 
to become one of the world’s largest automobile markets. The US 
vehicle market again showed tangible growth in 2014, thanks to 
the positive development of the economy and attractive financing 
conditions. However, given that the crisis-led backlog in replace-
ment demand has largely been met, market growth now looks set 
to slow down. In Brazil the economic situation worsened following 
a promising start to the reporting period, with a negative impact 
on the vehicle market. Rising inflation and interest rates meant 
that vehicles  became more expensive. To strengthen our competi-
tive position here, we offer models that have been developed spe-
cifically for the Brazilian market and are manufactured locally, 
including the Gol and the Fox. China, the largest market in the 
Asia-Pacific region, continued to grow in the reporting period. 
Here, demand for motor vehicles will continue to rise in the com-
ing years, driven by the growing need for personal mobility. 
Growth rates looks set slow down, however, and will likely shift 
from the major cities on the coast to the inland regions.

IT’S NOT ABOUT  
GROWTH AT ALL COSTS. 
The  Volks wa gen Group keeps on growing, year after year. In 2014, for the first time ever we sold more 
than 10 million vehicles. That brought us closer to our corporate goal of being the world’s leading 
 automaker by 2018. But unit sales are not the only measure of success; it’s also about profitability, 
customer satisfaction and sustainability.

Policies and Guidelines
Our business activities are governed by our policies and the 
strategic goals of the Group: 
 > The  Volks wa gen Group corporate values: Defined in 2002, 
these lay the foundations for our activities (see page 20). 
 > The  Volks wa gen Group Code of Conduct: Introduced in 2010, 
the Group-wide Code of Conduct (see page 46) must also be 
 respected by our business partners. 
 > The  Volks wa gen Group requirements regarding sustaina­
bility in its relationships with business partners (Code of 
Conduct for business partners): Originally defined in 2006, 
the requirements were revised in 2013. They set out the Group’s 
 expectations concerning its business partners’ conduct with 
 regard to central environmental and social standards. 
 18
 >  Policy on Taxes and Duties: Drawn up in 2014, this describes 
our Group-wide approach to the topic of tax and duties. 
 19
 >  Quality Policy: In 2008 the  Volks wa gen brand issued a Quality 
Policy which covers product quality, process quality, customer 
satisfaction and on-time delivery. Similar policies are in force at 
the other Group brands.
Modular Strategy
One key instrument in the pursuit of our economic goals is the 
Modular Transverse Matrix, also known by its German abbrevia-
tion MQB. The MQB offers a uniform technical framework for 
 virtually all future  Volks wa gen Group vehicles with a transverse 
engine. It enables us to use identical components in different 
models, reducing both development costs and production times. 
By enabling the replacement of individual components, the MQB 
helps us respond rapidly to changing customer wishes. In the long 
term it can be used by multiple Group brands to build different cat-
egories of vehicle on one and the same production line. In the 
event of radical changes in the marketplace, the MQB can thus 
help avoid excess capacities and misallocation of resources. In 
 addition to conventional gasoline and diesel engines, the MQB 
also gives us the opportunity to integrate alternative powertrains, 
such as gas, hybrid, or electric drives. In view of the varied and 
changing CO2 regulation scenario worldwide, this represents an 
invaluable added measure of flexibility. New driver assistance 
systems such as road sign or pedestrian recognition, the traffic 
jam assistant or Emergency Assist can also be installed with the 
MQB. The MQB was introduced at the  Volks wa gen, Audi, SEAT 
and ŠKODA brands in 2012 and by 2014 more than 2.5 million 
 vehicles had been built on this basis. Additional models based on 
the MQB in 2014 included the Audi A3 e-tron•, the  Volks wa gen 
Passat• and Passat Estate•, and the Golf models Golf Estate CNG•, 
Golf GTE•, e-Golf• and the Golf Sportsvan•. The MQB’s counter-
part on the production side is the Modular Production Matrix 
(MPB), which mandates equipment-related standards for the en-
tire production process. 
Quality Assurance
The  Volks wa gen Group pursues a uniform quality strategy world-
wide. The growing number of production locations and market-
specific model variants leaves quality assurance – from product 
development to customer service – facing major challenges. In 
 order to live up to our high quality standards worldwide, quality 
assurance activities are governed by a central body at crossbrand 
level. This ensures a high degree of organizational and thematic 
standardization. The Group networks the brands and regions and 
controls the overarching processes in this context. Responsibility 
for product quality lies with the respective markets and regions. 
Across all locations and over the entire product life cycle, some 
16,000 employees are involved in quality processes, helping to 
safeguard our growth by avoiding and eliminating errors.

DRIVING & 
 PARKING
Automated Driving
For the past 25 years, the  Volks wa gen Group has been developing 
a variety of automated driving concepts, starting with driver 
 assistance systems that enhance road safety by providing optimal 
driver support, while also reducing driver errors. In the future 
however, the main focus of development work will be on commu-
nication-based vehicle speed control, designed to improve over-
all traffic flow – which at the same time means reduced energy 
consumption.
Audi is performing pioneering work in the field of automated driv-
ing. From Audi Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go function to 
traffic sign recognition, driver assistance systems designed to 
ease the load on the driver are already available across the entire 
Audi model line-up. Later this decade, the brand will also intro-
duce newly developed “piloted driving” technologies. In certain 
situations, such as driving in heavy, stop-go traffic or parking, 
these systems can take complete control of the vehicle – if the driv-
er wishes. Audi, which became the world’s first carmaker to re-
ceive a license to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in the 
US state of Nevada in 2013, will open a new chapter in driver assis-
tance systems in 2015 with the launch of the new Audi Q7•, featur-
ing solutions such as the Predictive Efficiency Assistant, the Trail-
er Assistant and Adaptive Cruise Control including the Congestion 
Assistant. Other Group brands are developing similar concepts. 
For example, in 2012 the  Volks wa gen brand presented its Tempo-
rary Auto Pilot system, for autonomous driving on motorways at 
speeds of up to 130 km/h. A production version of this system could 
be ready in the near future.
In the commercial vehicle sector too, intelligent electronic assis-
tance systems are an important development focus. Scania already 
offers driver assistance systems that support truck drivers in their 
day-to-day work, strengthen safety and reduce fuel consumption. 
Recent examples include the autonomous emergency braking sys-
tem, which was launched in 2013 and became a mandatory re-
quirement in 2014. This system automatically brakes the vehicle 
combination if an obstruction on the road is detected and the driv-
er fails to react. The next generation of intelligent electronic assis-
tance systems, now being developed at Scania, offers various au-
tonomous driving capabilities to enhance efficiency and safety, 
using a range of sensor technologies such as cameras, radar and 
ultrasound to help guide the vehicle. These systems are now being 
implemented for the mining industry. In parallel, Scania is devel-
oping systems for autonomous high-speed vehicle platooning on 
motorways, a technology that offers promising potential, in par-
ticular for reducing fuel consumption. Scania is currently leading 
the European Union’s COMPANION research project, which is 
exploring the potential of vehicle platooning and assessing what 
legislative changes would be required to implement it.
 V  Intelligent vehicles will mean fewer 
accidents, fewer traffic jams and less 
congestion.
According to the UN Convention on Road Traffic, as amended in 
2014, automated systems are now permissible as long as they can 
be overridden or switched off by the driver at any time. Even here, 
though, change could be on the way. Computers are now capable of 
driving more safely than distracted or tired drivers, and their re-
actions are quicker and more precise. As well as reducing acci-
dents, the benefits of intelligent vehicles also include less conges-
tion and reduced driving stress. The  Volks wa gen Group’s work on 
these highly complex technologies is closely focused on meeting 
the evolving needs of modern society.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY
 Volks wa gen takes a comprehensive view of product responsibility. 
Along with core aspects of quality and both active and passive vehi-
cle safety, the strategic framework for our product development 
work is provided by three action areas from the  Volks wa gen 
Group’s environmental management system – resource conserva-
tion, climate protection and healthcare. We aim to help our cus-
tomers experience comprehensive road safety and offer them a 
wide range of efficient, affordable and practical powertrain tech-
nologies.
 V  “MOST INNOVATIVE CARMAKER” AWARD
In 2014,  Volks wa gen’s technical innovations again impressed the 
German Center of Automotive Management (CAM). For the 
fourth time in succession, CAM awarded the  Volks wa gen Group 
its AutomotiveINNOVATIONS Award in the category “Most inno-
vative carmaker” as well as in the categories “Conventional Pow-
ertrains”, “Alternative Powertrains” and “Networked Vehicle” as 
the world’s best manufacturer. The jury explained its choice by 
stating that with 229 innovations and an innovation rating of 
186 points,  Volks wa gen had charted “the highest score ever re-
corded by a single Group” as well as demonstrating “a very high 
level of technological competence and a broad portfolio of inno-
vative brands”. The highlights given special mention were the 
e-up!• and the e-Golf•, highly economical electric cars that went 
into series production in the period covered by the award. The 
most impressive innovations singled out were the Porsche Pan-
amera S E-Hybrid3• as the first luxury class plug-in hybrid and 
the 918 Spyder Plug-in-Hybrid• as the world’s most powerful 
plug-in hybrid model.
Innovation Management
Between now and 2019,  Volks wa gen is set to invest the enormous 
sum of €85.6 billion in new models, environmentally compatible 
drive technologies and optimized production processes. These in-
vestments are essential to prepare us for global challenges, regu-
latory requirements and new customer wishes, and to extend our 
innovation and technology leadership. At the same time we are 
aiming to step up the efficiency of our crossbrand innovation man-
agement as well as networking the development processes at our 
brands. By creating overarching technology networks we avoid 
parallel developments, generate efficient technology transfer and 
can simultaneously reduce our development costs. In order to offer 
each customer a product that is not only tailored to their needs but 
also environmentally compatible, we are driving forward the 
 development of solutions that range from highly efficient, eco- 
friendly diesel, gasoline and natural gas engines to innovative 
 hybrid drive systems and all-electric vehicles. The decisive factor 
for the attainment of our corporate goals is our technological and 
commercial performance, which is reflected not least in our Fuel & 
Powertrain Strategy (see pages 91 – 92).
Our innovations are not restricted to efficient powertrains and 
lightweight design. We see mobility as a holistic concept and bun-
dle our activities here under the heading of “Intelligent Mobility”. 
By this we mean greater efficiency, more networking and greater 
flexibility, or in other words an increase in safe, comfortable and 
environmentally compatible mobility (see page 86). With the 
 Volks wa gen Data Lab, founded in Munich in 2014, we are laying 
the foundations for new digital offerings involving the processing 
and analysis of large volumes of data. Here, fledgling start-ups 
and leading scientific institutes join forces with experts from our 
specialist departments to come up with new ideas and develop-
software prototypes for the Group.
 V COMPREHENSIVE ROAD SAFETY – ŠKODA STYLE
On their market launch, all seven of the ŠKODA brand’s model series 
scored the top 5-star rating in the respected Euro NCAP crash test. 
The latest member of the product line-up to receive 5 stars was the 
new ŠKODA Fabia• in November 2014. This top rating across the 
board documents the high level of safety that ŠKODA vehicles rep-
resent and is the result of comprehensive efforts aimed at maxi-
mum active and passive safety. To this end, the specialists in the 
Technical Development department design innovative assistance 
systems as well as perfectly coordinated occupant retention sys-
tems, leading-edge chassis technology, high-performance lighting 
systems and optimized bodywork structures. In addition, in the 
context of its social responsibility, the company commits to a varie-
ty of initiatives designed to enhance road safety.

ECONOMY
Safe Vehicles and Road Safety
As an automaker we believe we have a responsibility to protect all 
road users to the best of our ability. All of our activities in this 
 respect are geared to Vision Zero, which is to say zero fatalities or 
severe injuries in and due to vehicles manufactured by the 
 Volks wa gen Group. We are working to prevent accidents hap-
pening in the first place. The Group’s accident research depart-
ments play a pivotal role in this work, reconstructing and evalu-
ating accidents in order to obtain information that will help 
boost future vehicle safety – findings that feed directly into our 
vehicle development activities, leading to new and user-oriented 
innovations. Today, a whole raft of assistance systems help driv-
ers defuse hazardous situations well in advance. Intelligent 
driver assistance systems help them identify risks faster or avoid 
dangerous situations from the outset. These include ACC cruise 
control with Automatic Distance Control, the lane-keeping as-
sistant Lane Assist, or the lane-changing assistant Side Assist, 
as well as the Emergency Assist system (introduced in the Passat 
in November 2014), along with many other driver assistance and 
safety systems. The aim in the future is to provide support when 
braking and taking evasive action to avoid collisions and provide 
an even higher level of safety. These active safety systems are 
backed up by optimally designed passive safety technology, for 
example in the shape of highly deformation-resistant passenger 
cells, defined front and rear crumple zones and crash-opti-
mized interior design. 
 V  We will only retain satisfied  
customers if our products exceed their 
expectations.
The activities of Group Research include drawing up feasibility stud-
ies for future automated driving and safety functions. For instance, 
the Autopilot function uses sensors to scan the vehicle’s environ-
ment, identifies and interprets the dynamic situation and computes 
the appropriate maneuvers. Equipped with this technology, the ve-
hicle can drive itself autonomously and safely in parking garages 
and car parks, and can subsequently drive to a predefined pick-up 
point to await the driver’s return. In urban environments the system 
supports the driver in choosing an appropriate speed and can assist 
with lateral guidance in narrow spaces. On major roads and motor-
ways the system is capable of driving autonomously, taking full con-
trol of longitudinal and lateral guidance, so that drivers can even 
take their hands off the wheel. If the system then encounters a safe-
ty-critical situation, it helps with the braking and evasive action, 
thereby reducing the severity of an accident or, in the best-case sce-
nario, preventing it entirely. Despite all of these sophisticated assis-
tance systems, however, the driver remains responsible for control 
of the vehicle. Assuring his or her safety – and the safety of all other 
road users – is the primary goal of all assistance systems. 
Product Safety
Maintaining the highest standards of product safety is of funda-
mental importance to the Group and its brands. That is why we 
attach such importance to painstaking quality assurance along 
the entire value chain, from purchasing right through to sales. 
Standardized processes, which are continuously optimized, pro-
vide a benchmark in all parts of the value chain. As part of our 
risk management activities we also enforce the highest possible 
quality standards throughout the value chain. Because we will 
only retain satisfied customers if our products exceed their ex-
pectations.

Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is of paramount importance for all 
 Volks wa gen Group brands. We monitor customer satisfaction 
 using standardized performance indicators which are the same 
for all brands and include brand image, desirability, future pur-
chase consideration, product quality and brand communication 
awareness. To ensure the targeted management of value-creating 
measures for the brands, we have established a “Group KPI” plat-
form that can be accessed by all of the brands. Along with core in-
dicators such as unit sales growth or customer loyalty, here the 
brands can also generate their own specific indicators to enable 
them to track customer satisfaction on an ongoing basis.
Around the world and across all Group brands satisfaction 
 studies are carried out through which we ensure that due atten-
tion is paid to customer wishes and that we constantly improve 
our product and process quality. These studies focus on three 
areas: product, service and dealerships. Over the years we have 
been able to achieve a constant improvement in the Group’s 
 average rating. Consequently, we believe we are on track to reach 
our corporate goal of leading the field in terms of customer 
 satisfaction.
In 2014 the individual brands also turned in a very good perfor-
mance in terms of customer satisfaction: in the European market 
all of the Group’s brands topped the rankings ahead of their re-
spective competitors and were also able to improve their customer 
satisfaction ratings compared to the previous year. Porsche in par-
ticular merits special mention in this respect. In China too there 
were very positive developments to report, with all Group brands 
improving on their performance of the previous year.  Volks wa gen, 
ŠKODA and Audi led the field in terms of customer satisfaction, 
ahead of their respective competitors.

In the USA, meanwhile,  Volks wa gen ranked among the top three 
while Audi topped the rankings with a better customer satisfaction

mid-table but were able to improve on their score from the previ-
ous year. 
Information and Labeling
As product manufacturers, all companies in the  Volks wa gen 
Group are obliged to suitably inform the users of their products 
about dangers that can ensue even during correct operation or 
foreseeable misuse of the product and warn them accordingly. 
The Group companies meet these requirements through in-
struction manuals and in individual cases through warning 
stickers in the vehicle. Since December 1, 2011, it has been 
mandatory for all new cars in Germany to be labeled with a 
weight-based efficiency label similar to the energy labeling sys-
tem used for household appliances. Efficiency classes range 
from A+ (very efficient) to G (inefficient). The label also provides 
information on fuel consumption, annual fuel costs, CO2 emis-
sions and the amount of tax payable under Germany’s CO2-
based vehicle tax. For electric vehicles, the label provides infor-
mation on electricity consumption. All Group brands use their 
websites to provide information on the fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions of their models. The fuel consumption and emis-
sion figures for all models referred to in this report can be found 
on page 144 . The  Volks wa gen and Audi brands also publish 
 Environmental Commendations (see pages 94 – 95), which 
 describe improvements in the environmental performance of 
new vehicles and technologies over their predecessors or refer-
ence models.

LOCAL VALUE ADDED
Local production in important sales markets is a core element of 
our growth strategy. Lower logistics costs, procurement prices in 
line with local market conditions, elimination of import duties 
and immunity from volatile exchange rates contribute to the com-
petitiveness of our brands. And people in the regions profit as well. 
Not only do we create skilled jobs, but our production locations at-
tract supplier firms to locate in the area, contributing to local eco-
nomic development.
Economic Benefits of Localization
The concept of localization helps us to open up new markets. We 
observe the different markets and specific customer needs and 
bring our products into line with the local requirements. Thanks 
to the MQB we have a uniform global platform on which to effi-
ciently make specific regional adaptations to our models.  In Chi-
na, for example, specially modified vehicles and models designed 
for that market form the cornerstone of our growth strategy. Today 
our product portfolio in China spans all segments, from compact 
cars to luxury sports cars. And new vehicle categories such as SUVs 
were incorporated into local production activities at an early date. 
Contributing to Regional Development
Through our focus on the localization of value added, we create 
jobs in our production locations and generate significant up-
stream and downstream employment effects at supplier compa-
nies, service operations and other local contractors. In Pune 
 (India) for example, since the  Volks wa gen location was set up 69 
new supplier companies have been founded, creating some 13,500 
 direct and indirect jobs. The decision in 2014 to produce a new SUV 
at the Chattanooga location (USA) also created 2,000  additional 
jobs at the  Volks wa gen plant and added jobs at local suppliers. And 
thanks to our sustainable supplier development efforts in Kaluga 
(Russia), at the end of 2014 our plant there was working with a 
 total of 60 suppliers on the locally produced models. Together with 
our joint venture partners, we are set to invest a total of €18.2 bil-
lion in new locations and products in China from 2014 to 2018 – 
the largest investment program in the history of the Chinese auto-
mobile industry. Here the Group’s investments take account of 
the  Chinese government’s efforts to continue growing and devel-
oping the economy in the western part of the country.
At our locations we also support a large number of projects which 
foster social development, the arts, education and nature conser-
vation and promote regional economic development (see pages 
76 – 77).

 V  CONTRIBUTING TO THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION
Around the world, the shift toward cleaner energy generation sys-
tems is associated with high investment costs. However, society 
and local regions can expect to reap an enormous dividend. With 
our products, we are aiming to play a part in integrating all the nec-
essary technologies into an efficient, comprehensive system. For 
example, the natural gas engines developed by MAN Diesel & Turbo 
for combined heat and power (CHP) plants are a key component in 
decentralized energy generation. And the Audi e-gas project maps 
out ways to efficiently store large quantities of wind or solar energy 
regardless of location (see page 92). For further information, see our 
brochure on cleaner energy.

SUVS: 
WHERE EMOTION MEETS REASON?
In no other segment has demand risen so steeply in recent years as in the category of sport­utility vehicles 
or SUVs. The ideal view of the road and a high degree of comfort and safety make these off­roaders the ideal 
 everyday companion for customers. But on account of their size and the associated higher level of fuel 
 consumption, these models often come in for criticism from the media or environmental organizations as 
gas  guzzlers and climate killers. 
Above all, the expansion of the worldwide SUV market as the 
segment with the fastest relative growth reveals the scale of the 
challenges that every automaker faces in respect of compliance 
with CO2 emissions regulations. Innovations, above all in the 
fields of lightweight design, aerodynamics and – in particular – 
electrification are in greater demand now than ever before.
Electrification, however, needs to become more widespread if 
this type of drive is to become accepted as “normal”. This will 
also call for reduced cost structures, leading to marked reduc-
tions in the  surcharges for electric drive and thus to the kind of 
attractive prices that are necessary. On the way to this goal we 
have already launched models including the Golf GTE•, e-up!•, 
eGolf•, A3 e-tron• and Cayenne S E-Hybrid•. Electrified concept 
vehicles such as the Cross Coupé GTE or the Sport Coupé Concept 
GTE signpost the way forward here. The  Volks wa gen Group 
 already has the highest proportion of electrified models in its 
product portfolio, offering a combination of fun at the wheel 
and environmentally compatible consumption, driving the more 
widespread acceptance of electric mobility, and helping sustain-
able mobility concepts to make a breakthrough.
Innovations in the fields of lightweight design and aerody-
namics will enable us to achieve further increases in efficien-
cy. Compared to their predecessors, the latest versions of the 
 Volks wa gen Touareg• and the Audi Q7• are far lighter. Further 
savings are achieved through the ongoing enhancement of 
our energy-efficient engines, so that the Touareg• consumes 
less than 10 liters per 100 kilometers and the Tiguan• just 5.3 
liters.
In this way, the  Volks wa gen Group manages to resolve apparent-
ly contradictory aspirations such as compliance with climate 
 protection goals on the one hand and responding to the simulta-
neous rise in individual customer requirements on the other, 
while making an express commitment to fulfilling its ecological 
responsibilities, today and in the future.

Subsidies and Taxes
In 2014, for the expansion of its activities in the field of research 
and development and in the creation of new production locations 
the  Volks wa gen Group received €883 million in government 
grants related to income. 
At the same time, thanks to its localization strategy, through taxes 
and duties the  Volks wa gen Group helps ensure that state and mu-
nicipal investments in infrastructure and public welfare are pos-
sible in many parts of the world. It is our policy to pay taxes wherev-
er we add value. In 2014 we paid the worldwide tax authorities a 
total of around €4 billion in income tax. This represents a tax rate 
of 25.2% for the  Volks wa gen Group worldwide. Well over half of 
these payments were accounted for by Germany.
SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT 
 Volks wa gen Group procurement mainly purchases production 
materials, services and capex centrally. In the reporting period, 
the purchasing volume – including the Chinese joint venture 
 companies – increased by 7.7% to €145.5 billion. Suppliers in 
 Germany accounted for a share of 36.1%.  
Concept and Organization
To ensure that flows of goods and services remain stable and effi-
cient, in 2006 the  Volks wa gen Group formulated its Sustainability 
in Supplier Relations concept and has continued to refine it ever 
since. Together with traditional priorities such as quality, price and 
delivery times, the concept had been thoroughly integrated in our 
procurement process. To us, applying and monitoring sustainabil-
ity standards in the supply chain is above all a matter of minimizing 
risk – preventing potential supply shortages and damage to our rep-
utation and ensuring that the quality of the procured supplies and 
services remains consistent. Both the Group and its suppliers profit 
from the long-term supplier relationships which result. 
The concept, which is based on three main pillars, aims to mini-
mize or prevent negative social, environmental and financial 
 impacts along our supply chain:
 > An early warning system that identifies and minimizes risks 
along the supply chain.
 > Contractually mandated integration of the sustainability stand-
ards in the procurement process. These must be acknowledged 
by all suppliers before submitting a quotation on the Group Busi-
ness Platform. Otherwise it is not possible to submit a quotation.
 > Supplier monitoring and development.
We regularly benchmark the effectiveness of our concept against 
other companies and intensively analyze the results of sustaina-
bility ratings. This allows us to gain valuable insights for continu-
ing optimization and development.
In recent years we have systematically extended the Sustainability 
in Supplier Relations concept to all of the Group’s brands. In 2014 
specific elements were still being rolled out at the Porsche, MAN 
and Scania brands. 
We continuously train employees and raise their awareness to en-
sure that the concept is further anchored within the Company. 
Consequently, the concept is an established part of the qualifica-
tion program at the procurement academies run by the individual 
locations. In addition, cross-functional training courses were 
again held in 2014. In the reporting year, more than 900 purchas-
ing staff received training in Sustainability in Supplier Relations. 
To reinforce the communication of our concept internally and ex-
ternally, in 2014 we also published a brochure and made it availa-
ble on the Group Business Platform.

Risk Analysis
The  Volks wa gen Group subjects all potential new business part-
ners and suppliers to an integrity check (Business Partner Check). 
Our aim is to reduce the risk of a relationship that could adversely 
affect the Group and its business by carefully examining the social 
integrity of the potential supplier. So suppliers who register on the 
Group Business Platform for the first time are subjected to the 
Business Partner Check before onboarding.
The  Volks wa gen Group uses a country risk analysis to obtain a 
clearer picture of social, environmental and human-rights risks 
in the region where potential suppliers operate before entering 
into negotiations with them. This takes both third-party informa-
tion and in-house empirical data into account. The analysis has 
shown that there is an increased risk of non-compliance with our 
sustainability requirements in Brazil, India, China, Mexico and 
Russia. For this reason, in our supplier development activities we 
place a particular focus on these countries. To identify current 
 developments as well as long-term structural challenges in each 
country, we rely on the ongoing exchange of information between 
the brands and the regions at the regular meetings and video con-
ferences held by the Sustainability Procurement Network.

 V PROCUREMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
The risk management system in the procurement sector constantly 
monitors and analyzes the financial stability of our suppliers. A 
suite of different measures help to largely eliminate supply risks 
due to the failure of suppliers. In addition, suitable measures are 
 applied to minimize the financial effects of crises and insolvencies 
in the supply chain. 
In 2013 we signed up to the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EI-TI), which is supported by governments, NGOs, in-
vestors and businesses. The EITI aims to combat corruption by 
making payment flows related to raw materials transparent. We 
also demonstrate our commitment to more transparency in the 
supply chain as a standing member of the UN Global Compact 
 Advisory Group on Supply Chain Sustainability. The  Volks wa gen 
Group supports the efforts of the European Commission to sup-
press the funding of armed conflicts through the raw materials 
trade. We play an active part in defining the position of the German 
and European industry associations, advocating the application of 
voluntary self-certification in the upstream segment of the supply 
chain.

Sustainability Requirements and Integration
Our supplier relations are based on the “ Volks wa gen Group re-
quirements regarding sustainability in its relationships with busi-
ness partners (Code of Conduct for Business Partners)”, which ap-
ply across the Group (see page 46). They formulate our expectations 
for our business partners’ conduct with regard to central environ-
mental and social standards. Among other things, they are based 
on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International 
Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Devel-
opment and the relevant conventions of the International Labour 
Organization. These principles are supplemented by  Volks wa gen’s 
Environmental Policy, the environment targets and regulations 
derived from it, the Group’s Quality Policy and the  Volks wa gen 
Declaration on Social Rights. 
Before submitting a quotation, the supplier must acknowledge the 
sustainability requirements; this acknowledgement must be re-
peated every 12 months. The requirements have been contractual-
ly integrated since November 2013 for all suppliers to General Pro-
curement, and since January 2014 for all suppliers of production 
materials as well. The requirements apply to all outsourced goods 
and services worldwide. We also expect our tier 1 suppliers to pass 
these requirements on to their own suppliers. 
In addition,  Volks wa gen requires its main suppliers to put in place 
a certified environmental management system in accordance with 
ISO 14001 and/or EMAS. Such systems have been verified and 
documented at 87% of our main suppliers. As part of the EMAS 
and ISO 14001 environmental certification and auditing at the 
 Volks wa gen AG locations, the contractors and suppliers who work 
on the plant grounds and have an environmental impact are also 
subject to regular monitoring. 
In the course of the business process, all suppliers are required to 
complete our sustainability questionnaire and to document their 
activities in the areas of environmental protection and social 
standards. By December 31, 2014, 15,405 Group suppliers had re-
turned the questionnaire. In terms of procurement volume that 
equates to 87%.
Supplier Development and Qualification
In the interests of continuing supplier development, in the course 
of our business relations we make an electronic learning 
(E-Learning) module on sustainability available to all suppliers in 
all of the languages of the defined risk markets. After completing 
this task, the supplier has to perform a final test. By the end of 
2014, 14,457 suppliers had completed the E-Learning module, 
which equates to 71% of procurement expenditures. The tool is 
made available to the supplier’s workforce as well as to employees 
of  Volks wa gen AG Procurement for qualification purposes. 
In addition to this E-Learning format, we also conduct region- and 
topic-specific sustainability training courses and workshops with 
our suppliers. In the reporting period, courses were held in coun-
tries including Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Poland. 
In addition, as part of the European Automotive Working Group on 
Supply Chain Sustainability, a supply chain forum took place in 
Istanbul in November 2014. In an intensive dialogue, suppliers 
and manufacturers discussed important challenges and solutions 
with the aim of improving sustainability along the  supply chain. 
The event spotlighted social rights. Through these diverse meas-
ures, in 2014 we were able to qualify more than 900 suppliers.
Supplier Monitoring and Audits
The  Volks wa gen Group uses an internal system for sustainable sup-
ply chain management. It provides supplier-specific sustainability 
information, enabling the comprehensive analysis of suppliers. If 
there is reason to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their suppliers are 
failing to comply with our sustainability requirements, we ask the 
party concerned for a written statement using a standardized report 
(6D Report). Based on the six points in the report, they can describe 
the status quo and any remedial measures. If the  answers prove 
 unsatisfactory, we take further appropriate steps, such as the exami-
nation of documents, visits to the supplier’s premises or other cus-
tomized supplier development activities. These measures are coordi-
nated by an ad-hoc expert team in Wolfsburg together with the expert 
teams from the relevant brands and regions. Depending on the

 situation, experts from specialist areas such as Occupational Health 
and Safety or Personnel Management may also be called in. Specific 
improvement measures were agreed with all such suppliers. 
In 2014, for example, an unannounced visit to a supplier uncov-
ered non-compliance with occupational safety requirements. 
 Remedial measures were defined with the supplier on the spot, 
including the correct installation of emergency exit signs and 
fire-extinguishing equipment. The successful implementation 
of these measures by the supplier represented a sustainable 
 improvement in working conditions for the supplier’s employees.
 V  Through fair dialogue in a spirit of 
partnership and through supplier 
 development we create sustainability in 
supplier relations.
The focus throughout all process steps and measures is on fair 
 dialogue in a spirit of partnership and on development of the sup-
plier in the interests of sustainable collaboration. At the same 
time, the  Volks wa gen Group reserves the right to have compliance 
with the sustainability requirements verified by inhouse experts 
or by an external audit at the supplier’s premises during regular 
business hours. In the event of non-compliance with our sustaina-
bility  requirements we will terminate business relations, particu-
larly if the supplier shows no interest in improvement. No such 
case occurred during the reporting period.
The internal and external point of contact for suspected cases of 
non-compliance with our sustainability requirements, particu-
larly where violations of human rights in the supply chain are con-
cerned, is the email address: sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com. 
In addition, employees and external parties can address possible 
cases of non-compliance via the  Volks wa gen Group’s national and

COMPLIANCE
In the long term, a company can only be successful if it acts with 
integrity, complies with statutory provisions worldwide and stands 
by its voluntary undertakings and ethical principles even when 
this is the harder choice. Our Compliance organization supports 
this approach. 
We adopt a preventive compliance approach and foster a corporate 
culture that stops potential breaches before they occur. The Inter-
nal Audit, Security, Personnel Management and Legal depart-
ments at Group level are responsible for the necessary investiga-
tive measures and responses. The guidelines laid down in the 
 Volks wa gen Group’s Code of Conduct are of essential importance 
here. These have been communicated and can be accessed by all 
Group employees via the  Volks wa gen portal and on the Internet 
pages of the  Volks wa gen Group.

Officers in the Group companies. Employees in a total of 66 coun-
tries work for the Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) organi-
zation. Networking of the organization is promoted by measures 
including regional workshops. 
 V SETTING THE TONE
“Compliance with regulations on anti-corruption and competition 
law is essential for all employees worldwide, irrespective of the 
brand or company. A clear understanding of Compliance-related 
 requirements provides security for all concerned. The sustained 
 success of our company can only be guaranteed if we comply with 
the applicable laws and rules.” Christian Klingler, Member of the 
Board of Management of  Volks wa gen AG responsible for Sales and 
Marketing, May 2014.
Integrated Governance, Risk & Compliance Approach
Compliance is a key element of the  Volks wa gen Group’s Govern-
ance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) organization. Potential compli-
ance risks are identified and assessed by the standard GRC pro-
cess that is in place across the Group. As a result, in the reporting 
year more than 2,500 assessments of potential compliance risks 
and the relevant remedial measures were reported by over 90 com-
panies; more than 550 tests were staged within the companies to 
evaluate the effectiveness of these measures. Risk assessments are 
drawn up in particular on the topics of active and passive corrup-
tion, conflicts of interest, competition law and antitrust law. Based 
on the findings, preventive measures are drawn up and the appro-
priate compliance programs defined. During the selection pro-
cess for new production locations, Group Production assesses the 
locations not least with a view to potential corruption risks.
Expansion of Compliance in 2014 
In 2014 the compliance agenda focused on the continuing expan-
sion of the GRC organization, tightening compliance standards 
for the sales organization, international money-laundering pre-
vention, and the handling of contracts for work or services. In ad-
dition, based on the “ Volks wa gen Group requirements regarding 
sustainability in its relationships with business partners” (Code of 
Conduct for Business Partners), supplier awareness of topics in-
cluding human rights was increased. Business partners of the

ance, since 2010 all new employment contracts entered into be-
tween  Volks wa gen AG on the one part and both management staff 
and employees covered by collective agreements on the other have 
included a reference to the Code of Conduct and the obligation to 
comply with it. Completion of the online training module on the 
Code of Conduct is mandatory for all new employees. As of 2014, 
compliance with the Code of Conduct is one factor in calculating 
the variable, performance-based pay component. 
Prevention through Information
By means of appropriate preventive measures integrated in our 
existing management system, we foster compliance with the rules 
within our organization and sharpen our employees’ awareness. 
However, we are also aware that the risk of individual misconduct 
can never be completely eliminated. To raise employee awareness 
of compliance-related issues we use both traditional communi-

stands, and electronic media such as intranet portals, apps, blogs, 
audio-podcasts and online newsletters and guidelines. For exam-
ple, our Anti-Corruption Guidelines are available to all employees,

Checks, Audits, Sanctions and Data Protection
Group Internal Audit regularly and systematically reviews pro-
cesses within the Company, using approaches such as the interna-
tionally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk Management frame-
work. It also carries out random checks irrespective of any 
suspicion of non-compliance and investigates whenever breaches 
are actually suspected.
The worldwide ombudsman system in place since 2006 can be used to 
confidentially report corruption, fraudulent activities, or other seri-
ous irregularities (such as human rights violations or ethical miscon-
duct) in ten different languages to two external lawyers appointed by 
the Group. Naturally, the people providing the information need not 
fear being punished by the Company for doing so. As of December 
2014, there is also the option of using an additional online channel to 
communicate with the ombudsmen. A technically secure digital mail-
box allows suspected breaches to be reported – anonymously, if so 
 desired. In 2014, the ombudsmen passed on 51 reports by people – 
whose details remained confidential if requested – to the  Volks wa gen 
Group’s Anti-Corruption Officer, the Head of Group Internal Audit. In 
addition, the Anti-Corruption Officer received information on a fur-
ther 89 cases directly. One case was identified by the person report-
ing it as a possible human rights violation. During local internal 
 audits of the brands and Group companies, 365 reports of suspected 
fraud were submitted. All information is followed up. All breaches 
of the law or internal regulations are appropriately punished. In 
2014 action was taken against a total of 132 employees across the 
 Volks wa gen Group as a result of findings of investigations based on 
information received. In 72 of these cases worldwide, the employee’s 
contract was terminated. Moreover, during the reporting year, 16 
contracts with business partners were terminated or not renewed 
 because of infringements related to corruption.

terms of risks which, from the point of view of the auditors, are 
relevant to the audit. The topics with the highest risk levels are 
integrated into the auditing programs. In 2014 a total of 1,723 
audits were conducted at 304 companies. Among other things, 
the audits also examine internal control mechanisms for the 
prevention of corruption (four-eye principle, segregation of 
functions), the existence of compliance guidelines and preven-
tive measures.
Another aspect of the audit function is advising the specialist areas 
of the  Volks wa gen Group. In particular, this helps define process-
es and ensures they are designed in compliance with internal 
standards and can be applied worldwide.
In addition, Group Internal Audit has set up a Continuous Monitor-
ing unit. It is tasked not least with supporting the effectiveness of 
the internal control system, based on structured data analysis of 
the financial systems. This allows potential weak spots to be dis-
covered quickly, preventing major damage from occurring.
Data protection, i.e. ensuring the privacy of personal data, is an 
important corporate principle. With this in mind, the data protec-
tion organization in the  Volks wa gen Group is continuously being 
enhanced and progressively networked. It is active on three levels: 
Group (Group data protection office), brand (brand spokesperson 
for data protection), and Group companies (data protection of-
ficers or contacts).
The aim of the Group-wide data protection organization is to pro-
vide a uniformly high level of protection for personal data within 
the  Volks wa gen Group. In addition, the organization provides a 
basis for the standardization and regular adaptation of data pro-
tection requirements in the Group, for example in the cases of 
 networked vehicles and Group-wide IT systems.
Further information on compliance at the  Volks wa gen Group can 
be found in the 2014 Annual Report.

RATINGS AND INDEXES
The  Volks wa gen Group can point to a growing number of investors 
who take sustainability criteria into account. These include some 
100 European mutual funds that apply social and ecological crite-
ria. One of the largest institutional investors in Europe, the state 
Norwegian pension fund, invested more than €5.5 million in the 
 Volks wa gen Group. These investment decisions are influenced by 
positive sustainability assessments from ratings agencies and an-
alysts. 
Top Scores for Group and Brands
In 2014 the  Volks wa gen Group earned very good scores in the most 
important international ratings and relevant indexes, holding a 
leading position in its sector. In the sustainability ratings pub-
lished by RobecoSAM, the Group was listed in both the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index World and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
Europe, receiving 88 points out of 100. However, we no longer held 
the position of sector leader.
In the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Group was again list-
ed in both Leadership Indexes, receiving the top A rating in the 
CDP Global 500 Climate Performance Leadership Index and 99 
points out of 100 in the CDP Global 500 Climate Disclosure Lead-
ership Index.
As in the previous year, MAN was the only German company from 
the mechanical engineering sector listed in the Dow Jones Sus-
tainability Index World and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
Europe. The CDP awarded MAN its highest ratings in the “Indus-
trials” sector: 97 out of a possible 100 points in the Climate Disclo-
sure Leadership Index and an A rating in the Climate Performance 
Leadership Index.
oekom research, a rating agency which analyzes sustainable in-
vestments, rated the  Volks wa gen Group B- on a twelve-step scale 
from A+ to D-. Both the Group and Scania were awarded Prime sta-
tus, meaning they are recommended as sustainable investments. 
oekom research rates the environmental and social responsibility 
performance of companies using more than 100 criteria selected 
specifically for each sector.

Essay 
Digitization is increasingly shaping the world of work. 
Future analysts at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech­
nology are tracking the breathtaking pace at which 
computer technology is developing and have dubbed 
this “the Second Machine Age”. At the same time, “In­
dustry 4.0” – the way in which machines, products and 
humans will interact in future – is a major focus of 
 attention for engineers, management and IT experts, 
production specialists, trade union officials and pol­
iticians alike. They are modelling scenarios in which 
man and machine work “fist­in­glove” or in which the 
factories of tomorrow are run entirely by machines. But 
how realistic are these scenarios? And will they be a 
blessing or a curse? It is neither realistic nor desirable 
to envisage factories without human beings. However, 
anyone who visits trade fairs, research labs, top­rank­
ing universities or pilot plants at industrial companies 
can see that we are on the threshold of a further para­
digm shift in automation. The astonishing pace at 
which digitization and networking are developing has 
triggered a surge of innovation in robotics, and over the 
next few years, robots will become significantly more 
efficient and safer.
More than five million people in Germany currently 
work in industry;  Volks wa gen alone employs 120,000 
people in the production sector. So will further automa­
tion mean a renewed rise in unemployment? The an­
swer is no. Demographic trends over the next 20 years 
will actually help us safeguard jobs. Between 1955 and 
1975, a combination of Germany’s “economic miracle” 
and the baby boom produced two decades of above­ 
average population and employment growth. And the 
impact was particularly marked at  Volks wa gen: when 
demand for the Golf soared in the 1970s, we recruited 
above­average numbers of new employees. Conse­
quently, between 2015 and 2030, we will be seeing a 
disproportionate number of older employees moving 
into retirement: some 32,000 more than the long­term 
average across the  Volks wa gen Group. This gives us the 
opportunity to replace some human employees with

A MAJOR EMPLOYMENT

 robots while at the same time maintaining our existing 
recruitment levels. We could not, in any case, have 
 replaced all these retirees with young people. So in 
terms of employment policy we can afford another 
surge in automation. But why should we welcome that 
or even encourage it? There are two reasons. First, we 
want to offer good, skilled work to all our employees. To 
date we have done our utmost to make assembly­line 
jobs as ergonomic as possible, but some jobs are oner­
ous and will stay that way. It takes concentration and 
precision to feed eight drops of oil into six points on one 
camshaft after another for seven hours a day. It’s also 
monotonous and tiring – or in other words: hard work. 
Assembly work in the vehicle interior, the positioning 
of components and working overhead are further jobs 
that will not be missed when there are better ways of 
 doing them. And there are. If we have an opportunity to 
eliminate unergonomic work and to leave it to robots, 
we should do so. 
In future, there will be more skilled work available in 
our factories than there is now. Robots and networked 
production equipment need to be programmed and 
maintained, supervised and reconfigured. The qualifi­
cations of our skilled workers, Meister and engineers 
will increase; alongside mechanical and electronic 
 engineering skills, IT skills will be increasingly impor­
tant. So the advances in automation will need to be 
matched by a surge in initial and in­service training. 
And we have already begun that process. New appren­
tices starting their training with  Volks wa gen from 
2015 will be acquiring new, job­specific skills, such as 
controlling digital systems. Partnering with Germany’s 
Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Train­
ing (Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung, or BIBB), we 
have launched an initiative to develop new training 
 professions for the digital world of work. And 2015 will 
also see the rollout of a wide­ranging qualification 
 offensive at  Volks wa gen. We are equipping our employ­
ees with the fundamental digital skills they will need 
as well as with the specific technical skills for their par­
ticular “Berufsfamilie” or professional family. These 
new skills are in areas such as programming and the 
use of networked applications, online diagnostics and 
real­time analysis, networked collaboration, and the 
use of learning platforms.
The second reason for driving forward automation is 
our labor cost structure. Labor costs in Germany’s au­
tomotive industry are more than €40 per hour, com­
pared with €11 in Eastern Europe and less than €10 in 
China. No one seriously believes that we can signifi­
cantly reduce the competitive disadvantage that such 
high wage costs imply. But we would not want to do so 
either: after all, we want our skilled workers to be able 
to afford a decent car, to give just one example. So what 
does a robot cost by comparison? The robots already in 
use at  Volks wa gen cost between €3 and €6 per hour, a 
figure that includes maintenance and energy costs. 
And future generations of robots will probably cost even 
less. We have to make use of that cost advantage. And 
that is why at  Volks wa gen we are driving forward auto­
mation with moderation, using it to benefit our employ­
ees and reduce onerous work. Other sectors, too, can 
follow this path. “Industry 4.0” has the ability both to 
modernize the economy and to improve the quality of 
employment. The good news is that Germany’s demo­
graphic situation is making these changes sustainable 
in employment terms as well.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 
Securing excellent performance, generating success and enabling 
employees to share in the profits are central to the  Volks wa gen 
Group’s personnel management (PM) strategy. The key aims of 
the Group’s PM work are, therefore, qualifying our employees, 
promoting their health and fitness, and ensuring that they are 
 involved. Over recent years our employees’ hard work has made 
 Volks wa gen one of the world’s largest automakers, and that suc-
cess has gone hand in hand with rapid growth in the number of 
employees. Within just five years, the Group’s workforce has 
grown from over 399,000 to almost 593,000. The challenge is to 
integrate these new employees in the Group, qualify them and 
 enable them to add value to the business – a challenge we are meet-
ing with a comprehensive management approach. 
Alongside the ongoing internationalization of our Group struc-
ture, our response to the changes prompted by growth on this 
scale has focused on substantially expanding, upgrading and 
standardizing training right across the Group. Our approach 
is to embed learning and teaching within “Berufsfamilien” 
(professional families) in line with Germany’s dual model of 
 vocational education and training, which ensures close long-
term coordination between theory and practice. Systematic 
COMMITTED  
TO  EXCELLENCE. 
Our aim is to become the most attractive employer in the automotive sector and to achieve long-term 
success through our high-quality ‘top team’ of almost 600,000 employees. Our personnel manage-
ment policy is underpinned by the principles of fair treatment for our employees and a balance 
 between performance, pay and participation. To secure our long-term future, we want to play a part 
in shaping tomorrow’s world of work, but our commitment to the principles of fairness and responsi-
bility remains central. And that means giving our employees a share in the Company’s success and 
meeting our own corporate social responsibility.
knowledge transfer – the passing on of knowledge and experi-
ence by our own experts – is another key factor underpinning 
our success. 
The Guidelines behind the Way We Do Business
As a global undertaking with 118 production locations across 
 Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa, we have wide-ranging 
 experience of cultural differences, approaches and worldviews. 
   Volks wa gen is committed to respect, tolerance and cosmopolitan-
ism and guarantees equal opportunities and equal treatment at all 
its locations. We are also committed to sustainable development in 
the towns, cities and regions in which we operate, a commitment 
that takes many different forms. 
A range of voluntary undertakings and bilateral agreements with 
our employees and their representatives codify the fundamental 
standards, employee rights and arrangements for cooperation 
that apply across the Group:
 > The  Volks wa gen Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct came 
into operation in 2010 and creates the framework for lawful and 
ethical behavior. 
 9
 > The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations 
at  Volks wa gen (the  Volks wa gen Social Charter). In 2002, 
 Volks wa gen used this Declaration to document the basic social 
rights and principles that underpin its corporate identity. These 
social rights and principles are based on relevant International 
Labour Organization Conventions. A revised version of the 
 Social Charter was signed in 2012. 
 25
 > The  Volks wa gen Global Labour Charter. The Charter came 
into force in autumn 2009 and combines greater rights to con-
sultation with shared responsibilities. It provides for rights to 
information, consultation and codetermination for employee

Employment Trends 
These systems for formally implementing employment rights and 
guidelines are particularly important as  Volks wa gen continues to 
grow. In 2014, the workforce of the  Volks wa gen Group, including 
the Chinese joint ventures, increased by 3.5% to 592,586 as at 
 December 31, 2014. Significant factors in this increase were 
workforce expansion in growth markets, particularly in China, 
and the recruitment of skilled workers and experts in Germany 
and elsewhere. Also in 2014,   Volks wa gen AG,  Volks wa gen Sachsen 
GmbH,  Volks wa gen Financial Services AG, AUDI AG and MAN and 
Porsche in Germany took a total of 8,131 temporary employees into 
the core workforce in Germany. 
The internationalization of the  Volks wa gen Group is also reflect-
ed in a significantly higher number of international postings. 
Over the past ten years, the number of foreign service employees 
(those who are working outside their home country) within the 
 Volks wa gen Group has more than doubled. If the new brands and 
companies – Scania, MAN, Ducati, Porsche and Porsche Holding – 
are also included, the increase was even higher, at 141%. 
Group and Brands Ranked Top Employers
Our continuing success and our systematic approach to personnel 
management are also making us increasingly attractive as an 
 employer. Once again, 2014 saw the Group securing leading 
 positions in a number of employer rankings. A survey among 
 future management experts by the consultancy company trend-
ence, for example, saw the  Volks wa gen Group move from fifth to 
second most attractive European employer. A total of more than 
300,000 engineering, IT and business studies graduates from 24 
European countries took part in the trendence surveys, voting us 
most attractive employer in the automotive sector. 
In other countries,  Volks wa gen Group brands and companies 
achieved excellent rankings in a wide range of employer attractive-
ness surveys. In Germany, according to trendence, Audi was voted 
the most popular employer by engineering graduates for the fifth 
consecutive year, for example, while the  Volks wa gen Passenger 
Cars brand achieved third place among business studies graduates 
and fourth place among engineering graduates. Elsewhere in 
 Europe,  Volks wa gen-Audi España was named top employer in a 
 national survey, while automotive and mechanical engineering 
students once again voted ŠKODA the most attractive employer in 
the Czech Republic. In the UK, the Top Employers Institute award-
ed Bentley Motors Ltd. “Top Employer United Kingdom” status for 
the third consecutive year. In China, the Top Employers Institute 
voted Shanghai  Volks wa gen and FAW- Volks wa gen “Top Employers 
China” in 2014. FAW-  Volks wa gen also won the “Best Enterprise to 
Work for Chinese Graduates in 2014” award presented by the 
 Chinese Ministry of Education and the country’s Center for Infor-
mation, Advice, Higher Education, Careers and Employment. In 
South Africa, the Top Employers Institute ranked  Volks wa gen of 
South Africa the country’s top employer for the fourth consecutive 
year in 2014. In the USA,  Volks wa gen Chattanooga received 
the “Best Place to Work” award for the second year running, while 
in Mexico,  Volks wa gen de México was the only automotive company 
to be recognized in a national student survey, “Empresa de los 
sueños de los jóvenes” (“Young people’s dream company”).
 V  The  Volks wa gen Group Academy  
groups together 13 individual Berufs­
familien Academies.
QUALIFICATION WITHIN THE BERUFSFAMILIEN
The provision of initial and in-service training to the highest 
standards across the  Volks wa gen Group is immensely important 
for our enduring success as a top technology company. Qualifica-
tion and personnel development for   Volks wa gen Group employees 
is based on the concept of professional families (“Berufsfamilien”). 
A “Berufsfamilie” includes all employees with shared expertise 
whose jobs require related skills. The Berufsfamilie is, therefore, 
the specialist “home” of every individual employee within the 
Group, from apprentices right up to senior experts, and the skills 
requirements of each Berufsfamilie determine individual employ-
ees’ needs for qualification. At almost all brands and companies 
these needs are identified at least once a year in the individual em-
ployee appraisal or qualification appraisal. Learning and teach-
ing in Berufsfamilien follow the dual model of vocational educa-
tion and training, in which theory and practice are closely linked.
This form of qualification requires a high level of organization. 
Training “Academies” are in place for a growing number of 
Berufsfamilien and organize cooperative learning across brands 
and locations. Qualification within the 36 Berufsfamilien cur-
rently takes place at 13 Berufsfamilien Academies. These are 
grouped under the umbrella of the   Volks wa gen Group Academy, 
whose aim is to leverage synergies and ensure an outstanding level 
of qualification across the Group.
Vocational Education and Training in Line  
with the Dual Model
Vocational education and training at  Volks wa gen is based on the 
dual model, and from the very first day, our apprentices are trained 
within a Berufsfamilie. The apprentices alternate regularly be-
tween blocks of classroom learning in a vocational school, periods 
in a training center and a range of assignments within a plant. 
This ensures that they have the best possible preparation for their 
future employment as young specialists or skilled workers within 
the relevant Berufsfamilie.

PEOPLE
Each year,  Volks wa gen AG invites school students to hands-on 
 experience days. Current apprentices and trainers brief them on 
what is involved in the various technical and commercial training 
professions and dual apprenticeships offered by  Volks wa gen. In 
2014, hands-on experience days were held in Wolfsburg, Hanover, 
Braunschweig, Kassel, Emden and Salzgitter. Similar informa-
tion events were also staged by the Audi, Porsche and MAN brands.
Dual Vocational Education and Training Goes Global
Just how seriously we take our responsibility for the next genera-
tion is demonstrated by the importance that   Volks wa gen assigns 
to vocational education and training. In December 2014, the 
 Volks wa gen Group was training 18,459 apprentices and students 
around the world in some 60 professions and 50 dual appren-
ticeships.  Volks wa gen AG,  Volks wa gen Osnabrück GmbH and 
 Volks wa gen Sachsen GmbH alone trained 5,418 apprentices in 
more than 30 professions and some 20 dual apprenticeships, once 
again more than in the previous year. In recent years the Group 
has rolled out the dual model of vocational education and training 
in many locations outside Germany. Over three-quarters of all 
 apprentices within the Group are currently being trained in line 
with this system, not only in Germany but also in Spain, Hungary, 
Russia, the USA, Mexico, India and China. A ceremony held in 
 October 2014 saw the 43 best former apprentices from a total of 
18 countries and 38 locations receive “Best Apprentice” awards. 
For the first time, former apprentices from   Volks wa gen India, 
 Volks wa gen Group of America and  Volks wa gen Group Retail 
Deutschland were among those receiving awards.
In 2012, SEAT became the first Spanish company to instigate dual 
vocational education and training, and in 2014, the company’s 
qualification program won it the Business Prize of the Chamber 
of Foreign Trade for Spain and the Francesc Maciá award, the 
 Catalan government’s top award for outstanding performance in 
the area of employment. Since 2012, we have also been building 
on existing close cooperation with China’s Ministry of Education 
in the area of vocational education and training. As part of this 
 cooperation, China’s Minister of Education, Prof. Guiren Yuan, 
visited  Volks wa gen’s Wolfsburg plant in October 2014.  Volks wa gen 
AG will be supporting the construction of further competence 
centers for teacher training in China.
 V SPECIAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECTS
Competition: The ProMechaniker competition gives apprentice motor 
vehicle mechatronic technicians with  Volks wa gen AG an opportunity 
to display and develop their technical skills. Requirements for taking 
part are a high level of commitment and motivation, excellent perfor-
mance as an apprentice, and an interest in motor racing. The competi-
tion was held for the fifth time in 2014. The two winners have a 
chance to work with the service team for the Scirocco R Cup series.
Vehicle development: Projects including the design of the Golf GTI 
Wolfsburg Edition and the ŠKODA CitiJet are further examples of 
the practical vocational education and training acquired by 
 Volks wa gen Group apprentices. Twelve apprentices were involved 
throughout the process from initial brainstorming to the launch of 
the Golf GTI Wolfsburg Edition, contributing their know-how and 
creativity and developing not only their specialist knowledge but 
also their teamworking skills. The ŠKODA CitiJet is the brainchild of 
Hands-on experience days provide young people with an insight into various professions as well as vocational education and training opportunities with the Group.

 V TOMORROW’S WORLD OF WORK
The  Volks wa gen Group in Germany is taking the lead in moderniz-
ing the training professions and spearheading the digitization of the 
world of work. Experts from the  Volks wa gen Group Academy joined 
forces with their counterparts in Germany’s Federal Institute for 
 Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) at the end of 2014 to as-
sess where the profiles of the different professions need amending 
and formulate proposals for the future orientation of vocational 
 education and training – initially in Germany and subsequently in 
other countries too.
In-Service Training for Young Skilled Workers
As part of the consistent roll-out of the dual model of vocational 
 education and training, young skilled workers are being qualified 
through training that closely links theory with on-the-job learn-
ing. Here the young people are supported by more experienced 
 colleagues. This model for learning in tandem is vital: the best way 
of passing on knowledge and experience is face to face. Particular-
ly talented apprentices are supported through “Talent Groups” at 
each location. This two-year development and skills training 
 program recruits the best ten percent of apprentices from each 
year’s intake, with an emphasis on the individual development of 
technical excellence.
In October 2014, the Group Board of Management and the Group Global Works Council presented the 14th “Best Apprentice Awards” to the Group’s top 
 apprentices. Awards were presented to 11 women and 32 men from a total of 18 countries and 38 locations.
the “Azubi Car” (“Apprentice Car”) project, a training project launched 
in 2014. This sporty convertible was built by 16 young apprentices 
from the ŠKODA AUTO vocational school.
“A year’s support”: Since 2012, Porsche has been running a program 
entitled “Förderjahr” (“A year’s support”), governed by collective 
agreement and offering disadvantaged young people the oppor-
tunity to undergo formal skills training. Over a period of ten 
months, participants take part in a skills development program that 
prepares them for an apprenticeship. In the first two years, 2012 
and 2013, eleven young people began the program. In the mean-
time, nine participants from the first intake and all eleven from the 
second year have successfully completed the course and begun an 
apprenticeship. Ten more young people kicked off their “year’s 
support” in November 2014.
Commitment: The  Volks wa gen Group’s commitment to the 
Auschwitz Memorial and Museum is recognized around the world. 
Six times a year, groups of  Volks wa gen AG apprentices travel to 
Auschwitz to spend two weeks working with young Poles at the 
Memorial and Museum; since 2012, apprentices from subsidiaries 
and affiliated companies have also been involved in the scheme. 
Some 2,600 young Germans and Poles have so far taken part in this 
program in the 26 years it has been running. This involvement fos-
ters responsibility and develops apprentices’ powers of judgment, 
tolerance and openness to different cultures. Since 2008, separate 
groups of managers, management talents and “Meister” (group 
leaders) have also been involved.
60
PEOPLE
 V  In 2014,  Volks wa gen AG  recruited a total 
of 330 graduates in Germany, of whom 
around 30% were female.
Fostering Graduates
 Volks wa gen AG recruits and fosters young graduates though the 
Student Talent Bank and the Academic Talent Pool.  Volks wa gen 
has been using the Student Talent Bank since 1998 to bring on 
 particularly able students in workplace-related and cross-func-
tional areas. The aim is to boost these former interns’ commit-
ment to the Company and to give them the best possible prepara-
tion for embarking on a career with  Volks wa gen, for example 
through talks and presentations, seminars, and trips.
Shortly before they graduate or complete their doctorate, these 
 talented students are then moved into the Academic Talent Pool, a 
recruitment tool that provides the Company with a way to identify 
individuals with potential for graduate-level entry into a special-
ized area within  Volks wa gen. 
StartUp Trainee Programs
Trainees starting their careers with  Volks wa gen benefit from 
 systematic structures such as the StartUp Direct program for grad-
uates, designed to enable trainees to acquire an in-depth famil-
iarization with the area in which they will be working in future. 
StartUp Direct trainees also spend two years undertaking a range 
of qualification measures, giving them an opportunity to get to 
know  Volks wa gen in detail and to build their own network. 
The StartUp Cross program is aimed at graduates with an interna-
tional focus. The aim of the 18-month program is to familiarize 
trainees with the Company as a whole and to help them build an 
extensive national and international network. Trainees therefore 
complete project placements of a few weeks in different parts of 
the  ompany and in various locations both in Germany and abroad. 
Both StartUp programs also include a placement in the production 
sector lasting several weeks. Since 2008, over 3,100 trainees have 
gained their first experience of  Volks wa gen in this way.
 V ENTRY OPTIONS FOR YOUNG ENGINEERS FROM SOUTHERN  EUROPE
Many young engineering graduates in southern Europe are having 
difficulty finding employment despite good qualifications. Since 
2012, our StartUp Europe program has been offering them an 
 opportunity to start a career. In 2014 the program was extended 
to  Italy. Participants complete a placement with the  Volks wa gen 
Group in their home country and then move to Germany for up to 
21 months to work in a Group company there. In 2014, 30 partici-
pants were already offered permanent employment in the 
 Volks wa gen Group on completing the two-year program. Since the 
initiative was launched in 2012, no fewer than 6,700 young people 
have applied for a total of 73 places.
Promoting Intercultural Understanding
The  Volks wa gen Group promotes intercultural understanding 
 between young employees through a program enabling them to 
work abroad, known as the “Wanderjahre” (years abroad – the 
singular is “Wanderjahr”) program. The name alludes to the 
 tradition among newly-qualified craftsmen of travelling the 
world and gaining experience. Since 2006, young people at the 
start of their career have had the opportunity, on completion of 
their training, to spend 12 months working for a Group company 
outside their home country. A total of 37  Volks wa gen Group 
 locations in 19 countries are now involved in this development 
program. And for the very first time, one employee started her 
Wanderjahr at the plant in Tianjin (China). So far, 456 young 
 employees from across the  Volks wa gen Group have taken up this 
 opportunity. In 2014, 51 participants from Germany and eleven 
from a further six countries embarked on their Wanderjahre at 
one of the Group’s locations.
Numerous Qualification Measures Available
The  Volks wa gen Group Academy offers employees a wide range of 
qualification measures. Along with general in-service training 
courses and qualification within the Berufsfamilien, these also 
include personnel management development programs. During 
2014, a total of 86,193 participants benefited from 10,196 qualifi-
cation measures organized by the  Volks wa gen Group Academy, 
representing 214,621 participant-days. In the product technology 
and product quality areas, 16,495 participants attended 2,267 
in-service training and qualification measures over 36,125 par-
ticipant-days, while in the field of cross-functional qualification, 
35,515 participants attended 2,844 courses over 103,462 partici-
pant-days. A total of 334 new programs and training measures 
The StartUp Cross program is aimed at graduates with an international 
 focus.

were introduced during the reporting year, ensuring that in- 
service training provision continues to reflect the Company’s 
 current needs.
Standards for Personnel Development in Leadership  
and Management
In early 2014, the  Volks wa gen, Audi, MAN, SEAT, ŠKODA and 
 Porsche brands agreed uniform standards for the personnel de-
velopment of future leaders and managers within the   Volks wa gen 
Group. Within  Volks wa gen Deutschland alone, more than 190 
leadership, Meister (group leader) and management qualification 
measures were held in 2014, including assessment centers for as-
piring managers. Outside Germany, the  Volks wa gen Group Acad-
emy ran a total of some 60 courses for leaders, Meister and manag-
ers and assessment centers for aspiring managers in the Czech 
Republic, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom and 
in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa and the 
USA. 2014 saw the ongoing roll-out of personnel development 
 programs at the Bentley, SEAT and ŠKODA brands. Group 
 locations outside Germany also staged some 400 qualification 
and  selection events of their own for future leaders and manag-
ers. MAN, too, places great emphasis on training its employees 
and raising their awareness: MAN Truck & Bus continued its

 successful “Manage Responsibly” leadership training program,

Training the Trainers
In 2014, we placed particular emphasis on the cross-locational 
and cross-brand qualification of the trainers who deliver our 
 programs for leaders, Meister and managers, as well as of the 
 assessment center facilitators. This will enable us to ensure com-
parable quality across the Group. The “ Volks wa gen Group Acade-
my Campus” initiative, which has been running since 2012, con-
tinues to be rolled out and provides a series of events designed to 
develop a global pool of trainers and facilitators. In 2014, around 
70 participants from around the world took part in two such events. 
For the first time, face-to-face training ran alongside online 
learning programs and virtual networks for this target group.
Academic In-Service Training at the AutoUni
Under the auspices of the  Volks wa gen Group Academy, the Auto-
Uni provides a source of specialist academic knowledge. It has 
nine institutes and works with the Berufsfamilien Academies 
and partner universities to provide training for the Group’s 
Vocational training is crucial to the development of an outstanding team.
62
PEOPLE
 experts and top specialists. Its wide range of training formats 
 ensures that the wealth of knowledge held within the Group, at 
universities and by private sector experts is passed on and new 
knowledge generated. The areas the AutoUni focuses on include 
electric traction,  innovative drivetrains, lightweight design and 
the sustainability of transport systems. The Institute of Com-
puter Science, set up in 2013, was expanded in 2014 to focus on 
two key areas, the digital workplace of the future and IT security. 
A  further new institute, the Institute for Quality, was also set up 
during the reporting year. The AutoUni is closely involved in a 
range of research projects and collaborates with leading interna-
tional universities, research institutes and research centers on 
graduate and postgraduate research. In 2014, the Group super-
vised over 500 doctoral students working on areas relevant to the 
Group in the various  Volks wa gen Group companies within Ger-
many. The AutoUni, which is based in Wolfsburg, has also made 
its courses available outside Germany for some years now. In 
2014, for example, its work was extended to locations in Bratisla-
va  (Slovakia), Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic) and the Chinese 
 locations of Changchun, Shanghai and Beijing. In 2014, around 
8,600 people took part in over 180 AutoUni courses. The AutoUni 
also supplies more than 750 speakers each year, almost half of 
them from the automotive engineering sector.
Networking Academic Knowledge
The AutoUni supports doctoral students by providing seminars on 
academic writing, while its doctoral colloquium offers them the 
opportunity to present their work-in-progress to a Group-wide 
 audience and discuss their theses. AutoUni also advises and 
 supports the   Volks wa gen Group in identifying appropriate aca-
demic partners from within research and teaching. It networks 
the individuals responsible for university contacts within the 
Group to create synergies between brands and companies and to 
ensure that the processes are consistent. To provide impetus for 
basic research in the area of storage technology, in 2014 the inter-
national “Science Award Electrochemistry” was again presented 
by  Volks wa gen and BASF. The award went to Dr. Vanessa Wood 
from the ETH in  Zurich, Switzerland, in recognition of outstand-
ing research findings related to lithium-ion batteries. 
PERFORMANCE AND PARTICIPATION
Fair pay and an appropriate share in the Company’s success 
 underpin the motivation and performance of our employees but 
also help to protect jobs and keep us competitive. Employee 
 participation and co-determination rights for employee repre-
sentatives are further key factors in the   Volks wa gen Group’s 
 success, so we engage in dialogue with our employees to set stand-
ards for good work.
 V FAIR PAY ANCHORED IN SOCIAL CHARTER
In line with our Social Charter, all remuneration and benefits for a 
normal working week should be at least in line with the enforceable 
statutory minimum and should ensure that our employees and 
their families have an appropriate standard of living. When setting 
collectively agreed pay, the employer and the trade unions ensure 
that starting pay is in line with local minimum rates of pay. We 
make no distinction between female and male employees. Our first 
overseas plant to implement this, the  Volks wa gen do Brasil facility 
in Anchieta, is a beacon in this respect: the parties to the collective 
agreement agreed that starting pay for shop floor workers should 
be equivalent to 2.21 times Brazil’s statutory minimum wage.

Recognizing Performance and Sharing Profits
The systematic fostering and recognition of good performance is a 
vital element in our personnel management strategy, along with 
redesigning our pay system to ensure that employees have a sus-
tainable share in the success and profits of the Company. Since 
2010,  Volks wa gen AG has had detailed standard criteria for skills 
development and performance assessment. These criteria cover 
the entire workforce, from apprentices to top managers, and are 
underpinned by concrete incentive systems within a three-tier pay 
system:
 > basic pay in the form of a competitive monthly salary
 > a performance-related component, which rewards individual 
performance
 > an entitlement to profit-sharing, which is laid down by collective 
agreement
This three-tier remuneration system is increasingly being rolled 
out across the Group. It gives us transparent criteria for recogniz-
ing good performance on the part of our employees and enables 
them to participate appropriately in the Company’s success. In 
2014, employees at more than 30 Group locations benefited from 
profit-sharing, including those in China, Mexico, Poland, Russia 
and Spain.
Annual Appraisal
As part of the introduction of a performance-related pay compo-
nent, it was agreed that each employee of  Volks wa gen AG, 
 Volks wa gen Financial Services AG and  Volks wa gen Immobilien 
Service GmbH should have an annual appraisal with his or her 
line manager. This appraisal has two components, performance 
assessment and development planning. Recognizing and valuing 
good performance is just as important in this context as identify-
ing individual potential or specific further training needs. Since 
2013, all temporary external personnel employed at  Volks wa gen 
AG have also benefited from a performance-related pay compo-
nent from their second year with  Volks wa gen. The process by 
which this component is determined is similar to the individual 
annual employee appraisal process for  Volks wa gen employees. 
The system of appraisals, which is linked in part to a perfor-
mance-related pay component, is gradually being rolled out across 
Group brands and companies. It was introduced for all employees 
covered by collective bargaining at   Volks wa gen Group Rus in 
 Kaluga (Russia) in 2013 and at Bentley Motors Ltd. in Crewe 
(United Kingdom) in 2014.
Long-Term Incentive for Management
The pay for management employees across the Group includes 
three variable components: 
 >  the personal performance bonus, 
 > the Company bonus and 
 > the Long Term Incentive (LTI), introduced in 2010.
MANAGEMENT APPROACH

PERFORMANCE AND PARTICIPATION
HEALTH AND FITNESS 
ADVANCING WOMEN AND DIVERSIT Y
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y
The LTI is calculated over a four-year period, making it the compo-
nent that reflects sustainable development by the Company. Com-
ponents of this kind were required by the 2009 legislation on 
 remuneration of Board of Management members, but the LTI is 
applied more widely at the  Volks wa gen Group to the whole of its 
management. The Long Term Incentive is linked directly to the 
goals set out in the Group’s Strategy 2018: top employer status and 
top ratings for customer satisfaction, sales and profitability.
 V COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS IN 2014 
There was no collective bargaining within the  Volks wa gen Group in 
Germany in 2014, but 12 collective agreements were concluded at 
locations outside Germany. In some cases, there was a move to-
wards long-term agreements that protect employment and boost 
competitiveness. For example,  Volks wa gen Slovakia, Sitech Polska 
and  Volks wa gen India all signed agreements running for more than 
30 months.
Flexibility and Employment Security
Within the  Volks wa gen Group we use a wide range of flexibility 
tools to help maintain competitiveness and protect jobs. In 2014, 
we again responded rapidly to changes in the business environ-
ment. Some 200 Portuguese production staff from   Volks wa gen 
Autoeuropa continued to work at   Volks wa gen AG in Wolfsburg. 
 Under the collective agreement on sustainable site retention and 
employment security, all  Volks wa gen AG employees enjoy employ-
ment security.
As part of the introduction of a performance-related pay component, it was 
agreed that each employee of  Volks wa gen AG,  Volks wa gen Financial Services AG 
and  Volks wa gen Immobilien Service GmbH should have an annual appraisal with 
his or her line manager.

PEOPLE
Employing Former Apprentices
 Volks wa gen AG is bound by an agreement that provides for appren-
tices to be given permanent employment on completion of their 
training, subject to specific performance criteria. Former appren-
tices who do not meet these criteria are initially offered a two-year 
fixed-term contract. After two years, the performance assessment 
that forms part of their individual annual appraisal and regular 
feedback are used to decide whether to take them on permanently. 
 V RECRUITING LOCAL PERSONNEL
 Volks wa gen supports the recruitment and qualification of local per-
sonnel as a way of developing the local communities and regions in 
which we operate. This applies for example at the new Audi México 
plant and at the new plant in Urumqi (China), where we plan to 
 employ the groups that make up the region’s population on a pro 
rata basis.
Participation and Co-Determination
Within the  Volks wa gen Group there are many different forms of 
employee representation, but in most cases, employees are repre-
sented in two ways: by their trade union, and by a company repre-
sentative body. Most of these company bodies are elected by all 
 local employees and so represent the interests of the employees 
within the Company. Trade unions primarily represent the inter-
ests of their members. This principle of twin representation of 
 employees has proved successful across the   Volks wa gen Group. 
When substantial changes are being planned in the Company, 
employee representatives are involved in the process from an early 
stage, a provision that is written into the global agreement on coop-
eration between Group management, the Group European Works 
Council and the Group Global Works Council. 
 V TRADE UNION ORGANIZATION
The shop floor employees in 98% of all fully consolidated 
 Volks wa gen Group companies are represented by a trade union or 
covered by collective agreement. At the Audi México plant in San 
José Chiapa, which is still under construction, the newly created 
trade union SITAUDI was officially registered in December 2013.
Charter on Labour Relations
The Group-wide International Charter on Labour Relations first 
came into force in 2009. It sets out the practical implementation 
of the right to participation and links increased participation 
rights with shared responsibility. The Charter applies interna-
tionally and provides for phased rights to information, consulta-
tion and co-determination for employee representatives of the 
brands and companies represented on the Group Global Works 
Council. The rights it guarantees employee representatives relate, 
among other areas, to personnel management and industrial 
 relations provisions, work organization, remuneration systems, 
information and communications, initial and in-service train-
ing, occupational health and safety, process controlling, and 
 social and environmental sustainability. The Group Global 
Works Council and Company management regularly monitor 
 implementation of the Charter on Labour Relations in individual 
Group companies. 
Local Implementation of Co-Determination
Since the Charter on Labour Relations was introduced in 2009, 
management and employee representatives at many locations out-
side Germany have negotiated declarations of intent and outlined 
implementation arrangements. 2014 also saw new plant-level 
agreements being concluded at ŠKODA India and  Volks wa gen 
 Sarajevo. Other Group locations, such as the ŠKODA plant in 
Kvasiny in the Czech Republic, held inaugural works meetings. 
Employees at the  Volks wa gen plant in Kaluga (Russia) elected 
 social partners to represent their concerns. And in many loca-
tions, including  Volks wa gen Group Italia and MAN in Steyr (Aus-
tria), the work of local employee representatives is now being 
 organized within special committees and was stepped up in 2014. 
Many locations also held training workshops in 2014 to help em-
ployee representatives to implement the Charter on Labour Rela-
tions locally: these included MAN Steyr,  Volks wa gen Navarra, 
 Volks wa gen Sarajevo and  Volks wa gen India Pune alongside work-
shops for the sales and financial services companies  Volks wa gen 
Group Italia and   Volks wa gen Group Polska.
Developing Employee Representation Structures 
An agreement was signed at Group Global Works Council level 
in 2014 providing for a Mechanical Engineering Committee 
to be convened, comprising employee representatives from 
 Volks wa gen AG, MAN Diesel & Turbo SE, and Renk AG. This joins 
the Commercial Vehicles Committee, which was set up in 2012 to 
bring together employee representatives from the Scania, MAN 
and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles brands, and the Sales and 
Financial Services Committee, set up in 2008. To improve the 
 situation of workers, working conditions, participation rights 
and employment security in the Group’s Chinese joint ventures, a 
 Liaison and Coordinating Committee was set up back in 2008, 
which meets twice a year and discusses industrial relations with-
in the Group in China. It also discusses a wide range of specialist 
issues, such as the Global Charter on Labour Relations, occupa-
tional safety, and vocational education and training.
Charter on Temporary Work
The Charter on Temporary Work, signed in November 2012, rep-
resents agreement between Group management, the Group Euro-
pean Works Council and the Group Global Works Council on the 
key principles governing the use of temporary work across the 
Group. The main provisions of the Charter relate to:
65
 >  The reasonable use of temporary work as a key flexibility tool
 > Implementation of equal pay with reference to the standard 
 basic salary 
 > Implementation of equal treatment: temporary external person-
nel should enjoy parity of employment conditions and training 
provision with the core workforce
This Charter offers all temporary external personnel the chance to 
be moved on to a permanent contract provided they have the neces-
sary skills and the Company has a need for those skills.  
The Employee Opinion Survey 
The Group-wide Employee Opinion Survey, or “Stimmungsba-
rometer”, regularly measures employee satisfaction. Once the 
survey is complete, the findings are jointly discussed by supervi-
sors and employees, focusing on complaints and problems as well 
as on suggestions for improving work organization. Together, 
 supervisors and employees define the necessary measures re-
quired to trigger and implement change. The employee opinion 
survey was conducted for the seventh time in 2014. The survey 
 covered 150 locations and companies in 44 countries. Out of the 
more than 490,000 employees at the brands and companies that 
have already implemented the employee opinion survey, over 
440,000 employees took part. This equates to a response rate of 89 
percent, which was the same as in 2013. Companies taking part 
for the first time in 2014 included Porsche Leipzig GmbH, subsidi-
aries of Porsche AG, Ducati Motor Holding spa, MAN Diesel & 
 Turbo, MAN Latin America,   Volks wa gen Automatic Transmission 
(Tianjin),  Volks wa gen R & Accessory China, and ŠKODA Auto 
Deutschland. 
 28 
Ideas Management
Under the Ideas Management program our employees use their 
creativity, knowledge and initiative to improve both processes 
and products. Ideas management is a vital management and 
 motivational tool and has been an integral part of  Volks wa gen’s 
culture of improvement for the past 65 years. The ideas manage-
ment process also helps to make working at  Volks wa gen both safer 
and healthier.

The “ Volks wa gen Way”
The “ Volks wa gen Way” is a central and successful tool for securing 
continuous improvement. At its core is a process of continuous im-
provement that aims permanently to develop productivity and 
quality as well as ergonomics, leadership and teamwork. In 2014, 
the focus was on optimizing overarching workflows. In July 2014, 
the first “ Volks wa gen Way” symposium was held for the Technical 
Development department at the Wolfsburg plant.
Company Benefits
We want to offer many of our employees the opportunity to drive a 
vehicle from at least one Group brand and are continually improv-
ing the framework for doing this. The terms of this benefit must be 
affordable for the employee and commercially viable for the 
brands. 
Employees of Group companies around the world also enjoy fur-
ther company benefits: these may include subsidized transport 
and meals, low-cost accommodation, monthly childcare allow-
ances, and discounts on selected leisure activities. Additional

health care benefits round off the range of company benefits. 
Since 2014, employees at  Volks wa gen AG, AUDI AG and a further 
nine Group companies in Germany have benefited from re-
duced-price rail travel under the “Job-Ticket” scheme.  Volks wa gen 
AG also contributes to the benefits provided by social insurance 
schemes, such as sick pay, and supports dependents when an 
 employee dies. The Company also has a collective accident insur-
ance policy that covers all employees against accidents resulting in 
death or invalidity. In exceptional cases of economic hardship, 
 Volks wa gen AG grants employees a short-term loan. 
The Company Pension Plan
 Volks wa gen AG, all its brands and all its subsidiaries in Germany 
run company pension plans to ensure that former employees have 
a source of income in retirement. At   Volks wa gen AG, the arrange-
ments comprise a basic pension and contributory pensions I and 
II. The basic pension and contributory pension I are employ-
er-funded, while contributory pension II offers employees an op-
portunity to convert part of their pre-tax salary into pension con-
tributions. Since 2001, payments to   Volks wa gen AG’s Company 
pension plan have been invested in the capital markets by the 
scheme, which is administered in trust by the  Volks wa gen Pension 
Trust e. V. By the end of 2014, 22 other Group companies in Ger-
many were also using these arrangements. Employees can also 
make direct contributions to their own pension provision by con-
verting a proportion of their salary into pension contributions.
 V THE TIME ASSET BOND
 Volks wa gen AG’s Time Asset Bond is a scheme to reduce the length 
of an employee’s working life. Since 1998, the Bond has offered em-
ployees the chance to contribute to it out of their gross salary or 
their working time credits. Their contributions are invested in the 
capital markets by the Time Asset Fund, which is administered in 
trust by the  Volks wa gen Pension Trust. The time assets accumulat-
ed can then be used to enable employees to take paid time off in 
the run-up to retirement.
HEALTH AND FITNESS
The   Volks wa gen Group’s integrated approach to health manage-
ment goes well beyond traditional preventive health care and 
occupational safety and also includes aspects such as work 
 organization, ergonomics, health promotion, integration and 
rehabilitation, leadership styles and prospects for each individ-
ual. To ensure a common standard of health provision across the 
Group, a multi-level audit system was introduced in 2010.
Ergonomic Strategies
The Group continues to place a high priority on improving produc-
tion ergonomics. The aim is to keep our employees fit and healthy 
throughout their working lives. In consultation with the 
 Volks wa gen Passenger Cars, Audi and  Volks wa gen Commercial 
Vehicles brands, we have produced a handbook to underpin a 
standardized approach to ergonomics in the product development 
process, known by its German acronym as “PEP”. The handbook is 
due to be rolled out across further brands in 2015.
The online system “Massnahmen@web” (“measures@web”, the 
Group’s system for documenting, following-up and assessing 
 optimization measures) enables an interdisciplinary team of edi-
tors to disseminate examples of good practice throughout the 
Group. At “Ergonomics Days”, experts present ergonomic innova-
tions from the locations. AUDI AG staged an ergonomics fair at 
its Neckarsulm plant as part of the “Wir für uns. Aktiv in die 
 Zukunft” (“Helping ourselves. Preparing for an active future”) 
strategy. At  Volks wa gen’s Wolfsburg plant, meanwhile, an inaugu-
ral  “Ergonomics Day” showcased sector-specific logistics solu-
tions. Along with ergonomics in the production and logistics 
 sectors, activities were also staged to foster office ergonomics. 
 Examples include new lighting concepts and a teaching film on 
healthy postures for people with sedentary jobs.
Free Health Checkups
The Checkup is a free, comprehensive preventive medical exami-
nation available at all locations in Germany and around the world. 
It helps maintain and improve the health, fitness and perfor-
mance of the workforce. Employees value the high diagnostic 
quality of the checkups.

Prevention Measures 
In 2014, we expanded the prevention and training provision 
linked with the Checkup, improved its quality and systematized it. 
In particular, we created and modernized medical training 
centers and fitness suites, introduced rehabilitation measures 
and health coaching, set up training on behavioral ergonomics, 
and launched new fitness and wellness programs. The “Fit im 
Büro” (“Fit in the Office”) program is a behavioral ergonomics 
 program for employees working in an office environment, while 
its sister program, “Fit im Werk” (“Fit in the Factory”), aims to re-
duce physical stresses and strains on those working on the shop 
floor. Between May 2013 and June 2014, some 15,700 employees 
completed one of these programs at  Volks wa gen in Wolfsburg. 
Across the Group, a holistic approach to health management also 
includes healthcare schemes, a wide range of sport and leisure 
provision, and measures such as the weight-loss and healthy eat-
ing campaign run by   Volks wa gen South Africa or the company run 
organized by MAN Truck & Bus in Munich.
As a matter of course,  Volks wa gen health services are available to 
the entire workforce, but for specific occupations, the current legis-
lative framework makes such provision mandatory. In 2014, 20,924 
 Volks wa gen AG employees were covered by such requirements.
 V HEALTH PROGRAMS AROUND THE GROUP
BeFit at Bentley: With the aim of encouraging employees to adopt 
a healthy lifestyle, Bentley launched its “BeFit” health campaign in 
2014. The program focuses on four areas: Weight and Nutrition; 
Stress and Depression; the Corporate Step Challenge; and Exercise 
and Back Care.
Combating HIV and AIDS in South Africa:  Volks wa gen continued its 
international commitment to combating infectious diseases in 
2014, for example through continuing measures against HIV/AIDS 
at  Volks wa gen in South Africa. This program received a subsidy of 
ZAR 500,000, and by 2014, 93% of the workforce had taken the 
 opportunity to be tested for HIV/AIDS.
Home Care and Baby Care at  Volks wa gen do Brasil: The Home Care 
program is geared to those of all ages with chronic conditions and 
offers both medical care and supportive outpatient care. The Baby 
Care program focuses on the welfare of the next generation and 
provides expert support for parents and their newborn babies in 
the first few weeks and months.

In 2004, the  Volks wa gen Group documented its underlying princi-
ples and obligations in relation to occupational health and safety 
in an agreement with the Group Global Works Council. 
In 2014, the Group issued the corporate policy entitled “Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Protection in the  Volks wa gen Group”. 
This applies to all brands and companies and sets out underlying 
goals, responsibilities and standards in relation to occupational 
safety and health protection. At the same time, another document, 
the “Guidelines on Health Protection and Health Promotion in the 
 Volks wa gen Group” – a supplement to the corporate policy includ-
ing concrete examples – was brought up to date. Both of these 
 documents, the corporate policy and the guidelines, are due to be 
signed off in 2015.
The  Volks wa gen Group sets the same standards for work organi-
zation, occupational safety and health care for its employees no 
matter where in the world it operates, taking account of the local 
medical infrastructure and the local legislative framework in each 
case. Compliance with these globally applicable standards is 
 monitored through audits conducted across the Group.
Raising Awareness and Training
In the course of personnel development activities, supervisors in 
the Company are being made aware of the need to take greater 
 account of the links between leadership and employees’ health. 
Seminars foster a health-promoting and family-oriented style of 
leadership.
Since 2009, occupational safety officers at all German locations 
have been receiving occupational safety qualification. In addi-
tion, since early 2012,  Volks wa gen in Germany has been organ-
izing compulsory qualification modules on occupational safety 
for all future supervisors. On the basis of these modules, the 
qualification building blocks for future Meister were standard-
ized in 2013 and made a compulsory part of the group leader 
qualification.
The Chairless Chair makes many assembly activities easier. This high-tech 
 carbon-fiber construction allows employees to sit without a chair. At the same 
time, it improves their posture and reduces the strain on their legs.

Group Occupational Safety Management System 
On the basis of the Group’s occupational safety management sys-
tem (KAMS), which was introduced in 2010, the companies in the 
 Volks wa gen Passenger Cars Division and the  Volks wa gen Com-
mercial Vehicles Division analyzed their existing occupational 
safety structures and processes. The findings are available across 
the Group via a central database. A health and safety committee 
has been set up at each included site to represent the entire local 
workforce. Moreover, all those involved agreed to conduct a 
brand-specific audit at all  Volks wa gen locations around the world 
from 2012. During the reporting year, the Group’s occupational 
safety management system was successfully audited at São Carlos 
and Curitiba (Brazil), Pamplona (Spain) and Pacheco (Argentina).
 V AWARD-WINNING OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY 
2014 saw the 29th annual Occupational Safety Cup competition for 
 Volks wa gen brand and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles locations 
in Europe: the cup for the safest location went to the Braunschweig 
plant in Germany.  Volks wa gen Slovakia won a prize for its contribu-
tion to ergonomics at the country’s 17th productivity and ergonom-
ics forum in October 2014. And  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles 
won the safety award presented by the timber and metalworking 
trade association in Germany for its “GeSA” project, which focuses 
on health and safety for apprentices.
 V OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PROTECTION IN FOCUS 
FROM THE OUTSET AT AUDI MÉXICO
Audi aims to consider high-quality health protection for all employ-
ees from the planning stage onwards when it builds new factories 
and is taking health protection considerations into account in the 
construction of its new plant in San José Chiapa in Mexico. Under 
the relevant Development Agreement, the government has built a 
hospital near the plant, which will also improve healthcare in the 
region as a whole. To ensure that sick or injured employees are 
treated promptly, a medical unit has been integrated into the new 
training center.
Company Medical Services and Emergency Situation 
Management 
Medical services and health care for   Volks wa gen Group employees 
are in line with national legislation and internal regulations as 
well as with Group guidelines on protecting and promoting health. 
All Group locations have at least emergency health provision, 
while most locations offer medical services under the oversight of 
a doctor.
Rehabilitation Measures
In many locations we offer a tailored rehabilitation program to 
 reintegrate employees after serious and/or long-term illness, pro-
viding early intervention and job-related support. The aim is to 
stabilize or restore the employees’ capacity and performance abil-
ity within three to six months. Depending on the particular needs 
in each case, the program can also include preventive provision. 
Examples here could be “JobReha” (one to three weeks of outpa-
tient, day-care or in-patient measures focused on the problem 
zones in the locomotor system), the RehaFit program (orthopedic, 
psychological rehabilitation) and physiotherapy provision, as well 
as individual or general rehabilitation training at in-house train-
ing centers. Support and mentoring opportunities for employees 
with mental health or psychosomatic problems are also being 
 expanded on an ongoing basis.
 Volks wa gen AG’s Work2Work program has been creating new job 
opportunities for performance-impaired employees since 2001. It 
focuses on achieving an optimal fit between the requirements of 
the workplace and employees’ existing potential, enabling them to 
make a major contribution to creating value despite their perfor-
mance impairment. Over recent years, some 1,850 employees 
have benefited from the program, and over 810 people are now em-
ployed in Work2Work jobs in Wolfsburg in some 95 different fields 
of activity.
Based on the three principles of responsibility, autonomy and soli-
darity, the success story of Work2Work is being continuously rolled 
out and taken forward. Here, though, the Company is not merely 
proving itself a socially responsible employer, because according 
to a remarkable study entitled “Social Return on Investment”, con-
ducted in 2014 in collaboration with the Catholic University of 
 Volks wa gen AG’s Work2Work program creates new job opportunities for 
performance-impaired employees with the Company. In the Automotive 
Learnware department at the Wolfsburg plant, 39 employees develop and 
produce teaching and learning materials for the automotive sector for 
Chambers of Trade and vocational schools.
69
Eichstatt-Ingolstadt,   Volks wa gen’s Work2Work program is also 
an economically viable concept for integrating employees with im-
paired capacity. It saves operational costs of around €29,000 per 
employee per year and savings on social and employment costs of 
up to €65,000 per employee per year once elements like potential 
disability pensions or transitional payments are also taken into 
account. Furthermore, the Work2Work program has been shown 
to bring qualitative benefits in terms of health and to have a posi-
tive impact on employees’ satisfaction with their work and lives.
The Automotive Learnware department at the Wolfsburg plant is a 
fine example of how performance-impaired employees can be 
 integrated. Here, 39 employees develop and produce teaching and 
learning materials for the automotive sector for Chambers of 
Trade and vocational schools. No fewer than 25 performance-im-
paired employees under the Work2Work program form an inte-
gral part of the department, which generated sales revenue of 
€1.92 million in 2014. The product portfolio extends from fault 
simulators and test equipment to complete or cut-away training 
vehicles. Learnware is distributed in 57 countries across all five 
continents.
 V PROVISION FOR OLDER EMPLOYEES
On the initiative of the German automotive industry’s representa-
tives of people with disabilities, in 2014  Volks wa gen AG, AUDI AG 
and Porsche AG continued their involvement in a research project 
entitled “Ageing Healthily and Appropriately in the Automotive 
 Industry: Career-Long Participation and Inclusion” and known by its 
German acronym, PINA. This cooperation project, which is funded 
by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Labour, develops tools and initia-
tives to maintain employees’ health and capacity throughout their 
working lives. The term of the project has been extended until the 
end of April 2015, with the additional time being used in particular 
to trial products developed as part of the project.  
 V SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION AT AUDI
Audi has developed a systematic and transparent process to provide 
targeted support for the reintegration of performance-impaired 
employees and those with disabilities. A study conducted at the 
 Ingolstadt plant by the University of St. Gallen surveyed around 
15,000 shop floor workers and found high levels of satisfaction 
with the integration process.
ADVANCING WOMEN AND DIVERSITY 
There is enormous potential within the diversity of the   Volks wa gen 
Group workforce. As we move towards becoming top employer in 
the automotive sector, we want to make use of this potential by 
 explicitly advancing women, improving the scope for combining 
work and family, and making full use of the cultural diversity that 
exists within the Group.
Voluntary Undertaking
The  Volks wa gen Group is aiming to have 30% women at all levels 
of the management hierarchy in Germany in the long term. In 
1989,  Volks wa gen AG became the first major German company to 
formulate guidelines on advancing women. As early as 2007, 
 Volks wa gen AG set specific targets for increasing the proportion of 
women in the Company, and in spring 2011, the Group set differ-
entiated targets within the framework of a voluntary undertaking 
to achieve sustainable growth in the proportion of women working 
for the Company in Germany. These include:
 >  Increasing the proportion of female apprentices 
 > Increasing the proportion of female Meister and skilled workers
 > Increasing the proportion of female graduate and professional 
recruits
 > Increasing the proportion of female executives
We have a range of programs to help us achieve these targets.
Recruiting Talented Women
In 2014, women accounted for around 21.8% of all   Volks wa gen 
Group apprentices in industrial or technical areas. To increase 
this to 30%, we specifically target the recruitment of talented 
women, for example through the nationwide “Girls’ Day”, which 
offers young women an opportunity to experience what a career 
with   Volks wa gen can offer them. The “Lower Saxony Technikum” 
is a scheme in which the  Volks wa gen brand offers female students 
with the Abitur – Germany’s school-leaving examination – a six-
month internship designed to stimulate their interest in studying a 
technical subject. In 2014, 26 young women completed the “Lower 
Saxony Technikum”. We also forge links with female undergradu-
ates at an early stage in their studies. For example,   Volks wa gen AG 
runs a “Woman Experience Day”. Since 2004,  Volks wa gen AG has 
also been running the Germany-wide “Woman DrivING Award”, a 
competition aimed at top female engineers.
Systematically Recruiting Female Graduates
In recruiting graduates, we take as our starting point the propor-
tion of female graduates in each discipline, so that, for example, 
around 10% of all the mechanical or electrical engineers we re-
cruit should be women. This rises to 50% in business administra-
tion. When all the disciplines relevant to  Volks wa gen’s work are 
averaged out, these differentiated quotas produce a recruitment 
target of at least 30% female graduates. In the reporting year, 
around 30% of graduate recruits at  Volks wa gen AG were female.

Mentoring Programs for Women 
Having been through 21 cycles with almost 400 female partici-
pants,  Volks wa gen AG’s mentoring scheme for female skilled 
workers and managers is a recognized development program 
within the Group for bringing on talented women. In 2014, we also 
instigated a new management mentoring program, which is 
launching its first 42 women from the  Volks wa gen, Audi and MAN 
brands and further subsidiaries on their management careers. 
And the program to mentor female Meister run by  Volks wa gen AG 
aims to increase the proportion of female skilled workers and 
Meister in Germany to 10%. In 2014, 25 female Meister received 
support through this program.
Combining Work and Family
As well as recruiting and promoting talented women, the 
 Volks wa gen Group is working continually to improve employ-
ees’ ability to combine work and family responsibilities. The 
support we offer includes:
 > Substantial flexibility in relation to hours of work
 > An extensive range of part-time and shift-working arrange-
ments
 > A return to work at the same level after parental leave
 > Childcare either within or near the company premises
To maintain contact with employees on parental leave and to 
 ensure a smooth return to work at the same level,  Volks wa gen 
 offers work options during parental leave, get-togethers for em-
ployees on parental leave and information events, such as the 
“Family Management and Career” seminars, run at the Wolfsburg 
plant. Audi, Porsche and MAN offer similar provision.
A Range of Childcare Provision
A further step on the way to becoming a family-friendly employer is 
the ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provision. The 
 Volks wa gen Group has found it beneficial to establish childcare 
facilities within or near the Company. At the  Volks wa gen locations 
in Wolfsburg, Hanover and Emden, additional nurseries have 
been set up near the plants in cooperation with the local authori-
ties, while MAN runs company kindergartens at its plants in 
 Munich and Augsburg.  Volks wa gen Financial Services AG’s 
“Frech Daxe” nursery in Braunschweig, meanwhile, is one of Ger-
many’s largest company nurseries.

 V EXAMPLES OF COMBINING WORK AND FAMILY
 Volks wa gen Group of America: Childcare provision has been of-
fered at the Chattanooga plant since January 2012, working with an 
 established regional provider to care for around 200 children. 
 Volks wa gen Slovakia: An initial get-together for employees on pa-
rental leave was organized in 2014. The idea is to keep employees 
involved with the company and to make it easier for them to return 
to work, for example by providing childcare, e-learning and flexible 
working.
 Volks wa gen Rus: 80 children of employees at the Kaluga location 
once again enjoyed a company-funded holiday camp in 2014.
 Volks wa gen Motor Polska and  Volks wa gen Pozna´n: The “Future 
Mother” programme allows women to work flexible hours or to 
 reduce their hours without loss of pay during pregnancy. 
Caring for Family Members
 Volks wa gen AG has a wide range of provision for time off to help its 
employees care for close family members. Employees have a right 
to take up to ten working days’ leave at short notice to organize 
 appropriate care. They may also take up to six months’ part-time or 
full-time leave to fulfil their caring responsibilities. Another 
 option is to work part-time for up to 24 months so as to be able to 
meet caring obligations.  Volks wa gen is particularly flexible in its 
commitment to re-employing workers who take extended leave; for 
the past 20 years or so, employees have been able to request up to 
eight years’ leave of absence without having to give reasons and 
have a guaranteed right to re-employment on their former terms 
and conditions. At Porsche, employees have been able to apply 
for time off to care for family members since March 1, 2014. In the 
event of care being urgently required within the family, they can 
take up to three months’ leave at 75% of their gross monthly pay. In 
this respect, Porsche goes well beyond the legal requirements, 
which do not envision any remuneration for this period. 
High Proportion of Employees with Disabilities
 Volks wa gen is particularly committed to helping employees with 
performance impairment or disabilities. People with disabilities 
made up 7.39% of the total workforce of  Volks wa gen AG in 2014 – 
once again, well above the statutory quota of 5%. 55% of employ-
ees with disabilities worked in the production sector and 45% in 
support functions.  Volks wa gen is also helping to boost employ-
ment for people with disabilities outside the Company: during the 
reporting year, it placed orders worth more than €20.9 million 
with workshops employing people with disabilities.  Volks wa gen 
mobility aids have also helped to give people with disabilities 
greater independence and autonomy.

The Company is also particularly committed to its perfor-
mance-impaired employees outside Germany. An example here is 
the six sheltered workshops that employ more than 200 people 
with disabilities at the ŠKODA production locations in the Czech 
Republic.  
Inclusion Agreement Signed
In July 2014, the Board of Management, the Works Council and 
the representatives of people with disabilities signed an inclusion 
agreement that applies across all Group brands and companies 
in Germany. This agreement makes inclusion an integral part of 
the corporate culture and focuses not on individuals’ supposed 
deficits but on their strengths and potential. The aims of the agree-
ment are as follows:
 >  People with disabilities are assigned meaningful roles and 
 responsibilities in which they can make optimal use of, and 
 develop, their strengths and potential and obtain recognition 
for their performance.
 > Young people with disabilities can pursue vocational education 
and training within the  Volks wa gen Group. Barriers to the 
 application process are progressively dismantled.
 > The topic of inclusion forms part of the corporate mind-set and is 
taken for granted in employees’ daily dealings with each other. 
Managers have an important part to play in promoting changes 
in attitudes: the necessary changes will come about only when 
people are well informed.
 > If the strategy is to be implemented sustainably, inclusion must 
be embedded in the agenda of all relevant committees.
 > Progress should be made in joint projects between the Company 
and the representatives of people with disabilities on boosting 
inclusion. Those involved will receive support from the Board of 
Management and employee representatives.
A working group is charged with implementing this agreement 
through various action areas and measures.
Equal Opportunities as a Matter of Principle
  Volks wa gen is committed to respect, tolerance and cosmopolitan-
ism. We guarantee equal opportunities and equal treatment irre-
spective of ethnicity, skin color, gender, disability, ideology, faith, 
nationality, sexual orientation, social background or political con-
viction, provided this is based on democratic principles and toler-
ance towards those who hold different views. The   Volks wa gen 
Group’s Code of Conduct underpins this aspiration across the 
Group, and every employee and member of an executive body has 
responsibility under the Code for ensuring that individuals work 
together in partnership and for notifying any breach of the Code 
without delay. If there is a breach of the Code, the Company may 
take appropriate action against an individual who is acting in a 
discriminatory way; sanctions range from a formal warning or 
 relocation to dismissal.
If an employee feels he or she is being discriminated against, the 
Company meets the statutory provisions for whistle-blowing but 
also provides access to trained personnel to support and advise the 
individual concerned. At the initiative of the Works Council, these 
rights and obligations were laid down in 1996 in the “Cooperative 
Conduct at the Workplace” works agreement for all  Volks wa gen AG 
employees and locations. This agreement was revised in 2007, and 
every new employee receives a copy when he or she is appointed. It 
is also covered in management training activities. 
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
For the   Volks wa gen Group, corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
has long since come to mean a commitment to local well-being be-
yond the factory gates. As well as promoting social, cultural and 
societal projects, we see ourselves as a source of economic impetus 
for local structural development and equal opportunities. We sup-
port some 200 projects worldwide designed to enhance economic 
and social structures, placing special emphasis on continuity and 
sustainability. Our aim is that employees, shareholders, the local 
population and customers should all benefit from what we do.
Our Priorities 
Our CSR priorities include support for future-oriented, education 
and social projects, primarily in the locations where the Group 
 operates. But we also offer rapid support to the victims of natural 
disasters and promote volunteering by our employees. The follow-
ing fundamental principles underpin our choice of CSR projects:
 >  The projects are in line with the Group’s Basic Principles and 
 address a specific local or regional issue. 
 > They reflect diversity within the Group and in the social environ-
ment in which the projects are sited. 
 > They involve a close stakeholder dialogue with actors on the 
ground, who are involved in carrying out the projects. 
 > Project management is based locally and overseen by local units.
Dr. Horst Neumann, Member of the Group Board of Management responsible 
for Personnel Management and Organization, Bernd Osterloh, Chairman  
of the Group Works Council, and Klaus Wenzel, Chairman of the representa-
tives of people with disabilities, sign a joint declaration on inclusion. 
73
Commitment to the Regions
We are committed to the regions in which our locations are based: 
a sustainable environment that is pleasant to live in gives a region 
the edge in competition for business, boosts local employees’ qual-
ity of life, and makes us more attractive as an employer. This is why, 
for example,  Volks wa gen AG supports regional growth initiatives 
in areas including education, health, leisure, energy and trans-
port, alongside a broad range of measures to promote business.
Wolfsburg AG, based within the Group headquarters in Wolfsburg 
(Germany), is a beacon in this respect. This public-private part-
nership with the City of Wolfsburg, launched in 1999, is involved 
in future-oriented projects focusing on the important topics of em-
ployment and quality of life. And this joint undertaking is proving 
very successful: in November 2013, Wolfsburg topped the table for 
economic growth in a survey of German towns and cities by the 
business magazine Wirtschaftswoche and scored very highly for 
tax revenue, productivity and women’s employment. And the en-
tire region now benefits from the work done to develop structures 
and local amenities: Wolfsburg AG works closely with the “Allianz 
für die Region GmbH”, or Regional Alliance, which takes in the 
towns of Wolfsburg, Braunschweig and Salzgitter and the sur-
rounding rural areas as well as regional businesses.
 V XINJIANG DOCTORS GO WEST
Partnering with the Xinjiang Medical University and the Xinjiang 
Medical University Hospital,  Volks wa gen China is supporting an ex-
change program called “Xinjiang doctors go West”. As part of Chi-
na’s support for infrastructure in the west of the country, this pro-
gram both provides a platform for participating doctors to share 
experience and offers bursaries to young medical students.
Educational Initiatives
In addition to regional infrastructure projects,  Volks wa gen AG is 
also actively involved in education in the region. The “Neue Schule 
Wolfsburg” project, an initiative to set up a new school in Wolfs-
burg in partnership with the city and local businesses, opened its 
doors in August 2009. This primary and secondary school, which 
is open to all children from the City of Wolfsburg and the sur-
rounding region, designs its curriculum around five key themes: 
a strong international focus, science and technology, business, the 
arts, and the promotion of talent. The school has a total of 688 
 students enrolled in the 2014/2015 academic year. In Ingolstadt, 
meanwhile, Germany’s first integrated school (Profilschule) 
opened its doors in September 2014 with support from Audi. Its 
motto is “Kein Talent verlieren” (“Fostering every talent”), and this 
unique beacon project offers children and young people with diffi-
cult backgrounds educational support at primary and secondary 
levels. The project resulted from collaboration between the Bavar-
ian Ministry of Education, the City of Ingolstadt, the Roland-Berg-
er Foundation and Audi. Education is also a key area of involve-
ment in the regions in which  Volks wa gen operates around the 
world.  Volks wa gen South Africa, for example, supports the nation-
wide Nal’ibali reading campaign, which has so far set up 272 read-
ing clubs.   Volks wa gen Group China, meanwhile, runs a bursary 
scheme that enables students at Xinjiang University to participate 
in academic exchanges in Germany.  
 V PLANT-FOR-THE-PLANET
The “Plant-for-the-Planet” initiative launched by school student 
 Felix Finkbeiner aims to reduce levels of carbon dioxide in the 
 atmosphere by planting trees. The aim is to plant some 1,000 billion 
trees by 2020. On the initiative of the Works Council,  Volks wa gen is 
supporting this project which has also been recognized by the Ger-
man UNESCO Commission. The program includes academies for 
children and young people at which they learn key facts about 
 climate change and global fairness and have the chance to take part 
in a tree-planting event. Almost all  Volks wa gen locations in Germa-
ny have already hosted such academies and plant-a-tree events and 
these activities will be continued over the long term.  
We also use our expertise in mobility and road safety in school edu-
cation projects. Just one of many examples from companies within 
the Group is the “Parque Polo”, an area providing road safety 
training through play for children and sited in the grounds of the 
 Volks wa gen Navarra plant (Pamplona, Spain) which was opened 
more than ten years ago. In 2014, 8,522 children aged between 5 
and 15 visited the Parque, taking the total number of visitors to 
114,268.
 V HELP FOR FLOOD VICTIMS IN THE BALKANS
After the disastrous floods that hit large parts of Bosnia-Herzegovi-
na, Serbia and Croatia in May 2014, the  Volks wa gen Group sent 
€100,000 in emergency aid to the German Red Cross to support its 
work in the region. The money was used to provide victims with 
emergency supplies and to help with reconstruction.
Volunteering Welcome
Responsibility, respect and a long-term commitment are pillars of 
our personnel management work within the  Volks wa gen Group 
and benefit our employees, not least by boosting their social and 
crossfunctional skills. That is why we actively support our employ-
ees in volunteering through our “ Volks wa gen pro Ehrenamt” 
(“ Volks wa gen Supports Volunteering”) initiative, which is embed-
ded in the personnel management function. The initiative focuses 
on sport, culture, education and society, but we also offer rapid 
support to the victims of natural disasters. For example, we can 
quickly release employees from their regular duties to assist in

the aftermath of a natural disaster. The “  Volks wa gen pro Ehren-
amt” function also supports all Group companies in implementing 
this framework concept. Our volunteering database enables the 
function to match volunteers with demand and to provide relevant 
information. By the end of 2104, the initiative had placed some 
2,034 employees in volunteer roles, and similar programs have 
now been introduced at other Group companies, including Audi, 
MAN, Porsche and ŠKODA.
 V  Employees with an interest in volun-
teering have access to 2,041 opportuni­
ties with more than 570 organizations 
through the  Volks wa gen volunteering 
database.
Senior Experts Benefit the Community
All employees looking for a new challenge once they have retired can 
volunteer with the “ Volks wa gen pro Ehrenamt” in-house “Senior 
Experts” scheme. This initiative offers them an opportunity to serve 
the community regionally or globally, for example, by passing on 
their know-how within the Company or as an adviser to external 
 organizations. In 2014, 219 Senior Experts were able to choose 
whether, where and on which projects they wanted to put their spe-
cialist knowledge and skills to good use. Among other benefits, this 
valuable exchange of experience between older and younger people 
means that former employees maintain their links with the 
  Volks wa gen Group while both sides boost their knowledge and skills.
 V CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WEEK OF ACTION
 Volks wa gen supports the voluntary activities of its employees and 
aims to foster a wider awareness in society of the importance of 
voluntary commitments that advance social causes. As a coopera-
tion partner to the German National Network for Civil Society (BBE), 
in 2014  Volks wa gen pro Ehrenamt for the first time opened the 
10th nationwide Civic Engagement Week of Action. During panel 
discussions on the topic of “Corporate Social Responsibility and En-
gagement” insight was provided into the voluntary activities of the 
Group and its employees.
The  Volks wa gen pro Ehrenamt in-house “Senior Experts” initiative offers an opportunity to serve the community regionally or globally by passing on know-how 
within the Company or as a volunteer adviser to external organizations.

The   Volks wa gen Employees’ Foundation
The   Volks wa gen Employees’ Foundation was set up in 2011 as a 
charitable foundation by  Volks wa gen AG with the aim of promot-
ing initial, continuing and vocational training, education, and 
support for young people, with a particular focus on improving the 
living conditions of children and young people regardless of their 
origin, background or religion. To achieve this effectively, the 
  Volks wa gen Employees’ Foundation restricts its activities to areas 
surrounding the Group’s locations worldwide. 
Since 2011, the  Volks wa gen Employees’ Foundation has launched or 
supported ten projects in Germany and elsewhere. In Portugal, for 
example, it supports the “Tu importas” (“You count”) project, a three-
year training program for socially disadvantaged young people.
Fairtrade
At the suggestion of the General Works Council,  Volks wa gen AG 
has been supporting the sale of TransFair-branded products in its 
catering facilities via its catering provider, Service Factory Gas-
tronomie und Hotellerie, since 1999. This helps producers in de-
veloping countries to earn a decent living. In 2014, total consump-
tion of fairly traded coffee rose 23.7%, to 60 t. And since 2012, 
  Volks wa gen has also been selling fairly traded craft items: produc-
ers in Madagascar use recycled cans to produce models based on 
iconic  Volks wa gen vehicles.

Company Donations
The  Volks wa gen Group’s commitment to donations and sponsor-
ship is a key part of our corporate identity and reflects our desire to 
fulfil our corporate social responsibility. We support a wide range 
of organizations and events around the world. The principles un-
derpinning donations and sponsorship are governed by our 
Group-wide Code of Conduct, which stipulates that we give dona-
tions in cash and in kind for activities and projects primarily devot-
ed to research and education, culture and sport, and social causes. 
Donations are granted only to organizations recognized to be 
non-profit or that are authorized by special provisions to accept 
donations.  Volks wa gen does not donate to political parties, par-
ty-affiliated foundations or representatives of the political arena. 
Over the reporting year,  Volks wa gen AG donated a total of €14 mil-
lion. Along with social organizations, in 2014 the main beneficiar-
ies of donations were the victims of major natural disasters.
Employee Donations
In 2014, employees of  Volks wa gen AG alone donated more than €4 
million to good causes. Employee donations represent a major con-
tribution by  Volks wa gen AG companies and their employees to 
those in need in locations where the Company operates. Employee 
donations support specific projects, such as those that improve the 
lives of people whose quality of life is reduced by illness, disability 
or other circumstances. Our goal is to offer support to those who 
are disadvantaged and to boost social cohesion: for example, we 
support the “Starthilfe” (Getting Started) project, which helps so-
cially disadvantaged children and young people and improves the 
lives and prospects of young people in the Wolfsburg region. In the 
“One Hour for the Future” campaign,  Volks wa gen and Audi 
 employees donate an hour’s pay to help street children. Since the 
summer of 2003, this initiative has also included the collection of

Our Global Engagement 
The   Volks wa gen Group supports some 200 projects promoting 
social development, the arts and culture, education, regional 
structural development, health and sport, as well as nature 
conservation. When deciding which social projects to support 
and partnerships to enter into, we don’t take a scattershot ap-
proach but consider whether they make a good match for our 
corporate focus on mobility or are located in the vicinity of our 
production locations and benefit the people who work there or 
live locally. At all of our brands and in every region in the world 
of   Volks wa gen, living up to our social responsibilities is at the 
core of our corporate culture. On the Internet you will find a

 V INTERVIEW
WHEN IT COMES TO SUSTAINABILITY,  
YOU CAN NEVER DO ENOUGH
An interview with Bernd Osterloh,  
Chairman of the General and Group Works Council 
The  Volks wa gen Works Council fosters, even initiates, its own 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. Why is that? Isn’t 
 CSR usually a management function?
Osterloh: Social responsibility isn’t something you can leave to 
others. We believe that everyone has a responsibility to get 
 involved. And you can’t just talk the talk – you have to walk the 
walk. Sixteen years ago, for example, the Group Works Council 
launched the “One hour for the future” campaign. We partner 
with the children’s and adolescents’ charity “terre des hommes” 
to help street children worldwide. Over the years, we have spon-
sored more than 130 projects in six countries. And since 2010 
we’ve also had a special project called “A chance to play”. At the 
two FIFA World Cup tournaments in South Africa and Brazil, we 
made sure that more than 100,000 socially disadvantaged 
 children could participate in games, sports and educational 
 activities. But we are also aware that child poverty is an issue 
right on our own doorstep. To address this problem, we 
launched the “Starthilfe” (Getting Started) initiative. It sponsors 
projects targeting nutrition, education, physical fitness and 
   social development in nursery and elementary schools.
The “ Volks wa gen Belegschaftsstiftung” ( Volks wa gen Employ-
ees’ Foundation) provides a special example of how employees 
live out their commitment to social responsibility. Are there 
 projects here that are especially close to your heart?
Osterloh: The  Volks wa gen Employees’ Foundation was estab-
lished in 2011.  The foundation has taken up the work of our 
former children’s relief projects. The focus has always been 
on socially disadvantaged children and young people in the 
 Volks wa gen Group’s locations around the globe. We are aim-
ing to give them the chance to shape a successful future for 
themselves. You can well imagine that every single one of 
these projects is important to me, because every project 
has a worthy goal. One hundred apprenticeships in Portugal, 
 establishing a vocational training center in India, vocational 
training projects in Brazil and Argentina, aid for recent gradu-
ates in  Italy – the list goes on and on. Each project is a priority; 
each project is close to my heart. 
 
Why does the Works Council consider sustainability and 
 social responsibility so important for a global corporation like 
 Volks wa gen? Do you think the Company is already doing 
enough to reach its ambitious objective of being the most 
  sustainable company in the industry? 
Osterloh: It is important to fight poverty, protect nature and 
promote the arts. These are obligations to our society that no 
one, including companies, can ignore.  Volks wa gen internalized 
these priorities years ago and can justly be called a pioneer in 
many areas. But my honest answer to your question is that 
when it comes to sustainability, you can never do enough – and 
I am certain that our management understands this as well. 
 V  It is important to fight poverty, protect 
nature and promote the arts.
Employee co-determination plays an important role in the 
 Volks wa gen Group. The Group Works Council is pursuing the 
goal of establishing employee representation bodies at its 
 locations outside Germany as well. What benefits can be 
 gained by this approach? Where do things currently stand? 
Osterloh: Strong employee co-determination is one of the reasons 
that  Volks wa gen is such a successful company today. Today no-
body disputes this fact. We have a model of co-determination that 
works very well in Germany, and what we are trying to do is identi-
fy the elements that can be applied in our locations elsewhere. Be 
it in India, Brazil or Portugal – the local background conditions are 
very different, and of course we have to take them into account. In 
any case, our top priority remains representing the interests of our 
79
colleagues vis-à-vis management. To accomplish this, we need 
well-defined structures and binding rules – which of course can 
be different depending on the situation. The most important 
thing is making certain that the employees’ wishes and needs 
don’t  disappear from the radar.  Volks wa gen understands this, 
which is why our Company is working to become the best employ-
er. And I consider this a very worthwhile goal.
 V   Strong employee co­determination is 
one of the reasons that  Volks wa gen is such 
a successful company today.
 
The automobile industry is going through a sea change. Digiti-
zation won’t just leave its mark on the cars of the future, but 
on the world of work as well. What are the biggest challenges 
facing the  Volks wa gen Group? What can the employees  expect 
 to happen?
Osterloh: Digitization is hardly a new phenomenon. And this is not 
the first major change that the automotive world has experienced. 
Whenever there is change, there are both opportunities and risks. 
Of course digitization means that workflows and processes will 
change. As the Works Council, it is our job to shape these changes 
to the advantage of the workforce. It’s not about stopping  progress 
or acting as a roadblock. It’s about leveraging the full potential of 
digitization. For example, digitization goes hand in hand with 
questions of ergonomics and autonomy. The way we work tomor-
row has to be better than today. If we succeed in making it so, then 
we will have accomplished something worthwhile. 
 V  The way we work tomorrow has to be 
better than today.
 
With the aim of meeting new challenges, the  Volks wa gen 
Group has committed itself to a strict efficiency program. Do 
you believe this endangers the corporate objectives of job 
  security and social responsibility? 
Osterloh: No, what makes you think that? The efficiency program 
will have precisely the opposite effect. It will safeguard long-term 
employment. Our Chairman of the Board of Management, Profes-
sor Dr. Martin Winterkorn, hasn’t simply prescribed a program of 
cost cutting. We’re aiming to make processes throughout the 
Company more efficient, which also means more cost-effective.
The employees have understood this from the outset, which is 
why they have set a good example. We presented Dr. Winterkorn 
with a folder containing more than 500 specific proposals which 
come directly from the workforce. And more proposals are still 
coming in. After all, our colleagues are the ones who know best 
where  Volks wa gen has unexploited reserves and opportunities 
waiting to be leveraged. In fact, I can think of some managers who 
I wish were tackling the efficiency program with the same energy 
that we are. We’re talking about a responsibility that must be 
shouldered – responsibility for cost-effectiveness and job security 
within the  Volks wa gen Group.
 V  We’re talking about a responsibility that 
must be shouldered.

“When the wind of change blows, some build walls and 
others build windmills,” says an old Chinese proverb. 
This makes the perfect match for our  Volks wa gen 
 Efficiency Strategy. The world is changing fast, and in 
China the clocks run even a little bit faster than else-
where. China is facing big new challenges. More pros-
perity, coupled with a careful management of resourc-
es. More innovation, also triggered by the digital 
revolution. And – of course – a sound environment for 
everybody: these are cornerstones of China’s path to 
 reform. And they precisely reflect our ambition for the 
future, too. 
The Chinese government sets the course for new eco- 
friendly technologies and sustainable behavior. The 
guideline to reduce CO2 emissions in China to a fleet fuel 
consumption of 5l, is even more challenging than the 
95g/km target for 2020 set by the European Union. The 
explanation is very simple: in China only 1 % of cars have 
a diesel engine and there is a preference for more spa-
cious vehicles which naturally are heavier. The answer to 
this challenge can only be a holistic approach. We have 
to think in terms of all possible technical solutions, in-
cluding sophisticated vehicle and powertrain measures 
as well as alternative drive systems. 
First of all, we need to better protect the environment 
and further reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the 
 future. In this context, the development of electric  
vehicles plays a key role. At the same time, other issues 
also need to be considered. For example, the Chinese 
government has stated that carbon dioxide emissions 
should peak in 2030 before beginning to fall, which 
means that all sources of emissions need to get in-
volved in the process of reducing the carbon footprint, 
including energy suppliers, households and various 
industries such as the auto industry. More Chinese 
cities are expected to restrict vehicle registrations in 
the future, as has already happened for example in 
Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou. This will drive up 
demand for new-energy vehicles especially in these 
megacities.
On the subject of plug-in hybrid as a focus of the  
 Volks wa gen Group for developing new-energy vehicles in 
China, I think we should be aware that plug-in hybrid 
 power is the best solution in the short and medium term. 
Perhaps the development of all-electric vehicles can be 
realized in the long run. Discussions are ongoing in 
this respect also with Chinese experts. We need to find 
solutions to facilitate the development of highly effi-

cient batteries. And at component level we need to con-
sider how to further improve energy conservation in both 
conventionally powered and electric models. 
From the perspective of standards it is also very impor-
tant to establish an electric vehicle charging standard. 
Our plug-in hybrids do not require special charging 
 facilities and they can easily be charged over night at or-
dinary household sockets. However, when we consider 
all-electric vehicles, a fast-charging infrastructure 
should first be put in place. So for the future of electric 
mobility it is essential that common standards for fast 
charging should be defined immediately. China has not 
established any unified standard in this regard so far. 
Currently, for example, you cannot drive an all-electric 
vehicle from Beijing to Shanghai and rely on charging 
along the way. This is because the infrastructure has 
not been completed yet – and even once it is, the stand-
ard may not be universal. To this end, we need dependa-
ble, stable technologies. This way, in the future we 
can channel our development investments in the right 
 direction and contribute towards advancing plug-in 
 hybrid technologies.
There is no doubt that the research and development of 
new electric vehicles is a key pillar to address CO2 re-
duction from the perspective of the automotive indus-
try. So it is to be welcomed that the Chinese government 
gives strong support to the market development of new 
electric vehicles by specific regulations and subsidies. 
And we are pleased to see that the recent policy initia-
tives start showing impact looking at the growth of the 
new energy vehicles production volume in 2014. I am 
convinced that with joint efforts we go step by step in 
the right direction – to reach the big goal of sustainable 
mobility in China.
The biggest challenge confronting  Volks wa gen is cost. 
For the time being, electric vehicle technologies are very 
costly, so customers need to obtain a government subsidy 
in order to purchase an electric vehicle. For one thing, 
battery technology costs need to be further reduced; for 
another, costs can also be reduced by increasing quanti-
ties or through volume production. We expect future elec-
tric vehicles to achieve the same price levels as conven-
tional models. Thanks to our modular toolkit strategy 
we are able to electrify nearly every model in our range – 
to meet the local consumers’ needs in all segments and 
classes.
 Volks wa gen is “electrifying” China with a tailor-made 
new electric vehicle strategy. In the near future, we will 
be offering Chinese customers an impressive choice of 
over twenty electric vehicles – from small cars to large 
sedans and SUVs, from plug-in hybrids to all-electric 
drives. We cannot allow the electric car to be a compro-
mise on wheels. It has to be perfect in every way – tech-
nically  mature, practical, safe and affordable.
Prof. Dr. Jochem Heizmann 
Member of the Group Board of Management,  
with responsibility for ‘China’
“The development of 
electric vehicles plays a 
key role.”
“We cannot allow the 
electric car to be a 
 compromise on wheels.”

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 
Climate change, resource availability and urbanization are just 
some of the major global challenges facing the  Volks wa gen Group 
from an environmental perspective. These challenges are reflect-
ed in growing demands from all sides, be it politicians who enforce 
ambitious worldwide environmental regulations, investors who 
expect us to anticipate and manage the risks, or customers with 
their growing interest in fuel-efficient vehicles.
 V  The  Volks wa gen Group has a long 
tradition of resolute commitment to 
environmental protection.
The  Volks wa gen Group has a long tradition of resolute commit-
ment to environmental protection. The new Environmental 
Strategy adopted by the Group Board of Management in 2013 
provides the framework for addressing these challenges with 
specific targets and measures, and improving environmental 
protection within the Group. Implementation of the Group-
wide Environmental Strategy is binding and measurable across 
the brands and business units at every stage of the value chain, 
from product planning and development, to supplier manage-
ment, logistics and production, through to sales, marketing 
and recycling.  
The  Volks wa gen Group has defined four overarching target 
 areas:
 >  Leader in environmentally friendly products: We firmly 
 believe that eco-friendly products should never compromise 
on world-class technology, comfort and safety. One of our key 
goals is to cut CO2 emissions from our European new car fleet 
to  95 g/km by 2020, to reduce fuel consumption by between 10 
and 15% in each new model compared with its predecessor, to 
have the lowest fuel consumption levels in every vehicle class 
(for the  Volks wa gen brand), to expand our range of alternative 
powertrains, to achieve top rankings, ratings and awards for 
selected products, and to become the market leaders in electric 
mobility by 2018.
 > No. 1 for lifecycle-wide resource conservation: We consider 
the environmental impacts of our products, particularly their 
CO2 emissions, at every stage of their life cycle. Along with 
 climate protection, the main objective of this approach is to 
conserve finite resources. Our measures center on efficient 
product and process design, the use of innovative environ-
mental technologies, and sustainable energy supplies. For this 
reason, we not only aim for every vehicle to better the environ-
mental performance of its predecessor over its entire life cycle, 
but also target the significant reduction of our environmental 
footprint by 2018. Specifically, we are aiming for 25% reduc-
tions in energy and water consumption, CO2 and solvent emis-
sions and waste for disposal per manufactured unit compared 
with 2010.
 > No. 1 for intelligent mobility: Intelligent mobility brings  together 
our pursuit of mobility and comfort, environmental protection 
and efficient transport. We aim for high levels of customer satis-
faction and want to be perceived as the most eco-friendly auto-
maker. Our principal strategies for achieving these aims  include 
intelligent, networked vehicles, new, supplementary business 
models and services, accompanied by initiatives for transport, 
 urban planning and social change.

goals. Our Environmental Strategy embraces all of our brands and regions, and extends through-
out every stage of the value chain.

 > Anchored throughout the Company: We want every indi-
vidual in our well-informed, qualified workforce to be active-
ly involved. Our strength lies in combining the expertise and 
competence of our brands and regions. Environmental con-
siderations are factored into every decision we make. We will 
motivate and qualify our employees even more intensively to 
meet our environmental targets.
To firmly anchor this philosophy throughout the Group, we need 
the involvement of every business unit at every stage of the value 
chain. This holistic, modular approach entails defining our own 
measurable goals for each module, which will help us to achieve 
our corporate objective of becoming the world’s most sustainable 
automaker. We have set up Group-wide committee and reporting 
structures to manage these topics, and systematically share best 
practice examples in a global network.
Environmental Policy
Environmental protection in the  Volks wa gen Group rests on the fol-
lowing global principles, which are binding for all Group brands:
 >  Group Environmental Policy (1995). 
 30
 >  Group Environmental Principles Production (2007). 
 31
 >  Group Environmental Principles Product (2008). 
 32
 >  Mission Statement on Biodiversity (2008). 
 33
All those responsible at Group headquarters, within the 
brands and at the locations observe these environmental prin-
ciples in every decision they take. The environmental policies 
and targets of the brands are derived from these principles. 
(See “Environmental Programs and Initiatives of the Brands”, 
page  89.)
Organization of Environmental Protection  
within the Group
The Group Board of Management is the highest decision-making 
authority on environmental matters. Since 2012, it has simulta-
neously acted as the Group’s Sustainability Board. The Group 
Chief Officer for the Environment, Energy and New Business 
 Areas, a post established in 2011, heads up the Corporate 
 Environmental and Energy Steering Group and reports to the 
Sustainability Board. The Steering Group is made up of repre-
sentatives from all Group divisions as well as from the Group 
Works Council, brands and companies, and meets four times a 
year. Other Group-wide committees, such as the CO2 Steering 
Group, the Vehicle Recycling Steering Group and the Corporate 
Working Group “Life  Cycle Engineering”, address a range of 
 specialist issues. The brands and companies are responsible for 
environmental organization at their headquarters and locations.
 V  We want every individual in our 
 well-informed, qualified workforce  
to be actively involved.
Environmental Officers at our European locations have convened 
regularly since 1976 to share their knowledge and experience. Regu-
lar Group Environmental Conferences were introduced in 1998 as a 
forum for the Group’s Environmental Officers and experts to discuss 
strategies, measures and projects, and draw up joint action plans.

 V ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION AT AUDI
The Board of Management has overall responsibility for operational 
environmental protection at Audi, while the Production Board is 
 responsible for implementing environmental policy. The Environ-
mental Protection unit, responsible for defining environmental pro-
tection activities in the Audi Group, reports to the Production 
Board. The Environmental Management Officers at AUDI AG and its 
locations and subsidiaries (including Lamborghini and Ducati) make 
up the “Coordinating Committee for Environmental Protection”, 
which issues recommendations on strategic environmental issues. 
The cross-functional Ecology Steering Committee is tasked with im-
plementing the mandates of the Coordinating Committee, among 
other things.
Operational environmental protection at the locations is the re-
sponsibility of the local Environmental Protection Officers. Their 
brief is to maintain and continuously improve the environmental 
compatibility of all activities at the respective Audi locations. Con-
sequently, the Operational Environmental Protection unit is actively 
involved in all environmentally relevant decisions and activities at 
the locations.
Building on the Group Environmental Policy and Environmental 
Principles, all brands organize their own environmental manage-
ment systems autonomously in line with international standards, 
be it the European Union’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme 
(EMAS) or the International Standards for Environmental Man-
agement (ISO 14001) and Energy Management (ISO 50001).
As per the end of 2014, out of a total of 106 Group production sites, 
90 held a valid ISO 14001 certificate (see table). Alongside the 
 Volks wa gen brand’s production locations, Audi, Lamborghini and 
Porsche have also had their factories’ energy management systems 
certified to the relatively new standard ISO 50001, and others will 
be following suit in the near future.  Volks wa gen brand production 
locations in Germany (passenger cars and commercial vehicles) 
have participated in EMAS since as long ago as 1995, and publish 
annual environmental statements which are validated by an envi-
ronmental auditor. 
 34 In 1996, the  Volks wa gen brand became 
the first automaker in the world to introduce an environmental 
management system certified to ISO 14001, for the  “development 
of motor vehicles with continuously improved  environmental 
properties” in its Technical Development department. In 2009, 
the “integration of environmental aspects into product develop-
ment for the  Volks wa gen brand” was likewise certified to 
ISO TR 14062 – another first for the industry. Both were recently 
recertified in 2013, and now have valid certificates until the end 
of 2016.

Engaging the Workforce, Living our Principles,  
Inspiring Others
Informing and engaging our employees is particularly impor-
tant to us as a Group. We have created an intranet portal to show-
case best practice examples and facilitate direct contact with the 
 relevant colleagues. The portal also outlines basic guidelines 
and  energy-saving tips, including some generated by the central 
 ideas management system. A “Works Agreement on Environ-
mental Protection” has been in place at the  Volks wa gen AG facto-
ries since 1995, and was most recently updated in 2013.
 V  Environmental programs anchored 
within the Group brands. 
Since 2010, the international umbrella brand “Think Blue.” has 
encapsulated the sustainability philosophy of the  Volks wa gen 
and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicle brands, which aims to 
 balance the need for personal mobility with environmental 
awareness. “Think Blue.” is much more than just products and 
technologies. It is designed to inspire and motivate employees, 
customers and the general public, and cooperates with environ-
mental organizations around the world. Since 2010, “Think 
Blue.” has continuously evolved throughout every stage of the 
value chain in all  Volks wa gen brand-related business units, and 
in 2014 was extended to car dealerships in Germany. The central 
components of the “Think Blue.” philosophy are: 
 >  Think Blue. Engineering. Since late 2012, this strategy has 
brought together all programs and measures aimed at continu-
ously improving the environmental performance of new models, 
based on the Environmental Goals of the Technical Develop-
ment department (see page 94).
 >  Think Blue. Factory. is a program launched by the  Volks wa gen 
brand in 2011, which aims to reduce consumption of energy and 
water, the volume of waste for disposal, solvent emissions and 
CO2 emissions per unit produced by 25% at all our factories 
worldwide by 2018 compared with 2010 levels (see page 100).
 >  Think Blue. Dealer. is an initiative to address energy efficiency 
in areas other than production. By 2018, the aim is to advise 
up to 60% of dealers worldwide on energy efficiency-related 
matters (see page 107).

 V  ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES OF THE BRANDS
Audi: In 2014 the Board of Management of AUDI AG chose “ultra” as 
the brand’s leitmotiv for pioneering sustainability topics. As a re-
sult, “ultra” now stands for the aim of forging a close link between 
our core brand message “Vorsprung durch Technik” and sustainabil-
ity, and is the banner under which the concrete sustainability activi-
ties are bundled. 
 38
Bentley: The “Bentley Environmental Factory” program has a five-
year plan to reduce the environmental footprint of each vehicle by 
25% by 2018. 
 39
Lamborghini: The Environmental Strategy aims to make the brand’s 
only location in Sant’Agata Bolognese (Italy) climate-neutral by the 
end of 2015. 
 40
MAN: The MAN Climate Strategy sets the target of reducing abso-
lute CO2 emissions at its production locations by 25% by 2020 com-
pared to a 2008 baseline. Because MAN joined the  Volks wa gen 
Group in 2012, its Climate Strategy, adopted in 2011, differs from 
the  Volks wa gen Group’s Environmental and Sustainability Strategy, 
which has a target date of 2018. 
 41
Porsche: Porsche’s environmental efforts center around efficiency, 
including the continuous improvement of environmental and ener-
gy management systems at its locations, as well as a commitment 
to making each new generation of vehicles around 20% more effi-
cient. 
 42
Scania: At Scania, the concept for reducing energy consumption and 
CO2 emissions is called “Ecolution by Scania”. 
 43
SEAT: “ECOMOTIVE” is the name of SEAT’s comprehensive environ-
mental program. ECOMOTIVE FACTORY is an umbrella term for all 
environmental measures associated with manufacturing processes. 
Among other things, the program aims to become a pioneering 
force for environmental protection in vehicle manufacturing by 
2018, in line with the corporate objectives. 
 44
ŠKODA: The brand combines its environmental activities under the 
strategy umbrella “GreenFuture”. Its three pillars – GreenProduct, 
GreenFactory and GreenRetail – center on the sustainable manu-
facturing and marketing of increasingly eco-friendly cars.

ENVIRONMENT
GROUP-WIDE PROGRAMS
The high pressure to innovate and the growing demands placed 
on the automotive industry by CO2 legislation necessitate high 
levels of expenditure on research and development. In 2014, the 
 Volks wa gen Group invested €11.5 billion in research and devel-
opment. This expenditure is set to increase over the next few 
years: between 2015 and 2019, the  Volks wa gen Group Auto-
motive Division is planning to invest around €85.6 billion in new 
models, innovative technologies and its global presence. Around 
two-thirds of all investments are dedicated to more efficient 
 vehicles, alternative powertrains and more environmentally 
compatible production. The investment program has earmarked 
€21.9 billion for development work alone. The total investment 
sum of €85.6 billion does not include our joint ventures in China, 
which will be investing a further €22.0 billion in new factories 
and products between 2015 and 2019, financed from their own 
funds.   
Climate Protection Strategy
Climate protection is at the heart of the Group’s environmental 
management philosophy, spanning every stage of the value crea-
tion process. We report regularly on our climate protection strate-
gy to the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), 
a consortium of institutional investors. In 2014, the  Volks wa gen 
Group was again awarded 99 out of a possible 100 points for its 
transparency, and a top grade of A for its performance (see page 
49), as well as being listed in both Leadership Indices.
Absolute CO2 emissions from our in-house energy generation at 
production locations (Scope 1) and from purchased energy (Scope 
2) increased slightly in recent years, whilst specific emissions (in 
kg per vehicle) have fallen. This can be explained by the increase 
in production volume, coupled with an increase in the volume of 
purchased energy (see Indicators). One of the Group’s key envi-
ronmental targets is to reduce specific energy consumption per 
vehicle during production by 25% by 2018 (compared with the 
REBOUND EFFECT
ARE THE BENEFITS OF GREATER EFFICIENCY BEING EATEN UP BY GROWTH?
Cars are becoming increasingly fuel-efficient. Producing them is becoming more energy-efficient. As a rule, 
 however, this progress doesn’t lead to an absolute drop in consumption if the companies concerned and 
their  markets are simultaneously growing. The benefits of greater efficiency, so the argument runs, are entirely 
or at least  partially eaten up. So how can a growth strategy be compatible with responsible management? 
 Volks wa gen is growing fast – unit sales are up 40 percent 
over 2010, sales revenue has moved ahead 60 percent, while 
the workforce has expanded from under 400,000 to almost 
600,000 employees. Over the same period we have managed to 
cut CO2 emissions per vehicle built by 23 percent, while in 
 absolute terms they have increased by roughly 6 percent.
A glance at the use phase shows that, thanks to innovative 
 engineering, our vehicles are becoming increasingly efficient, 
 witness the drop in our EU corporate average fleet emissions 
to around 126 g CO2/km. Making each new model significantly 
more fuel-efficient than its predecessor is one of our corporate 
goals. Apart from which we also encourage our customers to 
adopt as economical a style of driving as possible – and offer 
free courses to help them do so, not least in conjunction with 
NABU.
 Volks wa gen’s strategy is not about growth at all costs. It’s 
about sustainable growth. Restricting corporate growth is 
 alien to any competitive system. In fact it’s inherent to compe-
tition to conquer new markets by offering superior solutions, 
by offering innovations. We leverage innovations to make not 
only our products but also our production processes even 
more efficient. 
  Volks wa gen aims to develop and sell the world’s most efficient 
cars. In this we square up to the global competition. As eco-
nomic history has shown many times over, there are no inno-
vations without growth and competition. Dispensing with 
growth is irreconcilable with a responsible corporate strategy 
that targets a balance between ecological, economic and social 
sustainability.

base year 2010), and to cut specific CO2 emissions by the same 
amount. 
For our German locations, which currently account for around 
45% of our Group-wide CO2 emissions from production, the 
 Volks wa gen Group has set itself an even more ambitious target: 
CO2 emissions from energy supplies in Germany are to be reduced 
by 40% by 2020 compared with 2010. We aim to achieve this by 
improving energy efficiency, partially replacing coal with gas in 
our in-house energy production, and purchasing electricity from 
renewable sources. We are urgently awaiting a clear political 
framework for the energy industry in order to make further invest-
ments in power station conversion measures.
 V GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY TOOL (SCOPE 3)
Alongside production-related energy consumption, the fuel con-
sumption of our fleet is another key consideration. Since 2012, the 
 Volks wa gen Group has published a so-called Scope 3 Inventory for 
CO2 Emissions (see page 128), corresponding to the Scope 3 Stand-
ard of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute (WRI). The Inventory 
analyzes CO2 emissions generated outside the factory gates, for 
 example in the supply chain, and in the use and disposal of vehicles. 
Other examples of emission sources covered by the Scope 3 Inven-
tory include logistics processes and business trips. The wider scope

of this analysis poses a number of major challenges for companies 
in terms of both data collation and interpretation. The  Volks wa gen 
Group is one of the forerunners here and collates data in 12 out of 
the 15 Scope 3 categories.
Our data indicates that the emission category “Purchased goods 
and services” accounts for around 17% of the total Scope 3 Invento-
ry, and the “Use phase” 75%. The data from both these categories is 
validated by external auditors. The Inventory reveals that our most 
effective lever for cutting CO2 emissions is the development of 
more  fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Powertrain and Fuel Strategy
Continuous fuel efficiency improvements for our gasoline and 
diesel engines, a range of CNG vehicles and further electrifica-
tion of the model portfolio – these are the cornerstones of the 
 Volks wa gen Group’s Powertrain and Fuel Strategy (for further 
details see Product Development, pages 94 – 99). According to 
the Center of Automotive Management, the  Volks wa gen Group is 
now the world’s leading powertrain innovator (see page 37). Our 
Powertrain and Fuel Strategy also aims to replace fossil fuels 
with renewables, as part of our long-term goal of achieving 
 carbon-neutral mobility.
Today, most of our customers across the world still opt for conven-
tionally powered vehicles. So for a long time to come, electrified 
 Volks wa gen delivered the first XL1• in May 2014. With test cycle fuel consumption of 0.9 l/100 km, this is the world’s first “1-liter” car.

powertrains and conventional internal combustion engines will 
continue to coexist as parallel technologies. However, this techno-
logical diversity will be accompanied by a steady increase in the use 
of carbon-neutral fuels, for example in the form of renewable 
 electricity for electric vehicles, or next-generation biofuels – most 
notably biomethane from organic waste, and synthetic natural gas.
 V  The  Volks wa gen Group is the world’s 
leading powertrain innovator.
“Power-to-gas” storage of renewable electricity in the form of 
synthetic hydrocarbons is a sustainable energy technology 
whose importance extends far beyond the automotive industry. 
The Audi e-gas plant in Werlte (Germany) – the world’s first in-
dustrial power-to-gas plant – was connected to the grid in 2013. 
This plant produces methane from a chemical process involving 
wind power, CO2 and water. As far as possible, the electricity is 
used at times when the grid has surplus supply, and when wind 
turbines, for example, would normally have to be shut down. 
This surplus green power is first used to split water molecules 
into oxygen and hydrogen. At some point in the future it may be 
possible to use this hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles. However, the 
large-scale hydrogen storage, distribution and refueling infra-
structure this will require has yet to be developed. At the present 
time therefore, the second step in the process is methanation, 
whereby the hydrogen reacts with CO2 to produce synthetic 
methane. The resulting Audi “e-gas” meets the same quality 
standards as fossil-based natural gas. The Werlte plant has been 
feeding this gas to the German grid since autumn 2013. E-gas 
can be purchased at CNG filling stations throughout Germany, 
using a special Audi e-gas fuel card. Werlte is currently expected 
to be able to produce enough e-gas to power up to 1,500 Audi A3 
Sportback g-tron• models for 15,000 km of carbon-neutral 
 driving per year (see page 109).
The Audi e-gas project has implications that go far beyond the 
 automotive industry. E-gas has potential not only as a carbon- 
neutral, renewable fuel, but also as a means of storing large 
amounts of  renewable wind or solar power efficiently and inde-
pendently of where the power is actually generated – by convert-
ing it into methane gas and storing it in the natural gas grid. 
 Power-to-gas technology has now also been embraced by a num-
ber of major German energy providers, who are following Audi’s 
lead with initial  projects of their own.
Our Commitment to Emissions Targets
In the context of our commitment to the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) we are supporting the 
“WBCSD Road to Paris”, which is aimed at ensuring successful 
 discussions on the realization of the “2 degrees” target at the United 
Nations COP 21 climate conference in Paris at the end of 2015.
Back in March 2013, the  Volks wa gen Group set a benchmark when 
it became the first and only automaker to commit to the ambitious 
goal of reducing its European new-car fleet-average emissions to 
95 g CO2/km by 2020.
Emissions of 95 g CO2/km correspond to average fuel consumption 
across all vehicle classes and segments of less than 4 l/100 km 
(gasoline: 4.1 l, diesel: 3.6 l). Greenpeace Germany hailed 
 Volks wa gen’s decision as an “important symbol of commitment to 
environmental protection and society, and to the mass production 
of climate-friendly technical solutions.” Today, 57 models from the 
Group’s portfolio already emit meet the target of 95 g CO2/km.
For 2015, the  Volks wa gen Group’s individual target for its average 
new-car emissions under EU law is 132 g CO2/km. In fact, we were 
able to comply with this target ahead of schedule. This was confirmed 
in figures published by the European Commission in the Official 
Journal of the European Union, L315, in November 2014, which 
showed that the average new-car CO2 emissions of the  Volks wa gen 
Group in 2013 already stood at 129 g CO2/km (at the time of going to 
press, the latest data indicates that the figure for 2014 was 126 g).

For light commercial vehicles (vans), the EU has set CO2 emissions 
targets of 175 g/km for 2017 and 147 g/km for 2020. Here too we 
are making excellent headway: in 2014, the average new-vehicle 
CO2 emissions of the  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles brand’s 
models stood at 171 g/km. 
In the meantime, other major markets too have adopted caps 
on new-car CO2 emissions. In China,  Volks wa gen Passenger 
Cars models comply with the corporate average fuel consump-
tion limits in force in that market since 2012. And measures are 
in the  pipeline for further ambitious improvements, including 
improvements to the efficiency of our internal combustion en-
gines and the introduction of alternative drive technologies. For 
2015, China has set a new-car fleet-average fuel consumption 
target of 6.9 l/100 km. In the USA and Canada, a cap of 103 g 
CO2/km will apply from 2025.
 V  By using resources efficiently, we can 
reduce not only environmental impacts 
but also manufacturing costs.
 V NEDC TEST CYCLE COMES IN FOR CRITICISM
The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the procedure used by 
the EU to measure passenger car fuel consumption, has repeatedly 
come in for criticism from environmental organizations. The critics 
claim that the CO2 emissions measured under the NEDC’s 20-min-
ute laboratory-based test cycle are much lower than the figures 
generated under realistic modern driving conditions. Like all other

vehicle manufacturers, however, we must comply with this legally 
mandated test cycle. NEDC figures are the only figures we are 
 allowed to quote. Now, the European Union is considering the 
 introduction of a new test cycle, the “World Light Vehicle Test Pro-
cedure” (WLTP), which is designed to more closely represent mod-
ern driving conditions. Like the NEDC, the WLTP aims to provide an 
objective measurement standard for comparing technical prod-
ucts. The run-up to the WLTP’s scheduled introduction should be 
used to define a transparent and sustainably robust conversion 
procedure, because the existing EU target of 95 g CO2/km for 2020 
was also defined on the basis of the values generated in the NEDC 
test cycle. 
Resource Efficiency
Resource efficiency is a topic of exceptional strategic importance 
for  Volks wa gen. Across their life cycle, we must ensure that our 
products’ consumption of natural resources is kept to a mini-
mum. By using resources efficiently, we can reduce not only envi-
ronmental impacts but also manufacturing costs. In line with the 
recommendations of the EU’s European Resource Efficiency Plat-
form, we focus particularly on our consumption of raw materials, 
energy, water, air and land. 
Improving resource efficiency at  Volks wa gen is a matter for the 
entire Group. All business areas make their own specific contri-
bution to this challenge, and use their own specific indicators to 
measure and manage their performance. Systematic planning 
and implementation is coordinated by the Corporate Resource 
Efficiency Steering Group, which comprises members from a

variety of business areas and brands. Currently the Steering 
Group is developing a methodology for measuring resource effi-
ciency based on a defined set of indicators. For the general pub-
lic, the term “resource efficiency” tends to be interpreted very 
broadly, covering many different environmental aspects, and 
meaning different things to different people. The challenge 
therefore is to develop a set of indicators that on the one hand 
are meaningful to the public, while at the same time providing a 
fit-for-purpose controlling tool for in-house decision-makers. 
In parallel, a pool of best practices on resource efficiency is be-
ing developed, which will be made available to other business 
areas and brands. 
 46
 V  Environmental considerations from 
the very earliest stages of the product 
development process.
PRODUCT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
Our product planning and development processes are geared to 
developing vehicles that offer best possible fuel economy and 
 resource efficiency. Our corporate goals demand that all new vehi-
cles and technologies improve on the environmental performance 
of their predecessors, across the entire life cycle. Every new vehicle 
generation must be between 10 and 15% more efficient than its 
predecessor. To achieve this, we take environmental considera-
tions into account from the very earliest stages of the product devel-
opment process. The Group Environmental Principles Product 
have defined the key goals of the continuous improvement process 
as climate, resources and health.
For products of the  Volks wa gen brand, the development process is 
guided by the “Think Blue. Engineering.” Environmental Goals of 
the Technical Development department. These goals were revised 
in October 2014, and now include a commitment to “best-in-class 
fuel consumption in the driving cycle and over the vehicle’s service 
life”. To protect the health of vehicle occupants and road users, the 
brand has also once again adopted more rigorous requirements 
on interior emissions and noise levels. The Technical Development 
departments of the other Group brands have adopted similar envi-
ronmental objectives.

 V  “THINK BLUE. ENGINEERING.” AWARDS
In 2014, the  Volks wa gen brand presented its internal “Think Blue. 
Engineering.” awards for the second year in a row. Organized by 
 Volks wa gen Research and Development, the awards – in the cate-
gories “Product” and “Research and Development” – were pre-
sented to five environmentally outstanding projects in the fields 
of  climate, resources and health. An award was also presented for 
personal dedication. Like the Internal Environmental Award, 
which they replace, the purpose of the “Think Blue. Engineering.” 
awards – and the “Think Blue. Factory.” awards on the production 
side – is to reward employees for outstanding environmental 
commitment.
Life Cycle Engineering
 “Life Cycle Engineering” aims to improve the environmental 
footprint of a vehicle from cradle to grave. This process begins 
with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), in which the environmental 
impacts of the vehicle under development are assessed across the 
full life cycle – from resource extraction, through production and 
operation to eventual recycling. The LCA analysis makes it possi-
ble to identify those areas where improvements will have the big-
gest effect. These are the areas we then prioritize in our innova-
tion activities. In 2013 the Corporate Steering Group “Life Cycle 
Engineering” was set up, comprising experts from the brands. 
Their goal is to harmonize the guidelines and methodology for 
Life Cycle Assessments across the entire Group and to support 
best practice-sharing between successful Life Cycle Engineering 
projects.
Life Cycle Assessments and Environmental 
 Commendations
In its Environmental Commendations, the  Volks wa gen brand 
sums up the improvements in life cycle environmental perfor-
mance between new and previous models.  Volks wa gen Passenger 
Cars and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles have been publishing 
Environmental Commendations for new models and technologies 
ever since 2007. These detailed analyses are certified by inde-
pendent auditor TÜV NORD to confirm that they are based on 
 reliable data and were drawn up in accordance with the require-
ments of the LCA standards ISO 14040 and 14044. An Environ-
mental Commendation has also been published for the e-Golf•, 
which went on sale in 2014. It testifies to the excellent environ-
mental footprint of the e-Golf•, even when powered by convention-
al electricity. When charged with green electricity, the e-Golf’s 
life cycle CO2 emissions are reduced by a further 50%.
Audi has been producing Life Cycle Assessments for new model 
series since 2010. LCAs have been performed – and validated by 
TÜV NORD – for the Audi A3•, the Audi A6•, the Audi TT• and the 
Audi e-gas project (see page 92). Most recently, a Life Cycle 
 Assessment was published in August 2014 for the new Audi TT 
95
Coupé•. It shows that the model-year-2015 Audi TT Coupé• gener-
ates total life cycle CO2 emissions of 44.5 t – an 11% improvement 
over its predecessor. This good environmental footprint is partly 
down to lightweight engineering based on intelligent multi- 
material design, which shaves 50 kg off the unladen weight of 
the previous model. This means reduced fuel consumption 
 during the use phase, which not only reduces driving emissions 
but also means that less fuel needs to be produced in the first 
place, which again cuts CO2 emissions. 
 48
New Models from the Brands
The  Volks wa gen Group’s commitment to offering a broad array of 
technologies differentiates the company from many of its com-
petitors. Alongside further improved gasoline (TSI) and diesel 
(TDI) engines, the Group’s technology portfolio and development 
activities also span natural-gas vehicles, all-electric vehicles and 
 hybrid vehicles featuring battery and fuel-cell drive. This broad-
based approach dovetails with the Group’s goal of developing 
 attractive and affordable vehicles to cater to the widest possible 
spectrum of requirements. Our vehicles must use scarce re-
sources as efficiently as possible, while at the same time offering 
highest standards of comfort and convenience. 
 Volks wa gen’s aim is to explore and exploit the potential of all types 
of powertrain. Our Modular Transverse Matrix (MQB), which we

introduced in 2012, marks a revolution in automaking in two 
ways: firstly in terms of efficiency and secondly in terms of our abil-
ity to integrate technologies of the future. What our engineers have 
done, basically, is to create a system that allows any volume-pro-
duction model to be equipped with any type of powertrain, with 
no additional engineering effort. In this way the MQB will allow 
us to electrify more than 40 different models over the coming 
years. 
Efficiency Models (TSI and TDI) 2014
 Volks wa gen: In the Polo TSI BlueMotion• – the first ever Polo Blue-
Motion model to be fitted with a TSI engine – in 2014 engine man-
agement improvements reduced fuel consumption by a further 0.2 
liters to 4.1 l/100 km, with CO2 emissions of just 94 g/km. As a re-
sult, the TSI BlueMotion• is also the first ever gasoline-engined 
Polo to receive a class A label for energy efficiency and to achieve 
best-in-class ratings for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. 
Like all Polo models, it also complies with the strict Euro 6 emis-
sions standards.
Meanwhile the new Polo TDI BlueMotion•, like its predecessors, is 
setting a benchmark in the five-seater diesel market. Its newly 
 developed three-cylinder TDI engine returns fuel consumption of 
just 3.1 l/100 km (corresponding to CO2 emissions of 82 g/km). 
This is an improvement of 0.2 l/100 km over the already highly

 efficient predecessor model, and gives the Polo TDI BlueMotion• a 
maximum range of 1,400 km – enough to drive all the way from 
Flensburg in Germany to Venice in Italy on one tank of fuel. This 
benchmark fuel economy was achieved with the aid of underbody 
modifications, a polished radiator grille insert and aerodynami-
cally perfected front and rear spoilers. These drag-reduction 
measures are complemented by low-rolling-resistance tires. 
Audi: In June 2014, the German Bundestag added 66 extra- fuel-
efficient 140-kW Audi A6 2.0 TDI ultra• limousines to its fleet. 
With CO2 emissions of just 114 g/km, this model is one of the most 
 fuel-efficient premium automobiles in its segment.
SEAT: Active cylinder management in the new Leon• and Ibiza• 
models combines fuel economy with performance. In the low to 
medium rpm range, two of the engine’s four cylinders are shut 
down to save fuel. At higher rpm they are reactivated, to harness 
full power.
Natural Gas Models in 2014
 Volks wa gen: The newly released Golf Estate TGI BlueMotion• is 
powered by a natural gas engine that combines fuel efficiency with 
dynamic performance. On models with a dual-clutch gearbox, this 
four-cylinder bi-fuel natural gas/gasoline unit returns fuel con-
sumption of just 3.5 kg CNG/100 km in natural gas mode, with CO2 
emissions of just 95 g/km. The CNG-only range is approximately 
430 km, while the standard-fitted gasoline tank extends the total 
range to almost 1,400 km.
Audi: The A3 Sportback g-tron•, the first volume-production CNG 
model from Audi, sets a benchmark in carbon-neutral long-range 
mobility. When powered by Audi e-gas (see page 109), which cus-
tomers can purchase using the optional Audi e-gas fuel card, the 
A3 Sportback g-tron’s• tailpipe CO2 emissions are fully offset by 
the amount of CO2 absorbed when manufacturing this fuel in the 
first place. On fuel efficiency too this model breaks new ground, 
with test cycle CNG consumption of between 3.2 and 3.3 kg/ 
100 km (depending on transmission), which corresponds to CO2 
emissions of between 88 and 92 g/km – the sort of figures which in 
the past were confined to sub-compact models.
SEAT: Since September 2014, SEAT has been offering a natural 
gas version of its Leon ST• model (the 1.4 TGI). With fuel consump-
tion in CNG mode of 3.5 kg/100 km and CO2 emissions of 96 g/km, 
this is one of the most eco-friendly and fuel-efficient combus-
tion-engined vehicles on the market. The SEAT portfolio also 
 includes the Mii Ecofuel• and the CNG-powered Leon TGI•.

engine, the Golf GTE• returns average NEDC fuel consumption 
of just 1.5 l of gasoline and 11.4 kWh of electricity per 100 km, 
which corresponds to CO2 emissions of just 35 g/km. The GTE 
has a maximum all-electric driving range of 50 km and a total 
range of 940 km. Elsewhere in the portfolio, May 2014 saw the 
first deliveries of the  Volks wa gen XL1. This limited-production 
model built in  Osnabrück (Germany) is a technological game- 
changer. With test cycle fuel consumption of 0.9 l/100 km, the 
XL1• is the first “one- liter” car (capable of 100 km on one liter of 
fuel) in the world. Its plug-in hybrid system gives this two-seater 
an electric-only range (with zero local emissions) of up to 50 
km. In 2014, the XL1•  received the “Design of the Year” award – 
in the category “Transport Design” – from the Design Museum 
in London. 
The Paris Motor Show in September 2014 saw the world premiere 
of the Passat GTE•, the first plug-in hybrid  Volks wa gen available in 
both sedan and estate versions. The Passat GTE• has a zero-emis-
sion all-electric range of 50 km, and a total range on one tank of 
fuel and a fully charged battery of more than 1,000 km. NEDC fuel 
consumption is less than 2.0 l/100 km (less than 45 g CO2/km), 
while top speed is 220 km/h in hybrid mode, and 130 km/h in 
all-electric “e-mode”. The Passat GTE• will arrive on the market in 
the second half of 2015.
Audi: The second half of 2014 saw the European launch of the 
A3 Sportback e-tron•, Audi’s first plug-in hybrid model. Fuel con-
sumption as per the NEDC test cycle for plug-in hybrid vehicles is 
1.5 l/100 km, with CO2 emissions of 35 g/km. This model has a 
maximum all-electric range of 50 km, and a combined range of 
more than 900 km.
Porsche: In 2014, Porsche presented the Cayenne S E-Hybrid•, the 
first plug-in hybrid premium SUV. The combined output of the two 
drive systems is 416 hp (306 kW) while combined-cycle fuel con-
sumption is 3.4 l/100 km, with CO2 emissions of just 79 g/km. 
The Cayenne S E-Hybrid• has a maximum all-electric range of be-
tween 18 and 36 km, depending on driving style and topography.
 V ELECTRIC MOBILITY INITIATIVE IN CHINA
With total investment of more than €18 billion in new vehicles and 
technologies, new factory capacity and new, eco-friendly models, 
the  Volks wa gen Group has launched the biggest electric mobility 
initiative in Chinese automotive history. In 2015, the Group’s exist-
ing fleet of highly efficient and innovative models, which already 
includes the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid•, will be joined by the 
Audi A3 e-tron and the Golf GTE. From 2016, two models devel-
oped specifically for the Chinese market will follow: the Audi A6 
and a new mid-size sedan from the  Volks wa gen brand. Both these 
plug-in hybrid models are being co-developed with joint venture 
partners FAW  Volks wa gen and Shanghai  Volks wa gen, and will be 
built in China. The modular platform, which is being implemented 
at the Chinese factories too, will in future allow the Group to elec-
trify every model in the range, right across the spectrum from com-
pact cars to large limousines, and from all-electric to plug-in hybrid 
models.
Electric Vehicles in 2014
 Volks wa gen: In 2014, the  Volks wa gen e-Golf• went on sale in 
 Europe, Asia and North America. The e-Golf• delivers average 
 energy consumption of 12.7 kWh/100 km, and a driving range of 
up to 190 km on a single battery charge. When powered by green 
electricity (for example “BluePower”, see page 109), the e-Golf is 
carbon-neutral.
A TÜV NORD-certified Environmental Commendation has 
 already been issued for the e-Golf•. Three intuitively selectable 
driving modes (“Normal”, “Eco” and “Eco+”) and four equally

easily  engageable recuperation levels help drivers achieve maxi-
mum driving range per charge. Other functions include the 
“ Volks wa gen Car-Net-e-Remote” app, which allows a smart-
phone to be used to remotely launch battery charging, activate 
cabin pre-heating or cooling whenever the vehicle is on charge, 
or access vehicle data.
In spring 2014, the e-Golf took part in the world’s leading electric 
vehicle rally “World Advanced Vehicle Expedition” (WAVE), 
which this time took the drivers from Stuttgart to Lucerne. Over 
the rally stages, some of which were over 200 km in length, the 
e-Golf took first place in the main “Popular Wave” category. In 
the Silvretta electric car rally in July 2014, the e-Golf demonstrat-
ed its everyday versatility in particularly challenging terrain. 
Here too, it was crowned overall event winner. Finally, in October 
2014, the e-Golf won the “eCarTec Award 2014”, the Bavarian 
State Award for  Electric and Hybrid Mobility.  
 V  The modular transverse matrix enables 
us to integrate all the relevant drive 
systems – from conventional to fuel cell.
With the e-Golf  Volks wa gen has completed the circle, becoming 
the first carmaker in the world to offer all currently relevant drive 
systems within one model series. For an automaker, this repre-
sents a very high level of manufacturing flexibility, and it was 
the modular transverse matrix that made it possible. Moreover, in 
the wake of models like the all-electric e-Golf and the plug-in 
 hybrid Golf GTE•, our strategy will also allow us at a future date, 
and  subject to market demand, to integrate a further technology – 
fuel cells – into an attractively priced  production vehicle with great 
everyday driveability.
Fuel-Cell Models
As a further important step in our agenda for zero-carbon mobil-
ity, the  Volks wa gen brand is also developing the Golf Estate 
 HyMotion concept vehicle. The press and public got their first 
chance to see – and drive – this vehicle in November 2014, at the 
Los Angeles Auto Show. The Golf Estate HyMotion is fueled by 
 hydrogen (H2) and oxygen. A reaction takes place in the fuel cell 
between the hydrogen and oxygen, which combine to produce 
water. A byproduct of this reaction is electricity, which is used to 
power a zero-emission electric motor. The hydrogen is stored 
safely under the vehicle in four carbon-fiber tanks. The Golf 
 Estate HyMotion has a maximum range of 500 km. Refueling 
takes just three minutes.
With this concept model, the  Volks wa gen brand is demonstrating 
for the first time that hydrogen fuel cells are yet another drive tech-
nology that could be implemented using the MQB platform, as 
soon as research and development work is completed and a solu-
tion can be offered at a price acceptable to new-car buyers. Before 
any future market rollout however, a comprehensive hydrogen 
production and refueling infrastructure first needs to be put in 
place. At the same time, hydrogen propulsion only makes environ-
mental sense if the primary energy used to produce this fuel is 
 renewable.
Commercial Vehicles in 2014
 Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles: In October 2014, Leibniz 
University Hanover launched a twelve-month field trial with six 
electrically powered  Volks wa gen Caddy small urban delivery 
vans.  Volks wa gen expects that data from this trial, on aspects 
such as daily mileage, energy consumption and battery life and 
capacity, will provide valuable input for its ongoing development 
work on electric commercial vehicles. The e-Caddy has a maxi-
mum range of 136 km – more than sufficient to cover the average 
daily runs of an urban delivery van. At the end of 2014, a total of 
40 e-Caddies from  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicles were in-
volved in field trials.
MAN: MAN is the European market leader in natural gas-pow-
ered buses. In 2014, the MAN Lion’s City GL CNG articulated bus 
was named “Bus of the Year 2015” in the Bus Euro Test. With its 
CNG-powered Euro 6 engine, this model offers an extremely 
low-pollutant, climate-friendly answer to the challenges of urban 
transport. When operated on biogas, its carbon footprint is virtu-
ally zero.
Meanwhile, as part of MAN’s drive technology program, hybrid 
drives are set to be rolled out in the near future across all commer-
cial vehicle applications. However, different bus and truck appli-
cations – urban operation, long-distance operation or special- 
purpose vehicles – present very different requirements, which 
demand different hybrid concepts to match. At the 2014 IAA Com-
mercial Vehicles show in September, MAN presented a concept 
vehicle with parallel diesel/electric hybrid drive system for long-
haul applications. The diesel engine provides the main source of 
drive power, but the hybrid drive system also allows braking

 energy to be recuperated, stored and reused. Since long-haul 
transport accounts for the lion’s share of road transportation 
mileage, this is where use of hybrid technology stands to bring the 
biggest benefits in terms of CO2 emissions.  
Scania: The Scania G 410• Euro 6 was presented with a “Green 
Truck 2014” award by trade magazines VerkehrsRundschau and 
TRUCKER, which named it the greenest truck in its class. With 
 average fuel consumption of 23.3 l/100 km and CO2 emissions of 
734 g/km, Scania’s semitrailer tractor came first by a wide margin 
in these magazines’ environmental rankings.
 V  CO 2 LIMITS FOR TRUCKS AND BUSES
Having already implemented legislation to reduce the CO2 emis-
sions of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, in May 2014 
the European Commission presented its strategy for reducing the 
CO2 emissions of trucks and buses. The aim is to evaluate the 
 carbon emissions of the entire EU heavy-duty vehicle fleet as real-
istically as possible, for defined vehicle categories and driving 
 cycles. Before the EU takes any final decision however, an impact 
assessment first needs to be carried out to identify the most 
cost-effective solution. In view of the huge diversity of commercial 
vehicle versions, and the typical multi-stage production processes, 
the one-size-fits-all approach to emissions limits that has been 
used for cars and vans is not appropriate. Along with our competi-
tors, we advocate a certification approach that takes into account 
the complete vehicle – including different trailers and bodies. This 
would make tackling CO2 emissions the joint responsibility of 
 manufacturers, haulage companies and the state. The state would 
be responsible for infrastructure development and the haulage 
companies for intelligent management of the logistics processes. 
Our own responsibilities, as manufacturers, would include invest-
ing in the development of improved emissions control systems and 
new engines.
PRODUCTION AND LOGISTICS
By 2018, the  Volks wa gen Group is aiming to have cut its specific 
energy and water consumption, CO2 emissions, solvent emissions 
(VOC) and volume of waste per vehicle manufactured by 25%, 
compared with the 2010 baseline. This goal applies across all the 
Group’s production locations, and builds on the general produc-
tion process requirements defined in the Group Environmental 
Principles.
In terms of environmental impact reduction per unit of produc-
tion, by the end of 2014 we were already more than half-way to our 
goal for 2018, having cut production-related environmental im-
pacts by 19.3% (2013: 12.5%) compared with 2010 levels. This 
breaks down as follows (2013 figures in brackets):
 >  Specific energy consumption:   
– 18.5% (– 12.5%)
 >  Specific CO2 emissions:  
– 23.2% (– 19.5%)
 > Specific water consumption:   
– 6.9% (– 4.6%)
 >  Specific VOC emissions:  
– 26.1% (– 12.3%)
 >  Specific waste for disposal:  
– 21.7% (– 13.8%)
Green Production
To meet the Group targets for 2018, each brand has developed its 
own sustainable manufacturing program (see page 89). 
 Volks wa gen’s program, which is known as “Think Blue. Factory.”, 
was launched in 2012. 
 49
Worldwide, 27 production locations belonging to the  Volks wa gen 
brand are taking part in “Think Blue. Factory.”. Between the pro-
gram’s launch and the end of 2014, more than 2,700 out of a total of 
more than 5,000 planned projects had already been successfully 
implemented. Bearing in mind that “Think Blue. Factory.” can 
only succeed with the support and engagement of the employees, 
since 2013 specially trained environmental specialists have been 
acting as “ambassadors” at all participating locations. Worldwide, 
more than 1,000 ambassadors are now operating as front-line 
contacts and multipliers for the employees at these locations. The 
program has the full support of the Group Works Council, which 
has already organized its own training on the topic for approxi-
mately 250 council members. The program has so far won 30 
awards. In 2014 these accolades included a National Energy Globe 
award from the Energy Globe Foundation (Austria) and the World 
Environment Center’s Gold Medal for International Corporate 
Achievement in Sustainable Development (USA).
 V CARBON TRUST STANDARDS
Bentley is the first British carmaker to achieve certification to all 
three “Carbon Trust” standards. This triple accolade reflected the 
significant reductions achieved by Bentley in CO2 emissions, water 
use and waste output at its headquarters in Crewe (United King-
dom).  
The Scania G 410• Euro 6 semitrailer tractor is the greenest truck in its class.
101
Use of Resources in Production
The body accounts for approximately 40% of total vehicle mass, 
which is why lightweight body design is an important research and 
development focus at  Volks wa gen. Lightweighting techniques in-
clude functional integration – which involves integrating several 
different functions into one component – and use of low-density 
materials. At the same time however, cost factors and a wide range 
of environmental considerations must also be taken into account. 
Consequently, the  Volks wa gen Group brands always take an inte-
grated approach to lightweight engineering, looking at the whole 
life cycle of the product, from manufacturing through to recycling. 
One example here is the question of whether to build bodies from 
aluminum or steel. Aluminum reduces the weight of the vehicle, 
which can significantly reduce CO2 emissions during the use 
phase. However, production of aluminum is considerably more 
 energy-intensive than production of steel, leading to higher CO2 
emissions at the manufacturing stage. This initial environmental 
disadvantage is offset only after many miles of driving. Aluminum 
also has the disadvantage of being considerably more expensive 
than steel, resulting in a significant increase in vehicle purchase 
price. This is why small and mid-range car bodies still tend to be 
made predominantly of steel.
That said, it is perfectly possible to build a lightweight vehicle 
 using steel. Use of high-tensile and ultra-high-tensile steels 
 allows component gauges to be reduced, bringing a reduction in 
total body weight – with no reduction in crash performance. 
 Another principle of efficient steel-based lightweight design is 
the use of varying grades of steel – that is to say the right grades 
of steel are used at the right points in the body to meet local stiff-
ness requirements.
 V  PLASTIC ALTERNATIVES 
In 2014 Audi demonstrated that vehicle springs, too, offer signifi-
cant scope for weight savings. Audi and an Italian supplier have de-
veloped glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) springs that are 40% 
lighter than comparable steel springs for vehicles in the upper mid-
range segment, weighing just 1.6 kg. A set of four GFRP springs 
brings a total weight saving of 4.4 kg. And since this saving is partly 
made up of a reduction in unsprung weight, it also results in im-
proved suspension response and ride comfort. The GFRP springs are 
also corrosion-proof and the manufacturing process consumes a lot 
less energy than production of steel springs.
As well as improving the environmental footprint of vehicles in 
which they are used, recycled and renewable materials can also 
make good economic sense. New models of the  Volks wa gen brand 
already have a high recycled and renewable content. Calculations 
carried out for five models (Polo 5, Sharan NF, Golf 6, Golf 7, Passat 
8) show that such content makes up approximately one-third of 
their weight. 
 50
Wherever possible, the Group’s brands use renewable raw materi-
als. For example natural fibers like flax, cotton, wood, cellulose 
and hemp are used in floor insulation, boot linings, door and side 
panel trim and hood insulation. The Golf Sportsvan•, for example, 
features an armrest containing kenaf and flax fibers, while paper 
fibers are used in the cargo floor and roof reinforcement struc-
ture, and cotton fibers in the floor insulation.

Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions
In the reporting period, specific energy consumption per vehicle 
produced showed a continuous fall. As production volumes in-
creased, however, total energy consumption rose, although less 
rapidly than in the previous year (see page 126). We now meet 
 approximately one-third of our global electricity requirements 
from renewables. Between 2012 and 2020, the  Volks wa gen Group 
will invest some €600 million in continued expansion of renewa-
ble energies such as wind, hydroelectric power, solar power and 
biomass. Investments in 2014 reached approximately €23 million. 
On top of this, we have so far invested some €15 million in fuel con-
version measures at our CHP plant in Braunschweig and some €65 
million in the combined gas and steam plant in Kassel. By 2014, 
more than 25 solar photovoltaic systems were up and running at 
our locations, with a total generating capacity of approximately 60 
MW. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of approxi-
mately 20,000 private households. A number of brands have also 
set their own ambitious targets. Lamborghini for example is look-
ing to make its production processes carbon-neutral by 2015. The 
17,000 square-meter photovoltaic system on the roof of the central 
production shop at the Sant’Agata location is an important mile-
stone en route to this goal.
 V  We now meet approximately one-third 
of our global electricity requirements 
from renewables.
Large photovoltaic systems have also been installed at the Emden 
(Germany), Crewe (United Kingdom), Martorell (Spain) and Chat-
tanooga (USA) locations – and further installations are in the pipe-
line across the Group. In early 2014, a second photovoltaic system 
went into operation at the  Volks wa gen Braunschweig location. 
Covering an area of 3,000 square meters, it has an annual capacity 
of 363 MWh, and is capable of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 
281 t. In 2014, a photovoltaic system also went into operation at 
the  Volks wa gen Zwickau location. It has an area of 900 square 
 meters, can generate 90 MWh of electricity annually for use on the 
final vehicle assembly lines, and can reduce annual CO2 emissions 
by up to 80 t.
In November 2014, drilling began for a geothermal heat plant 
close to the Audi factory in Gyo˝r (Hungary). When this plant goes 
into operation – probably in late 2015 – it will supply at least 
82,000 MWh of geothermal energy annually, meeting approxi-
mately 60% of the plant’s total heat requirements, and reducing 
Audi’s CO2 emissions by a further 23,000 t.
With the expansion of its Leipzig location, Porsche has incorpo-
rated features that will reduce CO2 emissions by 11,637 t. annu-
ally compared with a conventional design. The biggest savings 
will come from the use of waste heat from the nearby wood-
chip-fired heating plant, which will provide almost 80% car-
bon-neutral heating at the location and result in cost savings of 
approximately €360,000 per annum. A further important con-
tributor is a rooftop photovoltaic plant installed on the body shop. 
In 2014, when operating well below full capacity, this system 
 delivered CO2 savings of 115 t. In the future, under optimal solar 
conditions, it will offer Porsche potential annual savings of at 
least 1,000 t of CO2. MAN, meanwhile, reduced CO2 emissions 
at its production locations by approximately 105,400 t in 2014, 
bringing the total improvement over 2008 levels to 19% – a five 
percentage point improvement over 2013. A wide range of meas-
ures were responsible for this result, including more efficient 
production technologies, optimized heating and ventilation sys-
tems and use of renewable energy, for example with the installa-
tion of a photovoltaic system at the Pinetown location in South 
Africa.
 Volks wa gen Chattanooga Solar Park is the largest solar power plant 
 operated by an automaker in the USA.
Late in 2013, SEAT brought the auto industry’s largest roof-mounted 
 photovoltaic plant “SEAT al Sol” on stream in Martorell (Spain). 
103
In 2014, more than 1,500 process-optimization measures in the 
energy and environment sectors were filed across the Group on the 
intranet-based  Volks wa gen Group IT tool “Massnahmen@web”. 
These led to CO2 savings of 195,000 t, annual energy savings of 
505 GWh, and cost savings of over €30 million.
 V  EMPLOYEES SUGGEST WAYS TO SAVE
We’re all familiar with the topic from our homes – a substantial pro-
portion of the energy we consume is accounted for by equipment 
that isn’t being used and is merely in standby mode. The solution 
here is to rigorously switch off what is not in use. At the factory, 
however, the complex interdependency of various items of equip-
ment means that switching off can be more complicated than it 
might seem at first glance. To indicate clearly which items of equip-
ment can be shut down when, employees at the Kassel and Emden 
locations came up with the idea of using energy efficiency labels 
like the ones on domestic appliances and invented their own system 
along these lines. Now, employees on the shop floor can see at a 
glance what they can save by switching off their machines. If there 
are operational reasons for not switching off, the label shows a 
bright red “NO” and describes which items must not be shut down 
under any circumstances. In just one department of the Kassel loca-
tion, systematically switching off all the equipment during produc-
tion-free periods cut CO2 emissions by 120 t. The potential offered 
by reducing the baseload was already brought to the attention of 
management and employees back in 2011 by annual competitions 
between the locations and production sectors at the  Volks wa gen 
and  Volks wa gen Commercial Vehicle brands. At the same time a 
process standard was drawn up along with a manual providing rec-
ommendations and measures, with the result that all production 
locations at these brands regularly conduct baseload monitoring 
exercises and report on their findings.
The participation of the Group brands in joint research projects 
with external partners is a further important source of inspira-
tion and new ideas for energy savings. One example is  Volks wa gen 
and Audi’s participation in the German research alliance “Inno-
vation Alliance Green Carbody Technologies” (InnoCaT). In a 
 recent InnoCaT research project, Siemens,  Volks wa gen and a 
Fraunhofer Institute studied the movement sequences of produc-
tion robots and developed a simulation model to work out the most 
energy-efficient trajectories. Smoother trajectories result in a sig-
nificant reduction in energy consumption, with tests showing 
that this approach can cut energy consumption by almost one-
half. The goal is to develop software that can be used to repro-
gram existing robots for more energy-efficient operation, with-
out making changes to the production process.  
Green IT
Reducing the electricity consumption of IT components has been a 
strategic objective of the  Volks wa gen Group for many years. Dur-
ing the last RFQ process for PCs, in early 2014, common Group-
wide specifications were drawn up for energy-efficient PC work-
station hardware. For example, it was decided to exclusively use 
energy-efficient TFT monitors with LED backlighting. Only ener-
gy-efficient desktop PCs and laptops are now eligible for the 
Group’s central IT purchasing basket. All Group companies 
across the globe can order this hardware via a special B2B portal. 
By the end of 2014, 150 companies in 35 countries were already 
using the central IT purchasing basket. Across the Group, savings 
in electricity consumption in 2014 from the introduction of new 
energy-efficient, eco-friendly equipment purchased from the 
 central IT basket amounted to approximately 47,000 mega-
watt-hours (MWh). The savings work out at a reduction in annual 
electricity consumption per individual PC workstation from 206 to 
around 60 kilowatt-hours (kWh). In 2014 SEAT, a participant in 
the EuroEnergest project, an energy efficiency project supported 
by the European Commission, demonstrated how intelligent IT 
 systems optimize energy consumption, maximize use of renewa-
ble energy and deliver 10% energy savings. 
 V EMISSIONS TRADING
The procedure for the allocation of CO2 emissions certificates under 
the European Union’s Emissions Trading System changed fundamen-
tally in 2013, at the start of the third trading period (2013 – 2020). For 
electricity companies, full auctioning has been introduced. For the 
manufacturing industry and certain types of power plant (e.g. CHP 
plants), some certificates are still allocated free of charge. However, 
the number of free certificates will fall steadily throughout the trad-
ing period. Any certificates required on top of the free allocation will 
have to be either purchased at auction or covered by credits for emis-
sions reduction projects under the Joint Implementation scheme and 
Clean Development Mechanism. 30  Volks wa gen Group locations are 
included in the European Emissions Trading System. For 2014, the 
Group received a free allocation of 1,090,262 emissions certificates 
(169,925 less than the previous year). As well as the European Union, 
various other countries in which  Volks wa gen Group production loca-
tions are based are planning to introduce emissions trading. China for 
example has already launched seven pilot emissions trading schemes, 
in which the  Volks wa gen Group is not involved at the present time. 
Going forward, the Chinese government plans to expand these pilot 
projects into a national emissions trading system.
 V  AWARDS FOR SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS
With the internally awarded “Blue Building” certification we aim to 
promote the construction of energy-efficient and sustainable build-
ings within the  Volks wa gen Group. These buildings must significantly 
surpass the requirements of energy efficiency legislation. Under the 
scheme, buildings that score highly on a number of supplementary cri-
teria – employee-friendly design, cost-efficient operation and environ-

mentally friendly planning and construction – win the additional 
designation “Plus”. At the present time, a variety of commercial and 
residential buildings currently under construction are being optimized 
in line with the “Blue Building” standards. The most outstanding 
 example is a new office complex that will surpass statutory energy ef-
ficiency requirements by more than 35%. 
In November 2014, the  Volks wa gen engine factory in Chemnitz re-
ceived an external award for sustainable building design – the Gold 
Certificate of the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB). The 
jury was particularly impressed by the way that expansion at the loca-
tion had been integrated in a balanced way with the surrounding envi-
ronment, and by the use of resource-efficient production equipment. 
Water Consumption
Despite the increase in the number of production locations within 
the Group, water consumption per vehicle manufactured was re-
duced in 2014 (see page 131). We are well aware that in many parts 
of the world water is a very valuable resource, and that managing 
this resource is an increasingly challenging task. That is why we 
adopted water as our focus topic for 2014. With our pioneering 
 water footprint analysis in 2013, calculated on the basis of exten-
sive LCA data, we identified those processes that consume most 
water over the life cycle of a representative selection of  Volks wa gen 
brand models. The water footprint calculation showed that as far 
as water is concerned, the use phase plays only a minor role. A 
large proportion of water consumption is attributable to the pro-
duction process. Of this, most is accounted for by upstream supply 
chain operations. Nevertheless, a review in 2014 underlined the 
importance for the  Volks wa gen Group of cutting water consump-
tion. This is because 58% of our entire freshwater consumption – 
approximately 24 million cubic meters – is attributable to loca-
tions situated in regions where groundwater resources are at risk 
– above all Mexico, Spain, South Africa, India and China. 
In our environmental management strategy we always take into 
account the fact that water resource availability varies greatly 
from region to region, and that solutions must be adapted accord-
ingly. The same philosophy also underlies the water management 
strategy adopted by the Corporate Environment and Energy Steer-
ing Group in 2014, where four action areas were defined:
 >  Safe and reliable water supply and sewerage. We aim to pro-
tect groundwater reserves against pollution, and to avoid pro-
duction downtimes caused by water shortages.
 > Efficient water use throughout the life cycle. By using water as 
economically and efficiently as possible during the production 
process, and by recycling as much water as possible, we aim to 
reduce total water consumption to the great possible extent.
 > Social and environmental initiatives. Particularly through 
our biodiversity projects, we help to protect water resources and 
to promote public environmental awareness.
 > Transparency. We communicate our goals and activities to the 
public. In 2013  Volks wa gen became the world’s first automaker 
 Volks wa gen location in Pamplona (Spain): Despite a sharp increase in production, it was able to cut its absolute water consumption by half between 2001 and 2014.
105
to commit to the United Nations CEO Water Mandate. Also, since 
2011, we have been providing extensive disclosure of our water 
management practices and progress, by completing the very 
 detailed CDP water management questionnaire.
These four priorities were reflected in the water conservation 
measures that we pursued during the reporting period. In 2012, 
the paintshop at  Volks wa gen’s Chengdu location (China) became 
the first paintshop in Asia to use “EcoDry Scrubber” technology, 
which reduces water consumption on the painting line by up to 
23% compared with solvent-based processes. And at the Foshan 
location, also in China, we are aiming to go one step further and 
achieve 100% wastewater recycling by 2015. A wide range of 
 treatment and recycling measures at the Bentley location in 
Crewe (United Kingdom) resulted in a 57% reduction in water 
use per vehicle manufactured between 2010 and 2014. The 
 Volks wa gen location in Pamplona (Spain) has been very success-
ful over the years. Despite a sharp increase in production, it was 
able to cut its absolute water consumption by half between 2001 
and 2014. At the Curitiba location in Brazil, one simple measure 
introduced in 2014 has had a big effect on water use: the water 
used during regular testing of the firefighting system is now 
drained off into a rainwater retention basin and recycled as cool-
ing water. In this way, annual freshwater consumption has been 
reduced by approximately 18,000 m3.
 V  We always take the fact into account  
that water resource availability varies 
greatly from region to region.
Solvent Emissions
During the reporting period, the increase in vehicle output and 
the related rise in the volume of painting work led to a slight in-
crease in absolute solvent emissions (VOC) (see page  129). Reduc-
ing VOC emissions from manufacturing is therefore a key focus for 
2015 in  Volks wa gen’s “Think Blue. Factory.” sustainable manu-
facturing program. To identify further scope for savings, a pilot 
workshop was held in Hanover in mid-October 2014 which 
brought together experts from the central environment functions, 
from “Think Blue. Factory.” and from the planning sectors. Also 
present were paintshop, environmental protection, factory plan-
ning, brand planning and process engineering specialists. Like 
for the environmental indicators “waste for disposal” and “water 
consumption”, a package of tools and suggested measures was 
drawn up, which was then passed on to all locations for implemen-
tation.
A further focus is on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emis-
sions. It should be noted that the number of employees capable of 
influencing this indicator, through their ideas and their personal 
behavior, is far greater than for VOC emissions.
Waste Output
Owing to the rise in production output in the reporting period, the 
volumes of hazardous and non-hazardous waste also increased. 
The proportions of waste for disposal in these volumes were re-
duced in 2014, while the recycling ratio increased (see page  130).
A waste strategy in force across the Group helps all locations to re-
duce and avoid waste. Optimal systems are in place for the recy-
cling of production waste, packaging materials and waste from 
workshops and the Technical Development department. For recy-
clable production waste that can be sold on the market, a system 
has been rolled out across the Group that helps to improve the effi-
ciency of the entire process. The focus is not only on revenue gener-
ation but also on optimized preparation of the waste for efficient 
transportation. 
 52
In 2014, Scania adopted waste as a focus topic. The target is im-
proved recycling ratios and reduced consumption of materials. 
There are also plans to cooperate more closely with waste disposal 
contractors. Bentley already achieved its “zero to landfill” target in 
2013, having cut waste per vehicle by 85% between 2000 and 
2013. Recycling facilities are available across the factory.
Waste reduction is an important focus at our Chinese locations 
too. In April 2014, we launched a waste project at the Anting and 
Foshan locations, together with our joint venture partners. In co-
operation with employees and our partners, we are developing 
systems that will improve recycling ratios through improved sort-
ing, storage and handling of waste at the factory itself, and 
through optimized recycling technologies at the waste disposal 
companies. The aim is to increase the recycling ratio to 80%.
Green Logistics
For our incoming deliveries of raw materials and supplies, for 
inter-location shipments and for shipments of vehicles leaving 
our locations, we utilize all modes of transport. The aim is to 
make logistics processes as environmentally compatible and 
efficient as possible and to shift an increasing share of total 
transportation volumes to rail and sea. Since 2012 a special 
Corporate Steering Group has been responsible for coordinat-
ing this “Green Logistics” approach. In 2014 this Steering 
Group defined work packages for specific measures, account-
ing practices, communication, qualification and internal tar-
get achievement methods. The German Nature and Biodiversity 
Conservation Union (NABU) played an active advisory role dur-
ing this period.
In 2014, the  Volks wa gen Wolfsburg location became the first to 
define binding environmental performance objectives for its Plant 
Logistics, requiring CO2 emissions from internal truck and rail 
freight movements to be reduced by one-quarter. A few statistics 
will help to illustrate the scale of logistics operations at this loca-
tion. Every day, 3,400 new vehicles leave the location on 210 dou-
ble-decker rail wagons and 140 road transporters, while inbound 
shipments of raw materials, parts and assemblies are received 
from around 2,600 suppliers, transported on around 100 rail 
wagons and some 910 trucks.

Since 2014, all finished engines transported from Chemnitz to 
Emden have now gone by rail, reducing CO2 emissions by 165 t an-
nually. As far as vehicle transportation is concerned, switching 
from road to rail reduced annual CO2 emissions from European 
mainline operations by a further 1,812 t in 2014. At the same time 
we are making increased use of low-CO2 rail wagons that also meet 
the strictest standards on noise emissions. For example 
 Volks wa gen Group Logistics has hired 300 sliding wall wagons 
from Touax Rail Ltd, built by the Polish manufacturer Greenbrier. 
These wagons, which are equipped with “whispering brakes” that 
reduce noise by more than 75%, are expected to be in use on rail 
routes between European locations of the  Volks wa gen Group by 
February 2015. This will result in a further shift in transport from 
road to rail and a further reduction in CO2 emissions.
 V  By making use of environmentally 
friendly and cost-efficient modes  
of transport, the logistics sector is  
making an important contribution  
to the  corporate objectives of the 
 Volks wa gen Group.
Every year, Porsche too sets green logistics targets. These targets 
are aimed at reducing packaging volumes, promoting the use of 
reusable containers and the purchasing of efficient plant and 
equipment, reducing transport operations and promoting the use 
of environmentally friendly modes of transport. On the inbound 
logistics side, haulage contractors must comply with green logis-
tics requirements on aspects such as use of low-pollutant vehicles, 
driver training and vehicle maintenance intervals. Since 2014, 
100% of haulage trucks operated by freight forwarders serving 
Porsche have complied with Euro 5 or higher emissions stand-
ards. All logistics processes at Porsche are also certified to DIN 
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Maritime shipping is a further impor-
tant cornerstone of Porsche’s logistics operations. By adding a 
third port to its logistics network in China, the company has re-
duced its CO2 emissions in this country by 45%. Porsche has also 
expanded its transport network in the United Kingdom, where a 
second port has reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 10%. 
As the  Volks wa gen Group’s operations become increasingly inter-
nationalized, the importance of sea and inland waterway transport 
continues to grow. By making use of such environmentally friendly 
and cost-efficient modes of transport, the logistics sector is making 
an important contribution to the corporate objectives of the 
 Volks wa gen Group. A further important landmark in 2014 was the 
opening of the Fallersleben container terminal operated by GVZ 
 Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, which has extended the capabili-
ties of the Wolfsburg Multimodal Logistics Center. In its first year of 
operation, this terminal handled approximately 152,751 m³ of 
goods for  Volks wa gen AG, which is one of GVZ Wolfsburg’s main cus-
tomers.
 V CLEAN SHIPPING INDEX  
In October 2013, the  Volks wa gen Group became the first German 
automaker to join the Clean Shipping Network. Since May 2014 
 Volks wa gen Group Logistics has held a seat on the board of this as-
sociation of vessel owners and users. The association’s Clean Ship-
ping Index (CSI) is used by  Volks wa gen Group Logistics as a tool for 
evaluating the environmental impacts of its ocean shipping. The in-
dex transparently informs the members of the Clean Shipping Net-
work about the emissions of individual ships and individual routes, 
and allows them to take environmental criteria into consideration 
when selecting vessels. As well as the handling of chemicals and 
waste disposal, such criteria also include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitro-
gen oxide (NOX) and sulfur oxide (SOX) emissions.  
Biodiversity
Conservation of biological diversity is one of the  Volks wa gen Group’s 
stated aims. In 2007  Volks wa gen formulated a mission statement in 
which it committed to preserving biodiversity “at all of its locations”. 
As a member of the “Biodiversity in Good Company” initiative, we 
are also committed to integrating biodiversity protection step by step 
into our management processes. By 2014, for example,  Volks wa gen 
had commissioned 32 reports that analyzed and evaluated emis-
sions risks to water, soil and biodiversity at its European production 
locations. We also give preference to brownfield sites when planning 
construction projects, in order to minimize land sealing. 
 Volks wa gen also promotes the development of practical biodiversi-
ty management tools, by participating in expert forums and scien-
tific studies. These include the joint working group on manage-
ment indicators of “Biodiversity in Good Company” and econsense, 
and a research project studying the impact of product systems on 
biodiversity led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, a 
project in which the German Federal Ministry for the Environ-
ment is participating. 
 53
In 2014 we again used the “Biodiversity in Good Company” initia-
tive as a learning and dialogue platform – for the first time also 
open to our suppliers – and as a tool for bringing together stake-
holders from politics, public bodies, associations and universities 
at both national and international level. NABU continued to serve 
as an adviser and project partner.
Our voluntary initiatives to protect biodiversity or safeguard eco-
system services focused on the following areas: research funding; 
biotope networking; protection of nature and biodiversity; and 
 afforestation and forest conversion. These initiatives were in many 
cases combined with environmental education measures. Light-
house projects during the reporting period comprised:
 >  The “Think Blue. Nature.” project, in which  Volks wa gen’s initial 
investment will be €260,000. As well as sponsoring for the 
 CESMO (= Corridor Ecologico Sierra Madre Oriental, 4 million 
hectares) biodiversity corridor, which provides a habitat for

SALES, USE AND RECYCLING
Our philosophy of forward-thinking, environmentally minded 
mobility spans every stage in the value chain, but the use phase is 
pivotal, not just in terms of its impacts; it is also critical to success, 
because customers’ needs are evolving. Fuel-efficient vehicles 
are just one, albeit vital, component of progressive mobility that 
produces less CO2. Which is why we are committed to offering our 
customers the fullest possible range of mobility services. And the 
Group’s Environmental Strategy also extends to the final stage of 
the vehicle’s life cycle: recycling.
Sales Initiatives 
The  Volks wa gen brand is gradually anchoring its “Think Blue.” 
strategy in other business areas to boost environmental sustaina-
bility: in early 2014, the brand began a campaign to get the 1,200 
 Volks wa gen dealerships in Germany more closely involved in its 
environmental management system. The aim is to cut CO2 emis-
sions from our dealer network by 25% by 2020 – which will also 
help to cut operating costs. By the end of 2015, we want more than 
60% of car dealerships to have benefited from our advisory ser-
vice. Our eco-efficiency service is available to all partner compa-
nies. In a “pre-check”, the  Volks wa gen consultants collate data on 
the dealers’ energy consumption, building shell and technology, 
and the use of regenerative energies. Each dealer can then take 
suitable action based on the results. Standout eco-friendly dealer-
ships are awarded the “Future Climate inspired by Think Blue.” 
certificate.  Volks wa gen is advised on this project by the German 
Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU). From 2015, 
we will be extending this initiative to our 11,500 dealers outside 
of Germany: the “Think Blue. Dealer.” initiative wants up to 60% 
of dealers worldwide to have received energy efficiency advice by 
2018. Approved dealers may use the “Certified Think Blue. Deal-
er” logo.
Porsche has also launched a sustainability initiative to support 
dealers, aimed at improving energy efficiency among existing

also received the Chattanooga Times Free Press “Best Green 
Business Award”.
The environmental project drawn up by  Volks wa gen Financial Services and 
NABU combines promoting climate-friendly vehicle fleet management with 
restoring a number of German wetland areas.

Supplementary Mobility Card
At present, electric vehicles are still limited by their range. In 
 response,  Volks wa gen has joined forces with Euromobil to devise 
the “Supplementary Mobility Card”. Euromobil is the car hire arm 
of the  Volks wa gen Group sales and service partners, and boasts 
the largest network in Germany, with over 2,400 rental locations. 
Customers can rent vehicles from the  Volks wa gen, Audi, SEAT and 
ŠKODA brands.
Within the first three years of purchasing one of our electric cars, 
the Supplementary Mobility Card allows customers to borrow a 
conventional-powertrain vehicle free of charge from any of the 
participating Euromobil outlets in Germany for up to a maximum 
of 30 days a year, including a set free kilometer allowance.
 Volks wa gen Mobility Card
As part of the German Government’s “Electromobility Showcase” 
program, the first pilot phase of the “ Volks wa gen Mobility Card” 
was launched in June 2014 in Hanover, with 50 participants. The 
card provides customers with an integrated range of services de-
signed to make electromobility more user-friendly and efficient. 
For example, it can be used to reserve selected charging stations 
and parking spaces before setting out on a journey. Accounts are 
settled via the  Volks wa gen app, which also offers route planning 
with up-to-date traffic and parking information, so that custom-
ers can select the best mode of transport to their destination. The 
trial phase will run until the end of 2015; depending on the re-
sults, the  Volks wa gen Mobility Card will then be rolled out to other 
regions.
 V  THE CHALLENGE OF DIGITIZATION
Growing digitization and new mobility concepts pose fresh chal-
lenges for vehicle sales. In November 2014, this prompted the 
 Volks wa gen brand to join with the Institut für Automobil-
wirtschaft (IFA) at Nürtingen-Geislingen University (HfWU) to 
 create the “Future Retail Lab”. The lab will develop new sales strat-
egies and concepts for the industry, and translate them into prac-
tice at  Volks wa gen.
Marketing Initiatives
Alongside the development of ever more fuel-efficient new models, 
the Group boasts a wide range of other offerings for eco-friendly 
mobility. These include:
 > Spotlighting particularly efficient vehicles and low-carbon tech-
nologies in our product communications by awarding them effi-
ciency badges (pages 95 – 98), and reporting on environmental 
progress in new models through Life Cycle Assessments and 
 Environmental Commendations (see pages 94 – 95).
 > Information and campaigns inspiring drivers to adopt fuel-effi-
cient, eco-friendly driving habits.
 > e-mobility service offerings such as green electricity tariffs and a 
rapid-charging infrastructure such as the “wallbox”.
The “electrified! – electric mobility weeks by  Volks wa gen”, held 
in March 2014 at the former Tempelhof airport in Berlin, were 
attended by some 10,000 visitors keen to find out more about elec-
tric  mobility at  Volks wa gen. Our alternative-powertrain vehicles 
were taken for a total of 6,000 test drives. From July to October, 
 Volks wa gen then took its electric models on tour to nine German 
cities on the “electrified! tour 2014”.
 V  The use phase is decisive for the success 
of future-oriented and environmentally 
minded mobility.
Driving electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids has become far more 
convenient in Germany since the introduction of the “Charge&Fuel 
Card” from  Volks wa gen Financial Services in January 2015. It 
 allows  Volks wa gen and Audi customers to fill up with electricity and 
conventional fuel on the same card. The Charge&Fuel Card pro-
vides access to more than 1,200 public charging stations around 
the country run by RWE, EnBW and Ladenetz. Previously, each 
charging operation had been billed locally and at different rates by 
individual suppliers. The card can also be used to fill up with regu-
lar fuel at around 10,000 filling stations. In the past, this would 
have meant customers having to carry up to 40 different cards, 
codes or other forms of authentication with them. The new service 
from  Volks wa gen consolidates all this onto a single card or app.
109
Eco-Friendly Driving
Regardless of model or brand, along with the development of ever 
more efficient vehicles, eco-friendly driving habits are the deci-
sive way to cut fuel consumption and emissions of CO2, noise and 
airborne pollutants. We support our customers in this respect with 
a range of courses:
 > In Germany,  Volks wa gen and NABU offer free fuel economy 
training in the project “Change over – just save fuel”. Courses 
are held in collaboration with local NABU groups,  Volks wa gen 
dealers and a team of professional trainers from  Volks wa gen 
Driving Experience. 
 > Customers can also book “Think Blue. Eco-Training” courses 
directly with  Volks wa gen in Germany, Hong Kong and Singa-
pore. 
 > In collaboration with Deutsche Verkehrswacht and caremotion, 
 Volks wa gen Financial Services offer “ECO driving courses” for 
drivers of fleet vehicles.
In 2014, the eco-driving courses conducted by  Volks wa gen Driv-
ing Experience attracted 978 participants. These courses current-
ly focus on Germany and the  Volks wa gen brand, but there are 
plans to roll them out across the Group over the next few years.
Green Electricity. Electric vehicles powered by green electricity 
produce zero emissions. The  Volks wa gen, Audi and Porsche 
brands have come up with suitable tariffs for their customers. 
e-up!• drivers can charge their vehicles with “BluePower” car-
bon-neutral electricity, generated by hydropower plants in Germa-
ny, Austria and Switzerland. BluePower is also available for the 
Porsche hybrid vehicles. And following the launch of the A3 e-tron• 
in 2014, customers can now also purchase “Audi energy”, likewise 
generated by hydroelectric power stations in Germany, Austria 
and Switzerland, as documented by the “ok power” logo. 
Green Gas. Audi A3 Sportback g-tron• drivers have been virtually 
carbon-neutral since March 2014, thanks to the “Audi e-gas fuel 
card”. Audi records the quantities of gas each customer purchases 
with the card, and ensures that exactly the same quantity of syn-
thetically produced, renewable Audi e-gas is fed into the German 
natural gas network to compensate. The green gas is produced at 
Audi’s own power-to-gas plant in Werlte, which uses waste CO2 as a 
raw material in production (see page 92). 
 V  SAVE FUEL WITH “THINK BLUE. TRAINER.”  
“Think Blue. Trainer.” is a driver assistance program offering vital in-
formation on current fuel consumption during the journey, to en-
courage more eco-friendly driving habits. Essentially, the display 
system operates on the principle “blue = good”, “gray = bad”, and 
uses the Blue Score assessment system: if the driver is driving eco-
nomically, the circle will fill with blue bars, and if they are not, the 
majority of bars will be grey. A Blue Score of 100 represents optimal 
driving performance. The Trainer also provides the driver with valu-
able live feedback on gear shifts, speed and foresight, as well as 
coasting and overrun fuel cut-off. The “Think Blue. Trainer.” already 
features in the conventional-powertrain e-up!• and up!• models, as 
well as in the Polo• and Passat•, and will be gradually rolled out to 
other models as well. The range of functions offered by the “Think 
Blue. Trainer.” can be further extended with the “ Volks wa gen Car-
Net Think Blue. Trainer.” app, which communicates with the vehicle 
and can be operated via the infotainment system. The app contains 
training challenges that provide additional motivation. All trips are 
automatically stored, and can later be used for cross-comparison.
Eco-Friendly Fleet Management  
Commercial fleets are a powerful lever for making road traffic 
more environmentally compatible. More than 60% of all newly 
registered cars are fleet vehicles, and most of them clock up very 
high mileage. What is more, they are often leased, and therefore 
replaced every few years.  Volks wa gen Financial Services and NABU 
have come up with an environmental program which allows the 
fleet manager to protect the environment and cut costs at the same 
time. Since the program was launched,  Volks wa gen Leasing GmbH 
has seen the number of particularly fuel-efficient vehicles in its 
portfolio increase. As a result, over the past six years the average 
CO2 emissions of newly registered fleet vehicles for key-account

 Volks wa gen Leasing and NABU since 2010, and recognizes eco-
logically responsible fleet managers. In 2014, for the first time 
ever, more than 100 key accounts competed for the award, set-
ting a new record and demonstrating that eco-friendly fleet 
management is no longer a peripheral issue but at the very heart 
of fleet business. Awards were presented to the companies with 
the highest proportion of eco-friendly  Volks wa gen Group vehi-
cles in three different fleet size categories.
Solutions for Urban Mobility of the Future
The challenges of urban mobility, and the possible solutions to 
this problem, have long been the subject of much debate. Ex-
panding urban populations, megacities, lack of parking spaces, 
traffic jams, overloading of public transport, digitization and 
networking are the buzzwords. Systematically analyzing these 
challenges, and deriving possible solutions, is an ongoing task 
for mobility research. 2013 saw publication of the “Urban Mobil-
ity 2030” film, the first ever comprehensive visualization of this 
topic. 
 55
In fiscal 2014, we held intensive discussions with the general pub-
lic, for example at the  Volks wa gen eMobility week in Berlin, early 
in the year, as well as at a string of conferences. The  Volks wa gen 
Group has also stepped up its intelligent mobility activities, in-
cluding the  Volks wa gen CarNet with online traffic information 
in  selected car models, the pilot project “Think Blue.  Share a 
 Volks wa gen.”, and a mobility card in the context of the “Lower 
Saxony Electromobility Showcase”, plus a number of innovative 
driver assistance systems for our production vehicles, and 
demonstrations of automated and piloted driving. Research pro-
jects such as the Intersection Pilot for interaction between the 
 vehicle and the traffic lights on the one hand, and location-specif-
ic mobility and traffic management concepts such as the Traffic 
Task Force in Wolfsburg  on the other, round out our wide range of 
ideas on how to make future mobility more intelligent.

Carsharing 
“Quicar” is the name of the  Volks wa gen carsharing project, oper-
ated by  Volks wa gen Financial Services: Over 200 Golf BlueMotion 
1.6 TDI• cars from the  Volks wa gen brand are available to rent at 
approximately 50 stations in and around Hanover. Some 12,000 
customers have already registered with the Quicar scheme, which 
offers widespread availability of these efficient vehicles, an inex-
pensive and flexible system of charges and a simple operating con-
cept. In 2013,  Volks wa gen Financial Services, together with its 
partner Pon Holdings B.V., also acquired a stake in Collect Car 
B.V., better known as “Greenwheels”. “Greenwheels” is the lead-
ing carsharing operator in the Netherlands, with around 2,000 
vehicles. The companies are planning to jointly take the business 
model forward, and in a subsequent step roll out activities in other 
countries, primarily in Europe. At the same time,  Volks wa gen New 
Mobility Services Investment Company China (VW NMS), a 100% 
subsidiary of  Volks wa gen Financial Services AG, has been piloting 
the VRent corporate carsharing model for companies and their 
employees since 2014. This is a brand new concept for China, 
 offering customers uncomplicated, flexible and direct access to a 
comprehensive fleet of vehicles in various categories. A tariff mod-
el based solely on usage, with monthly invoicing, ensures complete 
transparency and cost control.
As part of the “Electromobility Showcase” program, in November 
2014  Volks wa gen began providing selected universities in Lower 
Saxony with 50 e-up!• cars at attractive rates for carsharing. The 
aim is to gauge customers’ expectations of e-carsharing and estab-
lish what challenges this places on the infrastructure, the vehicle 
components or the business model, for example.  
 V  “INTERSECTION PILOT” RESEARCH PROJECT
The joint German research initiative UR:BAN (Urban Space: User- 
Friendly Assistance Systems and Network Management), scheduled 
to run until 2016, is designed to provide passenger car and commer-
cial vehicle drivers with anticipatory, intelligent, individual assis-
tance in urban traffic situations. As part of the “Smart Intersection” 
sub-project,  Volks wa gen is developing the Intersection Pilot, the 
first system to supply drivers with information about the next in-
tersection and support optimal driving maneuvers, helping to keep 
traffic flowing more smoothly and safely, and achieve a further cut 
in fuel consumption.
Reducing Traffic Noise
How best to provide individual mobility while at the same time re-
ducing noise pollution is a task for all stakeholders, and the 
 Volks wa gen Group is committed to playing its part. The  Volks wa gen 
brand is working intensively to further reduce noise emissions 
from its vehicles. At the  Volks wa gen Acoustics Center in Wolfs-
burg, noise minimization efforts focus on continuous optimiza-
tion of all aspects of the powertrain, the vehicle aerodynamics and 
tire/road noise. Noise emissions are a key factor in tire selection 
for every new vehicle across the Group. But the  Volks wa gen Group 
also goes one step further: in collaboration with Hamburger 
Lärmkontor GmbH (Germany), we have developed a noise tool to 
evaluate the effectiveness of noise abatement measures. Our noise 
research examines how individuals are impacted by noise, and we 
engage in ongoing dialogue with the affected community. This in-
cludes collaborating with local authorities and participating in 
the public debate, for example at the “DVWG Traffic Noise Forum” 
in 2014.

 V  SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY 2.0
As a long-standing member of the World Business Council for Sus-
tainable Development (WBCSD), we collaborate with other member 
companies in all industries on the “Sustainable Mobility 2.0” project 
to develop solutions for sustainable future urban mobility. Potential 
solutions must be both pragmatic and based on sound technical re-
search. The project entered its second year in 2014, kicking off a de-
bate about the findings from all six model cities around the globe.
After-Sales and Recycling
The processes introduced by the  Volks wa gen Group ensure that 
our vehicles are at least 85% recyclable, and 95% recoverable 
overall (in accordance with standard ISO 22628). These quotas 
have been verified using vehicles manufactured between 2007 
and 2012. Our strategy for meeting recycling and recovery quo-
tas, adopted in May 2007, continued to be implemented in 2014. 
The Vehicle Recycling Steering Group controls all relevant Group 
and brand activities.
The future recycling of electric vehicle batteries containing lithi-
um is today taken into account at the vehicle development stage. To 
this end, the  Volks wa gen brand has set up take-back systems for 
batteries and participated both in the joint project LithoRec I, 
completed in 2011, and the follow-on project LithoRec II, which is 
still ongoing. The recycling of lithium ion batteries is currently 
being tested. Since December 2013 we have also been involved in 
the research and development project ElmoReL2020 for the recy-
cling of power electronics from electric vehicles. By 2016, the 
 project partners are aiming to draw up recycling procedures for 
the key power electronics components.
In the field of commercial vehicles and power engineering, up-
stream of recycling, we are focusing on extending the life span of 
vehicles and plant by replacing components and upgrading effi-
ciency. MAN Truck & Bus professionally remanufactures used 
parts for use in vehicle repairs under the “MAN Originalteile® 
ecoline” brand. This helps to conserve resources, saves energy, 
and cuts costs by an average of 30%. Web-based training courses 
for vehicle workshops can be booked via the MAN Academy. Cus-
tomers in most parts of Europe also have access to an extensive 
portfolio of replacement and spare parts. MAN PrimeServ, the 
service brand of MAN Diesel & Turbo, has continuously refined its 
range of retrofits and upgrades to meet ever more stringent emis-
sions and environmental compatibility requirements. Retrofit 
solutions are amalgamated under the name PrimeServ-Green, 
and help to boost efficiency and reduce emissions in diesel en-
gines, marine propulsion systems, compressors and turbines. 
This service is offered by MAN Diesel & Turbo at 116 PrimeServ 
locations around the world.
 V  VOLKS WA GEN ORIGINAL PARTS CENTER
The Original Parts Center (OTC) is the largest of its kind in Europe. It 
opened in 1994 and has been growing ever since. With 500,000 m² 
of buildings, it now covers the equivalent of 70 football pitches. In 
addition to manufacturing components and handling the sale of 
original parts, the OTC also remanufactures used engines and gear-
boxes, thereby extending the service lives of our models. Since the 
OTC opened, it has saved some 351,000 t of steel and almost 49,000 
t of aluminum.
The Intersection Pilot supplies drivers with information about the next 
 intersection, helping to keep traffic flowing more smoothly and safely.

INDICATORS AND GOALS
OUR APPROACH 
 GRI G4-17, G4-22, G4-23
The principles of sustainability management in the  Volks wa gen 
Group are described in detail in the Strategy chapter (see page 20), 
as are our continuous improvement goals. Our goals and actions, 
together with planned activities and current status, are presented 
in greater detail at the end of this chapter (see pages 134 – 137). 
The table on page 117 provides an overview of Group-wide princi-
ples, agreements and methods, which form the basis for our 
shared  understanding of sustainability across the Group, allow-
ing performance to be measured, controlled and improved.
Management by Key Indicators
In order to manage its sustainability performance, the 
 Volks wa gen Group collects central performance indicators in 
line with the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and the ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) indicator 
framework of the European Federation of Financial Analysts So-
cieties (EFFAS). Shareholders and investors are increasingly de-
manding transparency, which makes them an important target 
group for our sustainability reporting. What follows is an over-
view of our economic, environmental and social performance 
which is as comprehensive as possible and stated in quantitative 
terms.
 V  Creating transparency in line  
with Global Reporting Initiative  
requirements.
The key indicators presented are a continuation of those from 
previous years. There have been no changes in reporting and 
measurement methods for our sustainability performance. The 
 Volks wa gen Group’s production network comprised 118 produc-
tion locations at the end of the reporting year. This figure is 
based on a revised and harmonized method of counting loca-
tions compared to the previous year, with the increase being 
largely accounted for by the commercial vehicle sector. This is 
now the third time that we have reported emissions in line with 
Scope 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG), which makes us 
trailblazer in our industry.
 V  Trailblazer in the industry in reporting 
emissions in line with Scope 3 of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
Frame of Reference
In principle, the indicators relate to the entire Group, including 
any companies in which our equity interest exceeds 50%. For our 
joint ventures in China, we report social indicators “at equity”, in 
other words 50%, but 100% of environmentally relevant data. 
However, due to differing definitions or collection methods, it is not 
yet possible in all areas to consolidate the data reported by the 
brands and regions, which means that there are still numerous ex-
ceptions. In this report, all indicators which are collected and con-
solidated across the Group are therefore marked with a symbol 
while those which are not marked with the symbol only relate to , 
parts of the Group, with footnotes explaining which parts. In the 
coming years, we will continue to endeavor to make data collection 
uniform for all locations and companies. 
Auditing and Standards
The  Volks wa gen Group Sustainability Report 2014 has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaft (PwC) against the relevant requirements and cri-
teria laid down in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
of the Global Reporting Initiative, taking supplementary ac-
count of the International Standard on Assurance Engage-
ments (ISAE) 3000. Audit activities which were carried out in-
clude: management surveys, surveys of employees responsible 
BECAUSE PERFORMANCE  
IS WHAT COUNTS. 
In this chapter we report on how our key financial, personnel and environmental indicators have 
developed over recent years. These indicators provide information on what has already been 
achieved, but they also point to where there is still room for improvement. The charts and figures 
are therefore followed by a presentation of our goals and an estimation of the extent to which 
those goals have so far been achieved.

PERSONNEL INDICATORS 
As at 31 December 2014, the  Volks wa gen Group, including the 
Chinese joint ventures, had 592,586 employees, 3.5% more 
than at the end of the 2013 financial year. Major factors in this 
rise were new hirings in growth markets, in particular in China, 
and the employment of specialists and experts, not least in Ger-
many. The distribution of Group employees between Germany 
and outside Germany remained virtually unchanged over the 
past year: as at the end of 2014, 45.7% of employees worked in 
Germany on the reporting date.

One of the Company’s goals is to continue to increase the propor-
tion of women from 15.7% across the Group, especially in man-
agement. In the reporting year, the proportion of women in man-
agement roles in the  Volks wa gen Group in Germany was 
increased to 8.3% among senior management and 11.7% in 
management, while among top management the proportion rose 
from 4.8% in 2013 to 5.7% in the reporting year (situation at year 
end, excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche). 
Due to its targeted recruitment measures, the  Volks wa gen Group 
employs a large proportion of well qualified employees. Some 97% 
of employees hold some form of qualification.

Low absenteeism calls for increased availability of diagnostic 
and screening measures. Absenteeism is calculated using the 
formula: number of days lost to illness or accident multiplied 
by 100, divided by total possible days’ attendance in the rele-
vant period. 
Since 2009, the average age at  Volks wa gen AG has been relatively 
constant, which is a sign of a healthy balance between recruit-
ment of employees on completion of their vocational education 
and training and retirement of long-serving employees. 
The employee turnover rate indicates the percentage of employees 
that leave the Company in the course of a year. As the chart shows, 
there is a very high level of stability in the  Volks wa gen workforce.

The accident frequency index is an indication of the frequency 
with which accidents at work occurred in relation to the total num-
ber of hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is: 
number of occupational accidents, multiplied by 1 million, divid-
ed by the number of hours worked. 
The accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents are 
by relating the total number of working days lost to the number of 
hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is: number of 
working days lost, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number 
of hours worked multiplied by ten.
The number of occupational accidents, the accident frequency 
 index and the accident severity index have risen in the  Volks wa gen 
Group. This is primarily due to the integration of a new company 
into the Group. 
The greatest improvements in accident frequency were achieved at 
 Volks wa gen do Brasil (Anchieta, Curitiba, Taubaté) and SEAT 
(Barcelona, Martorell). 
In 2014, one employee of the  Volks wa gen Group died as a result of 
an occupational accident.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS
This chapter presents selected environmental data for the 
 Volks wa gen Group in aggregated form. The data are collected, 
checked and approved at the production locations in line with an 
internal standard (VW standard 98 000). In order to improve the 
accuracy and consistency of the resultant information, the col-
lection of environmentally relevant consumption and emission 
data is subject to a continuous improvement process. This applies 
in particular to those items of information which have to be 
 recorded with the assistance of specific calculation algorithms. 
Moreover, the values for December of the preceding year may 
 include some estimated data, for example if they are based on bills 
from power suppliers or waste disposal providers which were not 
yet available at the time of compilation. In the next data collection 
round, these estimated data are then replaced with the values for 
December which have become available in the meantime. 
In a similar way to corporate environmental strategy monitor-
ing, the reported time series are relative to the 2010 baseline. 
The current reporting year and the corresponding preceding 
year complete the reporting period. 
Overall, the environmental data are collected from production 
 locations with some 550,000 employees (as at December 31, 2014), 
which equates to a proportion of around 97 percent. In addition, the 
production locations in Ningbo (Shanghai- Volks wa gen Automotive 
Company Ltd.), Foshan (FAW- Volks wa gen Automotive Company 
Ltd.) and Foshan ( Volks wa gen FAW Platform Company Ltd.) were 
included in the data collection for 2014.
The data in the “car and light commercial vehicle” category for 
the years 2010, 2013 and 2014 are recorded as in the  Volks wa gen 
Group’s Annual Report. The data for the brands Scania AB, MAN 
SE, Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. and VW Kraftwerk GmbH are 
reported in the “Other divisions” category. 
The respective proportions are indicated separately in the 
graphs. Unless indicated otherwise, all the Group’s production 
locations and the power stations and boiler plants operated by 
 Volks wa gen AG at the Wolfsburg, Kassel and Hanover locations 
in Germany are included in both categories. The  Volks wa gen 
Group is essentially an automotive manufacturer which produc-
es cars and light commercial vehicles as well as heavy-duty com-
mercial vehicles and buses. MAN SE does, however, also manu-
facture marine engines or power station components. Due to this 
product diversity, the entirety of the environmental impact can-
not simply be related to the volume of vehicles produced. Relative 
indicators are thus only stated for the “car and light commercial 
vehicle” category. The number of vehicles produced in 2014 to-
taled 10,014,282 cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as 
198,280 heavy-duty commercial vehicles. 
The influence of increasing production volumes is reflected in an 
increase in absolute values for many indicators. However, thanks 
to increased efficiency, an improvement in specific values has 
been achieved for many indicators. A high level of capacity utili-
zation of the production locations has also had a positive impact 
on specific indicators. 
Weather conditions have an appreciable, but uncontrollable, im-
pact on consumption of resources. This primarily relates to space 
heating demand, both for production for non-production sec-
tors, since changing annual average temperatures have an im-
pact on direct consumption of energy sources as well as on the 
amount of purchased energy. Various aspects thus exert an influ-
ence on the specific values. On the one hand, absolute consump-
tion or emission values may change, while on the other hand ris-
ing or falling production volumes at the individual production 
locations also influence the indicators.

Over the reporting period shown, a continuous reduction in spe-
cific energy consumption per vehicle was achieved. As a result of 
higher production volumes, absolute energy consumption rose, 
but with a slight decline in the rate of increase compared to the 
previous year. 
The proportion of electrical energy has risen continuously over 
the reporting period, but measures to increase efficiency re-
duced the proportion per vehicle produced. Heat consumption is 
subdivided into heating demand for heating production and 
non-production sectors, and heating demand for industrial pro-
cesses. Since space heating accounts for the greater proportion 
of total heating  demand, weather conditions have a major impact 
on trends in overall heating demand. 
Accordingly, 2014’s above-average temperatures had a positive 
influence on heat consumption. 
In addition to this influence, measures to increase efficiency 
 reduced the specific value per vehicle. 
Fuel gases for production processes are mainly used for industri-
al processes during production. For example, they are used as 
combustion fuels for operating industrial afterburning facilities 
in paintshops or in annealing furnaces in component manufac-
ture. Consumption of these fuel gases thus increases with rising 
 production volumes. Thanks to implementation of the Group’s 
 resource conservation strategy, fuel gas consumption figures 
relative to production volume have been reduced.

Despite increased production volumes and the inclusion of new 
production locations, with a consequent increase in energy con-
sumption, direct CO2 emissions have been falling since 2010. 
Direct CO2 emissions are associated with the combustion of 
 fossil energy sources. A positive trend in CO2 emission factors 
from in-house energy supplies has a positive impact on the trend 
in direct emissions of CO2. Resource-optimized manufacturing 
processes have also played a part in this positive trend in direct 
CO2 emissions.

Total CO2 emissions have risen due to increased consumption of 
electrical energy, heat and fuel gases for production. The rise in 
total CO2 emissions is, however, limited due to increased use of 
renewably generated energy and the associated improvement 
in CO2 emission factors. 
By using suitable CO2 emission factors to evaluate energy and 
heat consumption figures for production locations, the CO2 
emissions arising from power and heat generation for 
 Volks wa gen AG’s production locations in power stations and 
boiler plants operated by  Volks wa gen AG are included in the to-
tal volume of CO2 emissions. 
The stated carbon dioxide emissions do not include the emis-
sions arising from district heating and power supplied to third 
parties from power stations operated by  Volks wa gen AG. For 
2014, these emissions amounted to 297,371 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide. 
A continuous reduction in CO2 emissions per vehicle produced 
was achieved over the stated reporting period. 
The “Other divisions” category also includes CO2 emissions 
from the manufacture of heavy-duty commercial vehicles, 
which account for around 75 percent of total CO2 emissions in 
this category.

CO2 equivalents are calculated on the basis of the specific global 
warming potentials of individual, emitted refrigerants. Since 
such emissions do not occur continuously and are not dependent 
on a location’s production volume, relatively large fluctuations 
may arise over a time series. 
127
INDICATORS AND GOALS
128
In line with the Scope 3 standard published in 2011 by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World 
 Resources Institute,  Volks wa gen reports CO2 emissions for twelve 
out of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories. The calculations have 
 revealed that the “purchased goods and services” and “use phase” 
emission categories account for more than 93% of all Scope 3 
emissions. CO2 emissions in the use phase are calculated on the 
basis of a Group fleet value representing the global vehicle popu-
lation in the four major regions (EU28, USA, Brazil and China). 
In view of the preponderance of these two categories, the rele-
vant data were the subject of separate audits by external auditors 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers in compliance with audit stand-
ard ISAE 3000 “International Standard on Assurance Engage-
ments”.

There was a clear decline in NOx emissions in the 2010 to 2014 
period. 
The sharp decline in direct sulfur dioxide emissions in 2014 is 
the result of changes in ownership of a power generation plant.

Coating processes account for the majority of VOC emissions. 
Modern paintshops use coating and process materials which 
contain less solvents. In addition, steps are taken during the 
coating process to collect or eliminate any solvents which are 
emitted. This is achieved, for example, by thermal afterburning 
of the exhaust air from the dryers, which are downstream of the 
actual coating process. Emissions into the environment are de-
termined on the basis of both instrumental measurements and 
calculations. 
The complexity of the overall coating process and new insights 
into determination methods may result in adjustments being 
made to previously determined emission values. The result is, 
however, always a higher degree of accuracy of the recorded 
 environmental data. 
Increased vehicle production volumes and an increase in the 
 associated coating operations resulted in a slight rise in abso-
lute VOC emissions over the entire reporting period. Due to the 
influencing factors described above, emissions per vehicle pro-
duced fell over the reporting period. 
INDICATORS AND GOALS

As a result of higher production volumes over the reporting peri-
od, larger volumes of hazardous and non-hazardous waste were 
also generated, while the proportion of waste for disposal has 
been reduced from around 31% in 2010 to around 23% in 2014. 
In contrast, the proportion of waste for recycling has been in-
creased from around 69% in 2010 to around 77% in 2014. The 
increase in the proportion of recycled waste is also the result of 
the Group’s waste strategy, the first stage of which targets high-
er recycling rates. The second stage of this strategy is in the in-
troductory phase and targets the reduction of total volumes of 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste per vehicle. 
The absolute quantity of metallic “waste”, which in the light of 
its high recycling rate can be considered to be a valuable materi-
al, has increased in absolute terms over the reporting period as 
a whole due to increased production volumes across the Group. 
The volume of metallic waste per vehicle, however, has been 
 reduced by improvements in material utilization and resource- 
optimized manufacturing processes.

Due to increased production across the Group, there was a rise in 
the wastewater parameter chemical oxygen demand, both in abso-
lute terms and per vehicle produced. This parameter is an indica-
tor of the level of contamination of wastewater. 
Depending on where wastewater is purified, a distinction is drawn 
between locations which, as indirect dischargers, discharge 
wastewater into municipal sewers for further purification, and 
those locations which, as direct dischargers, carry out wastewater 
treatment in-house and discharge the purified wastewater direct-
ly into a body of water. In 2014, indirectly discharging locations 
accounted for 92% (2010: 91%; 2013: 92%) of the Group’s total 
wastewater volumes (excluding MAN SE and Scania AB).

Given the increase in production volumes of cars and light com-
mercial vehicles, consumption of freshwater has also risen con-
tinuously over the last five years. The construction of new loca-
tions has made a major contribution to the increase in 
consumption over this period. Despite the increased number of 
Group locations, freshwater consumption per vehicle has been 
reduced by around 6.8% over the reporting period. This has been 
achieved by numerous recycling measures including reuse of 
used water in coating processes. 
Wastewater volumes show a similar trend to freshwater. Thanks to 
the introduction of increasing numbers of waterless manufactur-
ing processes and water recycling, wastewater volumes per car 
and light commercial vehicle produced have been reduced by 
around 10.1% over the reporting period. For instance, purified 
wastewater from an evaporator is reused for cleaning workshop 
floors.

The environmental protection costs of  Volks wa gen AG’s German 
locations are shown above. 
Both capital and operating costs for environmental protection 
have risen over the reporting period. This is also reflected in the 
specific environmental costs per manufactured vehicle. 
 Volks wa gen breaks down expenditure for environmental protec-
tion measures in “Capital expenditure and operating costs for 
 production-related environmental protection”. Of total capital 
 expenditure, only those items which are solely or predominantly 
dedicated to environmental protection are counted as capital 
 expenditure for environmental protection. A distinction is drawn 
between additive and integrated capital expenditure. Additive 
 environmental protection measures are separate plants isolated 
from the remainder of the production process. They may be locat-
ed upstream or downstream of the manufacturing process. In 
contrast to additive environmental protection facilities, in inte-
grated measures the environmental impact is mitigated while the 
product is being produced. The focus of environmental protection 
in 2014 was on water quality management. 
The indicated operating costs solely concern production-related 
environmental protection measures which help to conserve the 
“environment” as a protected resource from harmful impact by 
avoiding, reducing or eliminating emissions from the Company’s 
activities. Operating costs include, for example, expenditure for 
the operation of plant and equipment that serves to protect the 
 environment, as well as expenditure for measures not related to 
plant and equipment. The priorities in 2014 were water quality 
management, waste management and air pollution control.

The locations stated here are the  Volks wa gen brand’s production 
locations in Germany and the rest of Europe which are located 
in the vicinity of protected sites pursuant to Council Directive 
92/43/EEC of May 21, 1992 on the conservation of natural habi-
tats and of wild fauna and flora (The Habitats Directive). 
The development of particulate emissions in the passenger car 
and light commercial vehicle category at the Group’s production 
locations in Germany is related not least to the increase in unit out-
put. In addition, at one production location temporary above- 
average emission values were determined which have since been 
reduced by means of appropriate measures.

Participation 
Enhance performance and ensure all employees share in 
success: establish three-part pay system with basic pay, 
performance-related component and entitlement to 
profit-sharing as Group standard 
ongoing
In 2014, employees at more than 30 Group 
locations benefited from profit-sharing, including 
those at  Volks wa gen locations in Spain, Poland, 
Russia, Mexico and China.
Health
Promote health, fitness and ergonomics: extension of the 
Checkup and follow-up screening and training programs
ongoing
The Checkup is now established at all German and 
many international sites. For example, over 18,000 
Checkups were carried out at ŠKODA AUTO a.s. in 
the Czech Republic in 2014.
Promote health, fitness and ergonomics: continuous 
improvement of preventive health measures and training 
provision
ongoing
The “Fit in the Factory” program aims to reduce 
physical stresses and strains for those working on 
the shop floor. Between May 2013 and June 2014, 
some 15,700 employees completed one of these 
programs at  Volks wa gen in Wolfsburg.
Occupational Safety
Improve Group occupational safety management system 
at all production locations
ongoing
An audit of the Group occupational safety 
management system was carried out successfully 
during 2014 at the following locations: São Carlos 
(Brazil), Curitiba (Brazil), Pamplona (Spain) and

 Volks wa gen Group in Germany; female graduates to 
account for 30% of graduate recruitment in the   
Volks wa gen Group in Germany
ongoing
In 2014 around 30% of graduate recruits at   
Volks wa gen AG were female. In the medium to long 
term this will lead to an increase in the proportion 
of women in management roles with the    
Volks wa gen Group in Germany. In 2014, for 
example, the proportion of women in management 
within the  Volks wa gen Group in Germany rose 
from 9.8% in 2013 to 10.2%.

BACKGROUND
G R I  I N D E X
The present sustainability report takes account of the fourth edition (G4) of the reporting 
 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in line with the “Comprehensive” option. At 
the same time, we set out how we implement the requirements of the United Nations Global 
 Compact (UN GC) and of the German Sustainability Code (GSC). A full overview of the GRI Index 
is  available on the microsite.

To  Volks wa gen AG, Wolfsburg
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the description of the necessary 
materiality analysis for a sustainability report and selected issues of the Corporate Responsibility 
 Report 2014 of the  Volks wa gen AG, Wolfsburg, (hereinafter: the Company), for the business year from 
January, 1st to December, 31st 2014.1 The sustainability information, which were selected by the 
 Company and reviewed by us, are marked with the following symbols (
 
 
 
) in the Sustainability 
Report. 
Management’s Responsibility 
 > The company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the accurate preparation of the Sustain-
ability Report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Sustain-
ability Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which 
are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing 
and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the report. 
Our Independence and Quality Control 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for 
 Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA- 
Codex), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, pro-fessional competence 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. 
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehen-
sive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Practitioner’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed as to whether anything has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that:
 
 > the marked (
) description of the materiality analysis is necessary for a sustainability report to deter-
mine its content and the boundaries of its aspects is not in accordance with the criteria “Stakeholder 
Inclusiveness”, “Sustainability Context”, “Materiality” and “Completeness” of the GRI’s Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 and that they were not used during the Sustainability Report’s preparation,
 > the management approaches marked with (
 
 and 
) in the Sustainability Report are not in accord-
ance with the requirements of the standard disclosures G4-DMA of the Sustainability Reporting Guide-
lines Vol. 4 or that 
 > the quantitative information marked with (
 and 
) in the Company’s Sustainability Report for 
the business year 2014 , is in material aspects not in accordance with the criteria “Completeness”, 
“Comparability”, “Accuracy”, “Clarity”, “Timeliness” and “Reliability” of the GRI’s Sustainability 
 Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4.

 Our engagement applies to the German paper version of the Sustainability- Report. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance 
Report issued in German language - the German text is au-thoritative.

BACKGROUND
It was not part of our engagement to review any additional information outside the scope of the given 
 information or statements. 
We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development of the sustainability 
management and the sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
assurance engagement, under consideration of materiality, in order to provide our conclusion with limit-
ed assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a 
 reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assur-
ance engagement. 
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures concerning the 
 materiality analysis, management approaches and key data – for the aspects that are marked by a 
check (
 
 
 
) in the Sustainability Report.
 
 > Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the report regarding the process to prepare 
the reporting of sustainability information and the underlying internal control system;
 > Understanding the Company regarding to its sustainability organizational structure, stakeholder 
 dialogue and development process of the sustainability program;
 > Recording of the systems and processes for collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of sustaina-
bility data and their documentation on a sample basis;
 > Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and aggregat-
ing selected data at:
 > Skoda Auto a.s., Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic;
 >  Volks wa gen do Brasil Indústria de Veículos Automotores Ltda., Anchieta, Brazil;
 > FAW- Volks wa gen Automotive Company Ltd., Changchun, China
 >  Volks wa gen Group China, Peking, China 
 > Analytical procedures on relevant data;
 > Comparison of corresponding data in the Company‘s Consolidated Financial Statements 2014;
 > Gaining further evidence for selected data of the report through inspection of internal documents, 
 contracts and invoices. 
Conclusion 
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that 
 > the marked (
) description of the materiality analysis, which is necessary for a sustainability report to 
 determine its content and the boundaries of its aspects, is not in accordance with the criteria “Stakeholder 
Inclusiveness”, “Sustainability Context”, “Materiality” and “Completeness” of the GRI’s Sustainability 
 Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 and that they were not used during the report’s preparation, 
 > the management approaches marked with (
 
 
)  in the Sustainability Report are not in accordance 
with the requirements of the standard disclosures G4-DMA of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
Vol. 4 or that 
 > the quantitative information marked with (
 and 
) in the Company’s Sustainability Report for 
the  business year 2014 is in material aspects not in accordance with the criteria “Completeness”, 
“Com parability”, “Accuracy”, “Clarity”, “Timeliness” and “Reliability” of the GRI’s Sustainability 
 Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4.

Emphasis of Matter - Recommendations 
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further devel-
opment of the Company’s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:

A B O UT  TH I S  R E P O R T 
The  Volks wa gen Group’s Sustainability Report has been published 
annually since 2011. This report contains information about the 
Group’s sustainability activities in the 2014 financial year (January 
1 to December 31, 2014). The report, which is available in German 
and English, went to press on January 31, 2015. The next Group 
Sustainability Report will be published in the second quarter of 
2016.
The Strategy chapter presents the fundamentals of the Group’s 
strategy for implementing sustainable development across all its 
brands. The Economy, People and Environment chapters set out 
our management approach in each case before outlining how the 
various aspects of these topics are implemented. The key Group-
wide indicators and the overarching corporate sustainability 
roadmap are described in the Indicators and Goals chapter. Signif-
icant changes in holdings or in the data acquisition process are 
 described on pages 5 and 116. True to the character of a progress 
report we aim to focus on the essentials while at the same time com-
municating a balanced picture of our activities that takes account 
of all Group brands and companies. Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania 
and ŠKODA publish their own sustainability reports, either annu-
ally or at two-year intervals.
FUNDAMENTALS
This report was drawn up in accordance with the fourth generation 
of guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G4) with the 
aid of an IT system that is to be used for Group-wide data acquisition 
and control activities, as well as for stakeholder management within 
the Group. Important guidance in terms of content was provided by 
the questionnaires and appraisals of sustainability-oriented rating 
agencies and RobecoSAM in particular. We also took our lead from 
Stakeholder Engagement Standard AA1000.
To identify material topics for the  Volks wa gen Group resulting from 
the global challenges, we drew upon the findings of the  Volks wa gen 
Group’s Stakeholder Panel which has been in place for many years 
now, as well as on the latest comprehensive stakeholder surveys con-
ducted by Group companies Audi, MAN, Porsche and  Volks wa gen 
Financial Services. The resultant materiality matrix (see page 17) 
was validated by the Corporate CSR & Sustainability Steering 
Group. The present report takes account not only of the recommen-
dations of the Stakeholder Panel, following its evaluation of the 
2013 Group Sustainability Report (see pages 25 – 26), but also of the 
advice provided by the auditors.
STANDARDS
This report has been approved by the Board of Management of 
 Volks wa gen Aktiengesellschaft and verified by a firm of auditors 
(see pages 145 – 147). The GRI has confirmed the location of the 
 indicators G4-17 to G4-27 through its Materiality Disclosure 
 Service (see page 138). Compliance with the GRI indicators is 
shown in the GRI Content Index on pages 138 – 143, as is the 
 implementation of the relevant criteria for the Communication on 
Progress to the United Nations Global Compact. The GRI Content 
Index also documents compliance with the German Sustainability 
Code.

Despite difficult economic conditions in 2016, the Group sold 
10,391,113 (2015: 10,009,605) vehicles to dealers. The Group’s share 
of the global passenger car market currently stands at 11.9%. The 
Group maintained its strong competitive position in the reporting 
period thank to its wide range of attractive and environmentally 
friendly models. Worldwide, for the manufacture of its products, the 
the MAN and Scania brands is managed and coordinated under the 
umbrella of Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH. The commercial vehicles 
portfolio ranges from pickups to heavy trucks and buses. Power 
Engineering manufactures large-bore diesel engines and special gear 
units, among other things. A wide array of financial services, which 
will be gradually expanded to include mobility services rounds off 
the Company’s portfolio. With its brands, the Volkswagen Group has 
a presence in all relevant markets around the world, with Western 
Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey currently represent-

Year for year, the Volkswagen Group invests more in research and development 
than any other company in the world, laying the foundations for new models 
and innovative concepts with which to master the challenges of the future: 
digitization, networking and electric mobility.
Every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of 43,000 vehi-
cles. As we do so, efficient production ranks alongside employee health and safety as 
our core goal. New concepts help prepare employees for the future, covering every 
step from vocational education and training onwards.
Service provision includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality 
advice and maintenance; managing the original parts business; and providing 
innovative vehicle-related financial services. Fuel-economy driver training courses 
play an effective part in cutting fuel consumption and thus Co2 emissions.
recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ impact on the  
environment and conserving resources. It is not just a matter of recycling vehicles 
at the end of their service life – on the contrary, even at the development stage  
for new vehicles, we pay attention to the recyclability of the required materials, 
the use of high-quality recycled material and the avoidance of pollutants. At  
the same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, such as the treatment and 
disposal of service fluids or high-wear components.
Every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, compo-
nents and other goods. A sustainable supply chain and environmentally compatible 
transportation solutions form an indispensable part of demonstrating comprehen-
sive responsibility for human rights, as well as a commitment to the environment 
and to the battle against corruption.
The Volkswagen Group markets its vehicles in 153 countries. Around the world, 
comfort and safety are considered the key customer requirements. We continuously 
reduce the fuel consumption of our models and offer alternative mobility services.

STrATEGY     OUR OBjECTIVE –  TO PROVIDE SUSTAINABlE MOBIlITy
Strategy 
Our Objective –  
To Provide Sustainable Mobility
As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, our Group bears a special social responsibility. We intend to put our 
creative powers to good use for the benefit of people and the environment. Every year we produce more than 10 million 
vehicles. This gives rise to positive effects such as new jobs, regional prosperity and individual opportunities for partici-
pation – but also to negative impacts such as emissions and resource consumption. In view of the growing trend toward 
digitalization, we will in the future be faced with new issues – for example, what we do with our customers’ data, how 
we ensure that they are secure and protected at all times, and what legal and ethical problems are raised by automated 
driving. It is our task to ensure responsible and efficient production, and to make mobility not only as safe, convenient 
and environmentally compatible as possible, but at the same time affordable for large numbers of people. After all, indi-
vidual mobility remains a basic human need, and fulfilling this need is the main mission of our Group.
With its future program ToGETHEr – Strategy 2025, the Volkswagen Group has launched the biggest change process in 
its history, laying the foundations for lasting success in tomorrow’s world of mobility and for its evolution into a globally 
leading provider of sustainable mobility.

STrATEGY     lETTER TO OUR STAKEHOlDERS
Dear Readers and Colleagues,
These are not normal times for Volkswagen. you can even sense this 
in the timing of our reports – our sustainability report for 2015 only 
appeared toward the end of November 2016. 
But now we are back on schedule, so to speak. We are pleased to  
present our report for 2016 in good time for our annual general meet-
ing. However, this does not mean that everything is back to normal  
at  our Company. There is no question that in terms of corporate 
res ponsibility, dealing with the repercussions of the diesel crisis is still 
one of our top priorities. Each of the key developments over the past 
12 months has been given its own dedicated chapter in this report.
Corporate responsibility is also about running our business prudently 
and successfully. Together with our entire workforce, we can be 
proud that in an extremely challenging year, we met and exceeded 
our operational objectives. At the same time, in mid-2016, we intro-
duced our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 program. This represents our 
vision for the future, guiding our actions, defining specific targets 
and detailing how we should achieve them. We intend to become a  
world-leading provider of sustainable mobility. low-emission drive 
technologies; smart mobility services; innovative, safe solutions for 
autonomous driving – these are among the ambitious plans we are 
working on right now as we look ahead to the future. you will find 
more details in this report.
We are undergoing a profound and challenging – yet at the same 
time, extraordinarily exciting – transformation. This in turn poses 
an important question: how do we want to work together in the fu-
ture? This is one of the issues addressed in our TOGETHER strategy, 
in which we launch a transformation of our corporate culture that 
may be unique in the history of Volkswagen. This will result in flatter 
hierarchies, decentralized decision-making and an open, collabora-
tive style of working that explicitly encourages constructive criticism, 
while simultaneously encouraging all our employees to think and 
act like responsible entrepreneurs. As we pursue this radical trans-
formation, our managers bear special responsibility – they must lead 
by example and work closely with their teams to bring about this 
sweeping cultural change. 
When we talk about openness, we also mean that we intend to pay 
even greater attention to how our stakeholders, as well as outside 
experts, view our work. With this aim in mind, we set up our Group 
Sustainability Council in late 2016. Nine respected experts from the 
worlds of politics, research and NGOs are now advising us on issues 
Letter to our Stakeholders
such as sustainable mobility, environmental protection and the 
future of work. The council has already started its activities and is in 
the process of developing its first projects. We stay in close contact 
with council members and look forward to the many ideas they will 
generate.
Over the last year, Volkswagen also substantially extended the 
 Company’s voluntary commitment to behave ethically and with 
integrity. One outcome of this was the creation of a new position  
on our Board of Management. Hiltrud Werner, an outstanding 
expert and former head of Group Internal Audit, has taken on the 
challenging role of Board Member for Integrity and legal Affairs 
following the departure of Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt.
The Volkswagen Group is changing, just as the automotive industry 
as a whole is changing. As we see it, developments over the next 
ten years will be even more far-reaching than the changes we have 
seen in the last 100 years. This makes it all the more essential for us 
to establish a solid framework of values, in the form of our renewed 
commitment to sustainable, responsible business practices. 
This report is an expression of this commitment. In a spirit of trans-
parency, accountability and comparability, the statements, figures 
and data included in this report follow the guidelines of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) of the United Nations. The report also represents our Com-
munication on Progress under the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC).
We look forward to receiving your suggestions and feedback,

STrATEGY     OUR APPROACH 
For Volkswagen, sustainability means pursuing economic, social 
and ecological objectives simultaneously and with equal energy. It 
is our aim to create lasting values, offer good working conditions, 
and conserve resources and the environment. When it comes to the 
diesel crisis, we have failed to live up to our own standards in several 
areas. The irregularities in the handling of emissions tests contra-
dict  everything that we stand for. We regret this immensely and are 
aware that we have let our stakeholders down. We will do every-
thing in our power to prevent incidents of this kind from reoccurring, 
and are fully committed to re-embracing our standards and winning 
back public trust. We continue to apply our sustainability concept 
with the aim of ensuring that opportunities and risks associated 
with our environmental, social and governance activities are identi-
fied as early as possible at every stage of the value creation process. 
In keeping with this aim, we are determined that our corporate 
social responsibility activities will have a lasting, positive impact on 
the Company’s value and reputation.
The automotive world is undergoing a profound transformation, 
and automated driving, e-mobility and connected vehicle concepts 
are the dominant trends. Technological changes are influencing 
customer needs and business models; new competitors are entering 
the market from other industries; shorter innovation cycles and the 
establishment of new core competencies are requiring ever more 
capital; stricter emission standards and increased market volatility 
are leading to more complex underlying conditions. All this poses 
new challenges for us as a vehicle manufacturer.
Against this backdrop, in june 2016 the Volkswagen Group Board 
of Management launched our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 program 
for the future, with the full approval of the Supervisory Board. It is 
our aim to play a decisive role in shaping the mobility not just of 
today, but of tomorrow as well. This is why we are repositioning our 
Company with the vision of becoming one of the world’s leading 
providers of sustainable mobility. Our future program will make the 
Volkswagen Group more focused, efficient, innovative and sustain-
able – bringing us closer to our customers and setting us on a steady 
course of profitable growth.

2025 effectively bridges the conceptual gap between sustainability 
and business objectives. It creates the framework and defines the 
key building blocks for the future evolution of the Group, with its 
strong brands, international production sites and skilled, dedicat-
ed workforce. The Code of Collaboration formulated as part of our 
future program is the foundation on which the Group strategy rests. 
The Code describes how collaboration is to take place within the 
Group and between individuals in their daily work. Its core values 
are encapsulated in the terms “open and honest”, “uncomplicated”, 
“without prejudice”, “on an equal footing” and “for one another”. 
The change process is complemented by the corresponding strate-
gies of the brands and functions.

STrATEGY     OUR APPROACH 
The new Group strategy comprises a raft of far-reaching strategic de-
cisions and specific initiatives essentially aimed at safeguarding the 
Group’s long-term future and generating profitable growth. A total 
of 16 strategic Group initiatives are assigned to the four key building 
blocks of the program, which are: comprehensively transforming 
our core automotive business; establishing a new mobility solutions 
business; strengthening the Group’s innovative power; and securely 
funding our investments.
First key building block: transforming our core business
Developing, building and selling vehicles will remain essential for  
the Volkswagen Group going forward. However, there will be far- 
reaching and lasting changes to this business. That is why we are 
profoundly restructuring our core business to face this new era of 
mobility.
Second key building block: establishing a mobility solutions business
The second key building block of the new Group strategy is the new 
cross-brand mobility solutions business, in which we are setting up 
mobility services. In this context, we have established MOIA, a new 
business unit which will focus on ride hailing. Subsequently, we are 
aiming to develop or acquire further attractive and profitable ser-
vices that are tailored to customer requirements, such as robotaxis, 
carsharing and on-demand transport for the logistics industry. To 
achieve this, we will rely to a greater extent than previously on part-
nerships, acquisitions and venture capital investments. Investment 
selection will be managed centrally so as to generate maximum 
value for the Group and its brands.
MOIA – Rethinking mobility
The automotive industry is undergoing rapid change. Along-
side the traditional automotive business, innovative, digitally 
connected mobility services promise a high growth dynamic. 
Together with newly founded company MOIA, Volkswagen is 
laying the foundations for sustained success in tomorrow’s 
world of mobility throughout the Group and across all brands. 
Individual mobility for everyone – this is what MOIA stands 
for. Convenient, at the touch of a button, at affordable prices 
and without having to own your own car. As a first step, the 
app-based ride-hailing business sector shows the greatest  
potential for MOIA. The Volkswagen Group has already 
opened the way for new mobility concepts with its stake in  
Gett, one of the world’s leading ride-hailing providers. Gett 
app users can already instantly book rides, deliveries and 
logistics services at the touch of a button in more than 
100 cities worldwide. At the same time, MOIA is also focusing 
on a second major business activity, namely the ride-pooling 
business. The company’s goal is to set up its own app-based 
on-demand ride-pooling services – also known as connected 
commuting. It is aiming for holistic transport solutions that 
make individual and public transport more efficient by avoid-
ing unnecessary individual journeys and optimizing the use  
of existing road infrastructure. This approach concentrates 
on transport that takes users beyond the boundaries of a 
single city.
SEDRIC – Automated driving at the touch of a button
In the future, fully automated vehicles will enrich the mobility  
experience of many people. A mobility concept based on 
intensively used self-driving vehicles will take up less space, 
consume less energy, and be safer and more sustainable at 
the same time. And the concept offers tailor-made mobility 
for everyone: adults and children, senior citizens and people 
with physical disabilities, urban residents who do not have 
their own cars or driving licenses, and visitors to a new city 
who suddenly decide they want a convenient way to get from 
A to B. 
With SEDRIC (self-driving car), the Volkswagen Group has not 
only developed a completely new, fully autonomous concept 
car, but also an integrated mobility concept showing how we 
will use our roads in the future. A cross-brand ideas platform 
for the Volkswagen Group, SEDRIC, which features an inno-
vative control system, is giving entirely new meaning to the 
concept of automated driving. The touch of a button, a verbal 
command or a smartphone app is enough to summon the 
self-driving automobile, which comes and takes its passen-
gers conveniently, reliably and safely to their destination.

STrATEGY     OUR APPROACH 
Third key building block: strengthening innovative power
Both the transformation of our core business and the new mobil-
ity solutions business require us to strengthen our traditionally 
excellent ability to innovate and place it on an even broader footing. 
To this end, the Volkswagen Group is pushing ahead with the digital 
transformation of all parts of the Company.
Fourth key building block: secure funding
Becoming one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable 
mobility calls for substantial capital expenditure. This expenditure 
is to be funded primarily through efficiency gains across all brands 
and functions; operational excellence is something that concerns 
the entire value chain, from product development and sourcing to 
production and distribution. Additional funds for future invest-
ments can also be generated by optimizing the existing portfolio  
of brands and equity investments.
Goals and key performance indicators of the Group’s strategy
The strategic initiatives describe how we intend to achieve our vision 
of becoming a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility. For 
this purpose, we have defined four target dimensions – excited cus-
tomers, excellent employer, role model for environment, safety and 
integrity, and competitive profitability – which are designed to help 
us grow sustainably.
Target dimension: excited customers
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our customers 
and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to exceed our  
customers’ expectations, generating maximum benefit for them. 
That calls not only for the best products, the most efficient solutions 
and the best service, but also for flawless quality and an outstand ing 
image. We want to excite our existing customers, win over new  
ones and retain their loyalty in the long term – because only loyal 
and faithful customers will recommend us to others.
The strategic KPIs include, for example, the loyalty rate, conquest 
rate and breakdowns.
Target dimension: excellent employer
Skilled and dedicated employees are one of the keys to sustainable 
success. We wish to promote their satisfaction and motivation by 
means of equal opportunities, a modern and attractive working  
environment, and a forward-looking work organization. An exemplary 
leadership and corporate culture forms the basis for this, enabling  
us to retain our core workforce and attract new talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension include the Group’s 
attractiveness as an employer as determined internally by means 
of the opinion survey and as perceived externally, as well as the 
equality index.
Target dimension: role model for the environment,  
safety and integrity
Every day, we at the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise re-
sponsibility in relation to the environment, safety and society. This 
sense of responsibility informs all our thoughts and actions in equal 
measure in all the decisions we make.
We pay particular attention to the use of resources and the emis-
sions of our product portfolio as well as those of our locations and 
plants, with the goal of continuously reducing our carbon footprint 
and lowering pollutant emissions. Through our innovations and  
outstanding quality, we offer our customers maximum product safety.
We want to regain and strengthen the trust of our customers and 
restore the Group’s positive public image. The most important princi-
ples in this process include compliance with laws and regulations,  
the establishment of secure processes, and dealing openly with mis-
takes so that they can be avoided or rectified in the future. In terms 
of integrity, Volkswagen aims to become a role model for a modern, 
transparent and successful enterprise.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension include the decarbon-
ization index and emissions metrics, as well as compliance, process 
reliability and an error management culture.
Target dimension: competitive profitability
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations  
as regards interest payments and debt repayments. As equity holders, 
they expect adequate dividends and a lasting increase in the value 
of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth 
and strengthening our competitiveness, thus keeping the Volkswagen  
Group on a firm footing and ensuring it remains an attractive invest-
ment option.
The goals we have set ourselves are to achieve operational excel-
lence in all business processes and to become the benchmark for the 
entire industry.
The strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen Group 
figures.

SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY
GRI G4-18 
Mobility is one of the key conditions for economic growth. The latest 
challenge is to cater to the growing demand for mobility despite 
diminishing resources and, in the process, reduce its negative effects 
on the environment. Holistic mobility concepts have to be efficient, 
sustainable, customer-oriented and, above all else, designed in 
such a way that they are accessible anytime and anywhere. We at 
Volkswagen are researching and developing groundbreaking mobility 
solutions for our customers that will shape the future in this area.  
We do not limit our focus to automotive mobility, but take in other 
modes of transport as well and examine structural issues such 
as urbanization, urban development and the quality of transport 
infrastructure. We also take account of demand trends, such as the 
shared use of vehicles.
It is our goal to provide our customers around the globe with viable, 
long-term mobility solutions that place equal priority on economic, 
social and ecological objectives. To offer such solutions, a company 
must operate sustainably – which means developing sustainable 
technologies and creating an environment in which they are applied 
in a sustainable manner. This is our understanding of sustainable 
mobility.

STrATEGY     OUR APPROACH 
However, the economic, social and environmental requirements 
placed on our mobility solutions often contain inherently conflicting 
goals, as can be seen in some of the examples discussed below: 
 § Individual mobility solutions facilitate participation in society and 
individual autonomy. In the future, many people will still want 
their own cars – despite the continuously increasing availability  
of innovative mobility concepts such as robotaxis and carsharing.  
This applies particularly in the growing consumer markets of emer-
ging and developing countries. However, the desire for individual 
mobility also contributes to increased consumption of natural 
resources and accelerates the process of human-made climate 
change.
 § The enormous market success of SUVs underscores the attractive-
ness of Volkswagen products. Fulfilling these existing customer 
wishes safeguards the economic success of the Volkswagen Group 
and provides job security to its employees. But the higher fuel 
consumption of SUVs compared with other vehicle models makes 
it more difficult for the Volkswagen Group to meet the climate 
targets it has set.
 § Government legislation has made ecological structural change 
inevitable. Electrification has the potential to transform mobility 
and makes compliance with carbon emission regulations possible. 
However, this profound change presents new challenges for exist-
ing production methods and requires retraining for employees.  
At the same time, the shift toward electric mobility and the 
associated investments in production capacity, like for the man-
ufacturing of innovative battery technology, also generate new 
employment opportunities.
 § But electric mobility also raises new environmental questions, 
such as how to measure the environmental impact of electric and 
hybrid vehicles compared with conventional vehicles in terms  
of the use of mineral resources in production and the recycling of 
battery cells at the end of the product lifecycle.
 § Automated vehicles and new mobility services offer more con-
venience, boost safety, and encourage further optimization of 
transport and traffic systems, especially in urban agglomerations. 
The lines between individual and collective mobility are becoming 
increasingly blurred. The result is a new competitive environment 
with completely new players, to which the Volkswagen Group 
must adapt.
Identifying, openly addressing and finding solutions to these issues –  
in collaboration with our stakeholders whenever possible, but at 
the very least in a spirit of constructive dialog – is essential to the 
Volkswagen Group’s sustainable growth. Whenever we fail to achieve 
a balance between economic, social and environmental objectives, 
long-term risks emerge both for our stakeholders and for the financial 
success of the Volkswagen Group.

AND SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT

Even if the major challenges are known and can be assessed,  
the resulting demands on the Volkswagen Group are nevertheless 
subject to constant change and must be reassessed at regular 
intervals, necessitating ongoing adjustments to our strategic plan-
ning. Consequently, within the Volkswagen Group we have several 
specialized functions engaged in observing megatrends in society, 
analyzing the overall economic environment, tracking emerging 
customer trends and continuously benchmarking our products and 
services against the competition. The results are brought together 
in a process known as the planning round, which ensures that the 
important decisions for production, purchasing and sales structures 
are made on the basis of a ten-year timeline. Another instrument 
for identifying challenges and expectations and for dealing with 
changing underlying conditions is the stakeholder dialog, which we 
cultivate at both Group and market level (see “Stakeholder Manage-
ment”).
Based on these observations and in light of the widespread societal 
challenges we face, in 2016 we once again reviewed the identified 
areas in which the Volkswagen Group can and must make a special 
contribution – because these are fields where we have a significant 
impact or where we are particularly well placed to exert influence, 
and where consequently a great deal is also expected of us.

In 2016, two developments played a role in a detailed analysis of the  
topics of material importance to the Volkswagen Group. Specifically,  
these were the question of the strategic realignment of the Company  
under our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, and the question of handling 
the repercussions from the diesel crisis.
In practice, our approach to the analysis and identification of signifi-
cant issues was as follows:
1.  From global challenges, we derived a list of 16 central action areas 
in which we need to provide answers. We did this on the basis of 
the following sources: external studies, industry analyses and our 
brands’ stakeholder surveys, as well as internal guidelines such 
as the Group-wide TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 and the individual 
strategies of our divisions.
2.  The identification of these action areas was largely based on the 
findings of three expert workshops held in 2015, addressing topics 
relating to the economy, the environment and people. One key 
objective was to develop targets and indicators for issues deemed 
significant. The findings were incorporated into the corporate 
restructuring which followed as part of the TOGETHER – Strategy 
2025, enabling a systematic examination of non-financial perfor-
mance indicators.
3.  Since the creation of the Volkswagen Group’s Corporate Strategy 
unit in November 2015, information and ideas are shared more 
closely and intensively between the sustainability and strategy 
teams. This has included, for example, participation in the Corpo-
rate Sustainability Steering Committee and in strategy workshops.
4.  To ensure that sustainability is implemented as part of the 
corporate strategy, four workshops were held with sustainability 
officers from the brands and specialist departments in the first 
half of 2016. One important result was a clear focus in the topic  
of decarbonization. This led us to revisit the “climate protection/ 
decarbonization” action area, which was then included in 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 with an indicator (decarbonization 
index). In addition, activities bundled under “environment and 
nature conservation” were made more visible in that action area.
5.  Whereas – in light of the diesel issue – at the 2015 Group CSR 
Meeting (GCM) we held discussions with representatives of the 
brands and regions, examining the Group’s sustainability perfor-
mance based on an analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, at 
the 2016 GCM we focused completely on TOGETHER – Strategy 
2025. This included discussing the significance of the United Na-
tions’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the Volkswagen 
Group and conducting an assessment. The results were explored

in depth by the various sustainability committees and have been 
integrated into the Group’s comprehensive realignment process.
6.  Following these detailed discussions, the overall findings of the  
materiality process led to the realization that in view of the 
Group’s size, its potential influence and the associated responsi-
This representation of the 16 key action areas, broken down into the 
three dimensions of Economy, People and Environment, is intended 
to illustrate the factors we focus on in order to be a leading global 
provider of sustainable mobility. In view of our broad international 
standing, we have deliberately avoided any prioritization of our 
action areas. On the one hand, the relevance of the individual areas 
may vary by region; on the other hand, we do not want to judge,  
bility, all the issues on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) list of 
sustainability aspects can and must be regarded as “significant” 
for the Volkswagen Group. The specific measures within the action 
areas are still being fleshed out in line with the objectives, values 
and indicators in our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025.

Sustainable management 
The Volkswagen Group has made a commitment to sustainability-oriented, transparent and responsible management. 
The greatest challenge to putting this into practice at all levels and all stages of the value chain is our complexity, with 
12 brands, more than 625,000 employees and 120 production sites. In line with the recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code, we practice Group-wide sustainability coordination and forward-looking risk manage-
ment, and rely on a clear framework for the future-oriented handling of environmental issues, responsibility toward our 
employees and social engagement by our brands and in the various regions. The remuneration of the Group Board of 
Management is geared to the Company’s long-term results.

Our internal sustainability coordination reflects the inseparability 
of our corporate and sustainability strategies. We firmly believe that 
a company can only be successful in the long term if its corporate 
activities remain in balance with the environment and society. This 
is why at Volkswagen, sustainability is a management issue. In its 
function as our Sustainability Board, in 2016, the Group Board of 
Management under the leadership of CEO Matthias Müller regularly 
worked on strategic questions of holistic sustainability manage-
ment, encompassing issues of environmental as well as social 
responsibility.
The Group Board of Management is regularly informed by the 
Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee on issues related to 
sustainability and corporate responsibility. The steering commit-

tee includes top managers from central Group business areas and 
representatives of the Group Works Council and the brands. Its tasks 
include defining strategic sustainability goals and position state-
ments, identifying key action areas, and approving the sustainability 
report. Indicators are used to monitor the extent to which these 
sustainability goals are being met. The steering committee meets 
regularly under the leadership of the external affairs and sustain-
ability function.
The sustainability office supports the steering committee. Its duties 
include coordinating all sustainability-related activities within the 
Group and the brands. Relevant economic, environmental and social 
issues are integrated into the ongoing development of the Group’s 
sustainability strategy. As part of the environmental and socio- 
political regulatory process, we maintain on ongoing dialog with 
policymakers with the aim of providing information and advice and 
learning from each other. Stakeholder expectations from the brands 
and regions are comprehensively discussed in the sustainability 
office. The office also handles the monitoring and coordination of 
sustainability ratings, the results of which increasingly impact on 
companies’ attractiveness to investors. And finally, it is responsible 
for drawing up the sustainability report and coordinating the Sus-
tainability Council and its meetings.
At divisional level, the CSR project team fosters a regular exchange  
of information on current projects between the various sustainability  
experts within the Volkswagen Group. In addition, other project 
teams work across business areas on topics such as reporting,  
stakeholder management and sustainability in supplier relations. 
These coordination and working structures have also been estab-
lished across the brands and are subject to ongoing development. 
With the aim of continuously improving our sustainability concept 
and living up to the expectations of our stakeholders, the Volkswagen 
Group has set up two external committees, the Sustainability  
Council and the Stakeholder Panel, to independently advise the 
Group. 
Appointed in 2016, the international Sustainability Council is made 
up of renowned experts from the scientific community, government 
and society. Council members regularly consult with the Board of 
Management, senior managers and employee representatives. The 
council’s role is to keep a watchful, critical eye on developments 
within the Company and in society. The Sustainability Council is 
authorized to proactively propose topics and implement projects 
subject to prior agreement. More detailed information on the coun-
cil’s members and activities can be found here.
In cooperation with the Institute for Market, Environment and Society 
(imug), we set up a Stakeholder Panel that has kept track of our 
sustainability activities, especially those covered in our sustainability 
reporting, for the past 20 years and provided a critical commentary. 
The panel includes some 100 national and international stakeholders 
from government, academia and research, the financial markets, 
and civil society. Detailed interviews are conducted and the findings 
applied to sharpen our understanding of the expectations of our ex-
ternal stakeholders. This helps us ask the necessary critical questions 
and systematically optimize our sustainability management and 
reporting to make them more effective.
FUNCTIONS AND COMPOSITION OF  
THE MANAGEMENT BODIES
The Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, which is has nine 
members, is the ultimate body responsible for managing the Group. 
Each member is responsible for one or more functions, and some 
members also have responsibility for a region. The Group Board of  
Management is supported in its work by the boards and manage-
ment teams of the brands and regions, and of the other Group 
companies and affiliated companies. The Supervisory Board, which 
appoints, monitors and advises the Board of Management, is con-
sulted directly on decisions that are of material significance for the 
Company. The composition of the Supervisory Board complies with 
the Gesetz für die gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Män-
nern an Führungspositionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentli-
chen Dienst (FührposGleichberG – Act on the Equal Participation  
of Women and Men in leadership Positions in the Private and Public 
Sectors), which specifies a statutory quota of at least 30% women 
and at least 30% men. Shareholder and employee representatives 
have resolved that each side shall meet this quota separately.

GUIDELINES AND PRINCIPLES
Our business practices are in line with the recommendations of the 
German Corporate Governance Code, and we coordinate sustainability 
across the Group. This reflects our conviction that stable, long-term 
business based on ethical criteria is a prerequisite for acting in an 
environment-friendly way and playing a responsible part in shaping 
the future of people within the Group and in society at large. 
Voluntary undertakings and principles that apply across the Group 
form the basis and backbone of our sustainability management. 
These include our Model of Sustainable Development, our stake-
holder guidelines and our corporate guidelines. 
Model of Sustainable Development:
The Model of Sustainable Development, which Volkswagen adopted 
in 2002 to mark the UN World Summit in South Africa, build a bridge 
between our traditions and our future while providing a framework 
for sustainable corporate policy with three key elements:
 § a lasting balance between economic, ecological and social  
systems and the aim for a long-term balance of divergent interests,
 § responsibility for our own actions at regional, national and  
global level,
 § transparent communications and fair cooperation.
Stakeholder Guidelines
In addition, we are committed to the United Nations Global Com-
pact, and since 2002 have remained dedicated to promoting human 
rights, upholding labor standards, protecting the environment and 
combatting corruption. In 2013, this commitment was extended to 
include the CEO Water Mandate, which aims to ensure careful use 
of water resources. Until the diesel crisis has finally been resolved, 
we have agreed that the Volkswagen Group’s membership should be 
suspended.

As an automobile manufacturer encompassing 12 brands and 120 production sites in 153 markets, we are confronted 
with a broad spectrum of requirements, expectations and attitudes on a daily basis. The enormous diversity of our 
interactions represents an enormous opportunity, because the relationships which our companies maintain with their 
stakeholders are invaluable to the work we do together. At the same time, this diversity of interests is also a challenge, 
because it can result in conflicting objectives.

Volkswagen Group Stakeholders 
In the 2016 reporting year, our stakeholders took advantage of sur-
veys and dialog events to communicate numerous expectations of 
the Volkswagen Group. We have summarized their suggestions and 
feedback, as well as our reactions to this input, for you here.

G4-21, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27
We have a strategic stakeholder management system in place to 
help the Volkswagen Group navigate the large numbers of diverse 
stakeholders and their needs, and ensure they are included in our 
business decisions. We will only be successful in the long term if 
we familiarize ourselves thoroughly with the interests, needs and 
expectations of our stakeholders and deal with them proactively.  
To successfully facilitate a dialog of equals, our stakeholder manage-
ment system must meet the following criteria:
 § Systematically recording the expectations placed on Volkswagen
 § Productively sharing the knowledge of all parties involved
 § jointly developing solutions to problems
 § Transparently making decisions
We believe that stakeholder management means fostering relation-
ships with our stakeholders. This requires systematic and strategic 
planning, implementation and monitoring of our activities. To this 
end, in the 2016 reporting year we restructured and consolidated 
our stakeholder management system in line with a holistic approach.

Stakeholder Management at Volkswagen
§ Planning and Governance: Our brands and divisions are responsi-
ble for maintaining direct contact with our stakeholders. We bring 
these processes together under one roof at Group level, ensuring 
that information is shared between Group, brands and regions, 
establishing clear guidelines for stakeholder management, and 
coordinating the activities of Group sustainability officers (sus-
tainability management). 
§ Documentation and Communication: Our Sustainability Report is 
our primary medium for documentation. Shift, our sustainability 
magazine, supplements this report with critical self-scrutiny and 
forward-looking perspectives. We regularly provide additional 
information on current projects in press releases and social media. 
For internal communications, we also use our online community 
Group Connect, several magazines and a short messaging service. 
We employ the latter to send out weekly information on current 
topics and issues in two languages. The Group Sustainability 
Council has its own newsletter. 
§ Standardization: Our stakeholder management is guided by the 
standards established by many different levels of regulation 
(policies). The most important policies include the AccountAbility 
1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard and the latest genera-
tion of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). We also 
remain committed to the objectives and principles of sustainable 
development. 
§ Consultation: An overview of our programs and initiatives for 
dialog and interaction can be found here. In the reporting year, the 
primary forums for direct, face-to-face discussions were the Audi 
Stakeholder Forum in Brussels, the Scania Sustainable Transport 
Forum in Paris, and the Stakeholder Panel dialog event held by 
Volkswagen AG in Hanover. Information received from NGOs, such  
as a recent study conducted by terre des hommes that made us 
aware of issues surrounding the production of mica in India, can 
also lead us to initiate discussions and examine opportunities for 
cooperation.
§ Partnerships: At the Group level, our work with selected stake-
holders takes the form of strategic partnerships. In the reporting 
year, this included our cooperation with the German Red Cross 
(DRK) and Kiron. Since 1998, the Volkswagen Group Works Council 
has been successfully collaborating with terre des hommes, a 
children’s and young people’s charity, in the “One hour for the 
future” campaign. Our memberships provide an additional format 
for cooperation with our stakeholders. A list of our current mem-
berships can be found here.
§ Participation: Stakeholder relations are not a one-way street. We
see our stakeholders as equal partners, and involve them in our 
decision-making processes. In addition to the strong culture of co-
determination at Volkswagen, which played a role in the 
 development of our Social Charter and Charter on labour Relations, 
the activities of our Group Sustainability Council should also be 
mentioned.
§ Evaluation: Stakeholder management begins with the question of 
stakeholder needs and ends with systematic monitoring of results. 
Each year, we collect feedback from our stakeholders through our 
Stakeholder Panel and our comprehensive stakeholder surveys. 
The results of our 2016 reputation study, which we used to obtain 
a systematic picture of the opinions and expectations of our
stakeholders, can be found here. In addition, three dissertation
projects are currently examining suggestions for the further devel-
opment of our stakeholder management approach.
“Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 
development” is one of the United Nation’s goals 
for sustainable development.

STrATEGY     CORPORATE CITIzENSHIP 
Corporate Citizenship 
Volkswagen has always believed in the importance of assuming 
social responsibility for our stakeholders. As an internationally active 
corporation, we bear a global responsibility that extends beyond our 
factory gates. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined 
by the United Nations in 2015 will provide an important frame of 
reference for our corporate citizenship going forward. One of the 
objectives behind the revision of our corporate citizenship strategy 
in 2016 was to identify those SDGs to which the Volkswagen Group 
can contribute most effectively. 
We consider it important to take a strategic approach to corporate 
citizenship, so we select and develop our projects carefully – both 
independently and in collaboration with local partner organizations 
and NGOs. Alongside our objective of helping to address global chal-
lenges, the needs of local stakeholders play an equally important 
role for us. local project management allows us to react flexibly to 
these needs. To achieve the aim of lasting structural change, we also 
place great value on continuity and long-term partnerships. 
In selecting and implementing projects, we are guided by our Group-
wide policies, which provide the decision-making framework for all 
our activities:
 § The projects align with our corporate mission while addressing a 
global challenge or a specific local or regional issue. 
 § They are an expression of the diversity within the Group and the 
social environment in which the projects are being carried out. 
 § They are developed in close dialog with local stakeholders, who 
are also involved in their implementation. 
 § Projects are managed locally under the responsibility of the units 
that operate in that region. 
By turning our attention to both local and international issues, 
we are able to live up to the many and diverse expectations of our 
stakeholders. In 2016, the Group and all its brands and regions were 
involved in around 200 projects, which included development, edu-
cational and social welfare initiatives.
STRATEGIC CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
The building blocks of our corporate citizenship initiatives are de cen-
tralized project management, diversity, and space for local needs. 
Nevertheless, in the future we intend to pursue the networking of 
projects at Group level more aggressively, which will allow us to 
scale up successful projects and bundle resources even more effi-
ciently. We also want to obtain a more comprehensive overview of 
the effectiveness of our projects. With this in mind, we are looking 
at new ways to quantify our activities. Building on the london 
Benchmarking Group input-output-impact (IOI) method for mea-
suring the effectiveness of corporate citizenship initiatives, we have 
analyzed selected projects to find out who they benefit. As part of 
this process, we have also aggregated our inputs across the Group 
and recorded the different objectives in detail. 
This extensive pool of data gives us a comprehensive overview of the 
backgrounds, objectives and effectiveness of our environmental and 
community projects. Based on this information, we will revise our 
corporate citizenship strategy in 2017 and define new areas of focus 
in line with our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025. We will also, however, 
continue to prioritize a balance between large-scale transregional  
projects that address strategically important issues, and local 
projects that take local problems and stakeholder expectations into 
account. 
A description of our organizational structure and the guidelines 
associated with our management approach to Corporate Social 
Responsibility can be found at Chapter People > Competent and  
dedicated employees > Commitment to Society.
Worldwide Responsibility
Through some 200 projects around the globe, the Volkswagen Group 
is making a contribution to social mobility in the fields of education, 
diversity and health while at the same time promoting road safety, 
regional economic development, sports, and the arts. These projects 
can take on countless forms in order to meet different local needs 
and challenges. In India, our T5 was repurposed as a mobile health 
clinic in very short order; in Uitenhage, South Africa, we are helping 
young entrepreneurs to launch start-ups; and in China, we are 
running seminars and campaigns to raise awareness of child safety 
on roads. An overview of our many, varied projects, together with 
detailed descriptions of each project, can be found here.

STrATEGY     RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with  
our operating activities and taking a forward-looking approach  
to managing them is crucial to our Company’s long-term success.  
A comprehensive risk management and internal control system 
(RMS/ICS) helps the Volkswagen Group deal with risks in a responsible 
manner.
The aim of RMS/ICS is to identify potential risks at an early stage so 
that suitable countermeasures can be taken to avert the threat of 
loss to the Company, and so that any risks that might jeopardize its 
continued existence can be ruled out.
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS 
is based on the internationally recognized COSO framework for 
enterprise risk management (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission). In the reporting year, 
Volkswagen again pursued a holistic, integrated approach that 
combines a risk management system, an internal control system 
and a compliance management system (CMS) within a single man-
agement strategy. Uniform Group principles are used as the basis for 
managing risks in a consistent manner.
In the reporting year, we continued to develop our RMS/ICS. In 
addition to the ad hoc and annual risk assessment, the Board of 
Management also receives quarterly risk reports. This additional  
reporting on the current risk situation raises awareness of risks in 
the Company and encourages an open approach to dealing with 
them. We continued to reinforce the internal control system in the 
area of product compliance in 2016. This includes what are known 
as the Golden Rules, which we describe in the chapter on the diesel 
issue in the Volkswagen AG 2016 Annual Report, pages 96 and 97.
Assessing the probability and extent of future events and develop-
ments is, by its nature, subject to uncertainty. We are therefore 
aware that even the best RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and 
even the best ICS can never completely prevent illicit actions.
“THREE LINES OF DEFENSE” APPROACH
Another key element of the RMS/ICS at Volkswagen is the three lines 
of defense model, a basic element required, among others, by the 
European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). 
In line with this model, the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS has three 
lines of defense that are designed to protect the Company from the 
occurrence of significant risks.
 § The first line of defense is formed by the divisions, companies 
and brands. Events that may give rise to risks are identified and 
assessed locally in the divisions and by the investees. Thanks  
to reports during the year via the paths documented above, the 
Board has an overall picture of the current risk situation at all 
times. The minimum requirements for the RMS/ICS are laid down 
in a single guidance document for the entire Group. This also 
includes a process for timely notification of significant risks.
 § The second line of defense is the Group Governance, Risk &  
Compliance (GRC) department, which sets standards for the  
RMS/ICS and coordinates the quarterly risk survey and the annual 
GRC control process. In the GRC control process, the brands, major 
companies and individual functions identify systemic risks and 
verify the effectiveness of the RMS/ICS. This serves as a basis  
for updating the overall picture of the potential risk situation and 
assessing the effectiveness of the system. The Group Board of 
Management receives a report on significant risks, which are also 
defined in terms of quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria 
and given probability ratings. 
 § The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which makes 
regular checks on the structure and implementation of the RMS as 
part of its independent audit activities
A detailed overview of our risk management and internal control 
system can be found in the Report on Risks and Opportunities in the 
Group Management Report of our 2016 Annual Report.

SIGNIFICANT RISKS 
The diesel issue both causes risks for the Volkswagen Group and has  
an impact on existing risks. The Volkswagen Group has made suit-
able provisions for risks arising from the diesel issue, in particular 
for the upcoming service campaigns, recalls and customer-related 
measures, as well as legal risks, but also for residual value risks.
Risks that could impact on the Volkswagen Group’s bottom line also 
include general environmental risks and climate change risks. These 
risks are identified, assessed and managed by the Group’s divisions 
and companies within the framework of the RMS. This includes risks 
which can result from CO2 and emissions legislation and regulations. 
Extreme weather situations, storms or floods can lead to failure of 
information and communication technology, supplier failure result-
ing in production stoppages, or general production downtime at one 
of our more than 100 production locations worldwide.
More information on economic, political, financial and operational 
risks can be found in the Report on Risks and Opportunities in the 
Group Management Report of our 2016 Annual Report.

Diesel Crisis. 
A Status Report
TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Volkswagen does not tolerate any breaches of the law or other wrong-
doing. We deeply regret the behavior that gave rise to the diesel cri-
sis. Such misconduct runs contrary to all the values that Volkswagen  
stands for. We have taken significant steps to strengthen account-
ability, extend transparency and prevent something like this from ever 
happening again.
Chronicle 
The trust of our customers, our shareholders, partners, employees 
and the general public is our most important asset. The Group has 
substantially elevated its commitment to working ethically and with 
integrity. Volkswagen can and will set an example in the years ahead 
as to how a large, global company embodies and takes its social 
responsibility seriously.

STrATEGY     DIESEl CRISIS. A STATUS REPORT
IMPACT
Operating result for 2016: Special items recognized in operating 
profit relating to the diesel issue amounted to €–6.4 billion in fiscal 
year 2016, mainly due to higher provisions for legal risks.
Legal risks: Various legal risks are associated with the diesel issue. 
The provisions recognized for this matter and the contingent lia-
bilities disclosed as well as the other latent legal risks are partially 
subject to substantial estimation risks given the complexity of the 
individual factors, the ongoing approval process with the authorities 
and the fact that the independent, comprehensive investigations 
have not yet been completed. The legal risks include (detailed infor-
mation can be found in the chapter on “litigation”:
CLARIFYING THE FACTS
In january 2017, Volkswagen AG agreed with the US government to 
resolve federal criminal liability relating to the diesel issue. The Volk-
swagen Group also agreed with the US government to resolve civil 
penalties and injunctive relief under the Clean Air Act and other civil 
claims against the Company relating to the diesel issue.
The coordinated resolutions involve four settlements, including a plea 
agreement between Volkswagen AG and the DOj. The plea agreement 
is accompanied by a published Statement of Facts that lays out rele-
vant facts and has been acknowledged by Volkswagen AG.
As part of its plea agreement, Volkswagen AG has agreed to plead 
guilty to three felony counts under US law: conspiracy, obstruction 
of justice and using false statements to import cars into the US. 
The plea agreement, which is subject to US federal court approval, 
provides for payment of a criminal fine of $2.8 billion and the 
appointment of an independent monitor for a period of three years. 
The independent monitor will assess and oversee the Company’s 
compliance with the terms of the resolution. This includes oversee-
ing the implementation of measures to further strengthen compli-
ance, reporting and monitoring systems, and an enhanced ethics 
program.
Organizing the Clarification
Volkswagen AG commissioned an external investigation by US law 
firm jones Day. This is an independent and comprehensive investiga-
tion into the diesel issue. jones Day is updating the Company and 
the Department of justice (DOj) on the current results of its investiga-
tion on an ongoing basis and assisting Volkswagen AG in its cooper-
ation with the judicial authorities. The course of action in clearing up 
the situation was determined largely by the investigating authorities.
Furthermore, Volkswagen AG filed a criminal complaint in September 
2015 with the responsible public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig, 
 § Criminal and administrative proceedings worldwide (excluding 
the USA/Canada)
 § Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada)
 § lawsuits filed by investors worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada)
 § Proceedings in the USA/Canada.
Should these legal risks materialize, this could result in considerable 
financial charges. Further risks from the diesel issue can be found in 
the Report on Risks and Opportunities.
which is independently investigating the matter, including allegations 
of fraud. Searches were carried out in Wolfsburg and elsewhere with 
the involvement of special agents from the State Office of Criminal 
Investigation.
We are cooperating with all the responsible authorities to clarify 
these matters completely and transparently.
Investigations were divided into two parts. The Group Internal Audit 
function, which involved bringing together experts from various 
Group companies to form a task force, focused – as instructed by 
the Supervisory Board and Board of Management – on reviewing 
relevant processes, reporting and control systems as well as the 
accompanying infrastructure. This function paid special attention 
to the processes of software development for the engine control 
unit. The Group Internal Audit function provided its findings to the 
external experts from jones Day. The internationally renowned law 
firm was engaged by Volkswagen AG to fully clarify the facts and 
responsibilities in a second investigation. jones Day has received 
operational support from auditing firm Deloitte.
The special investigation has involved conducting interviews with 
employees and managers who were identified by jones as relevant 
sources of information on the diesel issue. In addition, jones Day has 
evaluated documents and data (such as emails).
Communicating the Results of the Investigation
As already stated in April 2016, the US lawyers mandated by Volk-
swagen had strongly advised against publication of interim results 
at that time. They had a number of reasons for making this recom-
mendation. Among other things, publication could have impaired 
the ongoing investigation and had a significant negative impact on 
the cooperation between Volkswagen and the DOj. 
How long will it take until the company is able to leave the diesel crisis behind it?
“I can’t give you an exact time period – but it will take us quite a while. Serious mistakes  
were made at Volkswagen. We have already paid dearly for them, and we remain  
committed to taking responsibility for our actions. At the same time, we are using the crisis as  
a starting point from which to steer Volkswagen in the right direction.”   
Hans Dieter pötsch, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in an interview.

STrATEGY     DIESEl CRISIS. A STATUS REPORT
ACTIONS
Monitor 
The plea agreement provides for payment of a criminal fine of 
$2.8 billion and the appointment of an independent monitor for the 
next three years. The independent monitor will assess and oversee 
Volkswagen’s compliance with the terms of the resolution. These 
conditions include measures for further strengthening compliance 
and the reporting and control systems at Volkswagen, as well as 
implementing an enhanced ethics program.
Volkswagen has agreed to this solution and intends to comply with 
the terms of each of the agreements reached.
As part of the sought-for consent decree, Volkswagen has agreed to 
report on the steps it will take to further develop the processes that 
will enable the Group to manage the ethical behavior of employees, 
research and development, quality assurance and compliance with  
US environmental legislation.
Optimizing Processes
The initiatives implemented in response to the diesel crisis aim to 
further strengthen operational processes as well as reporting and 
control systems, in order to ensure that responsibilities are clearly 
and unequivocally regulated at all times. In addition, a more robust 
whistleblower system and new, stricter standards for performing 
in-house emission tests have been established. The Group has 
significantly expanded its voluntary commitment to act ethically 
and with integrity, and forged ahead with decentralization within 
the organization. Brands and regions can now run their business 
operations much more autonomously. These and other initiatives are 
part of a comprehensive transformation of Volkswagen’s corporate 
culture into a more entrepreneurial, international organization.
Within the Volkswagen Group, emissions tests are now always 
audited by independent third parties. In addition, “real-life” tests of 
emission characteristics under real-world driving conditions are now 
carried out internally. In tests of this kind, before a model is given 
technical approval, a deliberate search is made for anything that 
indicates the possible use of a defeat device. Important: in each case, 
these tests must be carried out by a different department, which is/
was not responsible for developing the vehicle model to be tested.
Volkswagen has not only optimized its technical processes, but also 
improved its general compliance organization.
Specific corrective action was proposed by Group Internal Audit for 
the weaknesses it identified in 2015.
As part of a structured follow-up process, implementation of cor-
rective actions in 2016 was continuously tracked and reported to 
the relevant bodies. A total of 31 measures were de-fined by Group 
Internal Audit and the majority of them were implemented by the 
end of 2016. The plan is to implement the remaining measures by 
the middle of 2017.
While the procedural investigations of Group Internal Audit primarily 
applied to processes associated with diesel technology in 2015,  
the findings resulting from the investigations in the reporting period 
were transformed into general guidelines to shore up governance 
and compliance. The “Golden Rules” encourage greater attentive-
ness and increase acceptance of critical process steps. These rules 
represent minimum requirements in multiple categories, including 
the organization, process and tools & systems categories of control 
unit software development, emission classification and escalation 
management.
Self-assessments were performed in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
Audi and Porsche brands to ensure structured application of the 
Golden Rules and thus to optimize the internal control system (ICS) 
in the areas affected. The results were validated as an integral part 
of an investigation by the audit departments in the relevant brands 
or by Group Internal Audit. By applying this consistent methodology 
across the brands, the implementation status of the guidelines in the 
Golden Rules was established and transparency created regarding 
the degree of maturity of the ICS for the relevant processes; also for 
the Board of Management.
In addition, a cross-brand project that ensures similar implementa-
tion of the Golden Rules while taking the individual features of the 
brands into account was initiated under the responsibility of Group 
Research and Development. As part of this, development depart-
ments within the group reviewed their processes. Representatives 
of the brands are working on the optimization of their processes in 
project groups.
Key elements of the process optimization are:
 § Early identification and interpretation of legislation around the 
world and alignment of the product portfolio with the legal 
requirements
 § Guidelines for the development of software for drive control units 
with documentation of the features of relevance to registration
 § Introduction of multiple controls for approvals in the product 
development process
 § Reorganization within development for the purpose of separat-
ing the responsibility for the development of drives from official 
approvals
 § Formation of new bodies for cross-brand management and clarifi-
cation of compliance issues
 § Uniform process standards and work instructions that give those 
involved legal certainty in the work process
 § Training programs in which everyone involved in the process is 
required to participate

Integrity Program
On january 1, 2016, we started to create the organizational frame-
work for a centralized integrity management function by setting up 
the new Board of Management position for Integrity and legal Af-
fairs. This Group function is responsible for planning, preparing and 
implementing programs and projects aimed at raising, clarifying and 
intensifying a collective awareness of integrity, as well as reinforcing 
a shared culture of integrity in the Company. A continuous exchange 
of ideas and discussion of issues relating to integrity are key compo-
nents of the integrity management function.
Volkswagen’s goal is to enhance the culture of integrity in the Com-
pany and create a collective awareness of integrity. To this end, we 
launched an integrity program in 2016 involving all employees that 
is based on six action areas:
1.  Dialog & communication: We provided information at regular 
intervals on the concept of integrity and its importance as well as 
on the evolution of the integrity program. In addition, we set up 
an integrity mailbox to create opportunities for direct communica-
tion between the integrity management team and the workforce. 
An exchange in the form of a live chat also took place on the 
GroupConnect internal social network.
2.  Sounding Board program: A shared understanding of what integ-
rity means at Volkswagen can only be developed with the involve-
ment and the experience of the entire workforce. This is why we 
have instituted the Sounding Board program as a key initiative in 
the integrity program. It will ensure close collaboration and dialog 
between the integrity management team and the workforce with 
the help of integrity ambassadors – voluntary support staff from 
management and staff circles. Interactive services forming part of 
this program round off the communications portfolio.
3.  Executive program: Management’s function as a role model for 
integrity along with managers’ special responsibility was clearly 
illustrated in a letter signed by all members of the Group Board 
of Management and in supplementary information circulated to 
executives and managers. The topic of integrity was also a fixed 
part of numerous management events.
4.  Processes & tools: We are continuously examining the possibility 
of incorporating our principles of integrity into the Company’s 
key management elements, for example in the field of human 
resources and collaboration with business partners
5.  Monitoring & reporting: Regular monitoring of the integrity 
program not only helps us to fine-tune and readjust; it also 
underlines the relevance of the concept of integrity for employees 
and managers. Here, continuous evaluation of feedback from 
the integrity ambassadors and from employees and managers 
on issues relating to the adaptation and ref-inement of concepts 
plays just as important a role as the reporting in internal media 
and publications such as the sustainability report.
6.  Internationalization: Once the pilot phase at the Wolfsburg site 
has ended, we intend to expand the integrity program to all 
brands, companies and regions. Managers of our Governance and

Responsibly along the  
entire value chain
Management approach
In the future, technological innovations will allow us to meet the mobility needs of business and society, conserving 
resources through significant advances in efficiency and economy.
The automotive world is undergoing a period of revolutionary 
change, and autonomous driving, e-mobility, connected vehicle con-
cepts and the dynamics of digital transformation are showing the 
new way forward. Technological innovations are exerting huge in-
fluence on customer expectations and established business models, 
new players are entering the market, shorter innovation cycles are 
the norm, and the development of new core competencies requires 
steadily increasing capital investment. Combined with ever more 
stringent emissions standards and a highly volatile market, all these 
factors are creating ever more demanding market conditions. This 
presents us, as an automotive manufacturer, with new challenges –  
but also with a whole range of new opportunities, including pros-
pects for lasting growth. Our aim is to operate responsibly along 
the entire value chain. Everyone should benefit from this – our 
customers, our employees, the environment and society as a whole. 
We intend to become one of the world’s leading providers of sus-
tainable mobility, creating enduring values, offering good working 
conditions, and treating the environment and natural resources 
with due care.
The early identification of pioneering developments and trends in 
the ever more complex fields of social, political, technological, envi-
ronmental and economic activity represents an important basis  
for innovation and thus for the success of our business. This aware-
ness of current and future trends is crucially important for the 
correct orientation of our research and development activities. Only 
if we are armed with a reliable vision of technical possibilities  
and at the same time, of their limitations, can we position the 
Group in such a way as to ensure sustainable growth. This is why the 
Volkswagen Group’s research institutions scattered throughout the 
world’s key automotive markets monitor pioneering developments 
directly at the coal face, thereby gaining crucial insights that will help 
safeguard the Group’s future.
In the reporting period, we focused our research activities on 
devising new mobility solutions, as well as developing expertise in 
technological innovation that will make us even more competitive. 
Our development activities focused on expanding our product range 
and enhancing the functionality, quality, safety and environmental 
compatibility of our products. 
Our company’s long-term success also depends on how promptly  
we identify risks and opportunities, and how systematically we com-
ply with laws, regulations, ethical principles and our own voluntary 
commitments. Thus prudent risk management, effective internal 
monitoring systems and a stringent compliance organization are of 
enormous importance to us. Not only do we set high standards with-
in the Volkswagen Group, we also insist that all our suppliers along 
our entire value chain comply with these standards.

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2016, the pace of global economic growth was slightly slower 
than in the previous year. By contrast, global demand for vehicles 
was higher. Despite persistently difficult market conditions, the 
Volkswagen Group delivered more than 10 million vehicles to 
customers. In the reporting period, we launched a large number of 
attractive new models on the market, some of which were based  
on the Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB). The current product port-
folio comprises 336 models, covering almost all key segments and 
body types, ranging from subcompact cars to supercars in the pas-
senger car segment, from pickups to heavy trucks and buses in the 
commercial vehicles segment, plus motorcycles. By taking account  
of regional market and customer needs, we have systematically 
geared our product portfolio to profitable growth. 
GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PASSENGER CARS HITS  
NEW RECORD HIGH
In fiscal year 2016, the number of new passenger car registrations 
rose to 81.1 million vehicles worldwide, exceeding the previous 
year’s record by 5.4%. Demand was up in the Asia-Pacific, Western 
Europe, North America and Central Europe regions, while new pas-
senger car registrations in South America, Eastern Europe and Africa 
failed to match the previous year’s levels.
We expect trends in the various regional passenger car markets to 
vary considerably in 2017. Overall, growth in global demand for new 
vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period.
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
development of automotive markets around the world. Our broad, 
selectively expanded product range features the latest generation  
of engines as well as a variety of alternative drive technologies, put-
ting us in a good position compared with our competitors.
Our goal is to offer all customers the mobility and innovations they 
need, strengthening our long-term market position in the process. 
Our policy of adding maximum value at local level is a vital part of 
this approach – and with good reason. Not only does it allow us to 
reap numerous economic benefits, it also minimizes our risk expo-
sure. In each case, we are an important local driver of growth, while 
at the same time being in a better position to accommodate our 
customers’ wishes. 
SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT
Sector-specific conditions were significantly influenced by fiscal pol-
icy measures, which made a substantial contribution to the mixed 
trends in sales volumes in the various target markets during the 2015 
financial year. The instruments used for this were tax reductions or 
increases, incentive programs and sales incentives, as well as import 
duties.
Non-tariff trade barriers designed to protect various countries’ do-
mestic automotive industries made the free movement of vehicles, 
parts and components more difficult. Protectionist tendencies were 
especially evident where markets were on the decline.
This is contributing to increased volatility in the global procurement 
and sales markets. In response to this changing environment, we 
intend to focus more strongly on high-growth segments and regions –  
such as the economy segment in China and India. In particular, as 
we continue to transform our core business, we will differentiate the 
positioning of our Group brands more precisely and further optimize 
our vehicle and powertrain portfolio as we target the most attractive, 
fastest growing market segments. We will unveil more SUV models, 
integrate digitalization more systematically into our products and pro-
vide important stimuli for the future through our e-mobility offerings.

ECoNoMY    MANAGEMENT APPROACH
QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The quality of our products and services plays a key role in main-
taining customer satisfaction. Customers are particularly satisfied 
and remain loyal when their expectations of a product or service are 
met or even exceeded. Throughout the product experience, appeal, 
reliability and service are what determine quality as perceived by 
the customer. Our objective is to positively surprise and excite our 
customers in all areas and thus win them over with our outstanding 
quality. We continued to aspire to this objective in the reporting peri-
od. The diesel issue has shown, however, that we must broaden our 
previous understanding of quality. Quality assurance now checks the 
compliance of our products even more intensively.
We are also placing greater emphasis on our quality management 
system than before, thereby reinforcing the process-driven approach 
across all our business activities Group-wide. Quality management 
in the Volkswagen Group is based on the ISO 9001 standard: we 
must comply with the provisions of this standard to obtain type ap-
proval for producing and selling our vehicles. Following the revision 
of the standard in 2015, we applied the new requirements to all 
the Group’s locations and brands during the reporting period. One 
key change in the standard concerns the assessment of risks in the 
event of non-compliance with defined processes. To ensure that we 
THE MODULAR STRATEGY 
Our modular platforms and toolkits allow us enormous flexibility 
in the design of our production facilities. The Modular Transverse 
Toolkit (MQB) and Modular Production Toolkit (MPB) enable us to 
cut development costs, manufacturing times and any necessary one-
off expenses, and can also be used over several vehicle generations. 
The toolkits also allow us to use the same production systems in 
the same plant to manufacture different models from different 
brands in varying quantities. This means that we can use our ca-
pacities more flexibly throughout the entire Group, enabling us to 
achieve efficiency gains.
In addition to conventional petrol (gasoline) and diesel engines, the 
MQB also gives us the opportunity to integrate alternative power-
trains, such as natural-gas, hybrid or electric drives. Previously, we 
had to make individual, vehicle-specific adjustments to each model. 
The MQB has created an extremely flexible vehicle architecture that 
permits the specific dimensions stipulated by the design concept – 
such as wheelbase, track width, wheel size and seat position – to be 
harmonized throughout the Group and then applied in flexible ways. 
Other dimensions, such as the distance between the pedals and 
front wheel hubs, are always the same. This ensures that the front 
of the car always conforms to the same system, making it easier 
to exploit synergies. The MQB platform used across the Group was 
installed in the eight millionth vehicle in late 2016.
implement and comply with these and other new requirements, as 
well as all relevant official regulations, we have developed guidelines, 
tips and recommendations for our quality management consultants, 
and provide support as they apply them in practice.
As a further step, we now apply the multiple internal controls princi-
ple – based on mutual support and cross-checks between divisions – 
even more rigorously, and have developed important additional skills 
in, for example, software security. This particularly affects the control 
mechanisms between technical development and quality assurance 
before and after the start of production. In product development, we 
have introduced the same principle for the approval of power units. 
And at the series production stage, we are now working even harder 
to carry out conformity checks on our products with the participation 
of all business units involved, performing assessments and making 
decisions on this basis. This applies particularly to exhaust emissions 
and fuel consumption.
By taking these and other measures, quality assurance is ensuring 
that we not only satisfy all legal requirements imposed on us as a 
manufacturer, but that our products do so as well.
All Group brands are surging ahead with the development of electric 
traction. We have expanded our expertise in this area by bringing 
additional technical specialists and experts on board. Based on the 
experience we have gained with existing vehicle architectures, we 
designed the Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) for the compact 
segment. This can be deployed across multiple brands for passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles alike. The MEB means we can 
now develop very exciting vehicles and supports ranges of 300 to 
600 km (190 to 375 miles) in all-electric mode. It also makes it pos-
sible to factor in vehicle-specific requirements and achieve savings 
by bundling volume purchases. Thanks to the Volkswagen Group’s 
modular toolkit strategy, modules can be deployed across different 
model series and brands, thus achieving substantial synergies. This 
applies in particular to models that share the same platform. We 
have integrated the production of electrified vehicles into the manu-
facturing processes at our existing plants, for example in Wolfsburg, 
Emden, Bratislava, Ingolstadt and leipzig. The electric motors are 
manufactured at our plant in Kassel.
In 2016, we presented our visionary I.D. concept vehicle. With a 
range of up to 600 km (375 miles), the zero-emission vehicle is 
scheduled for market launch in 2020, and represents the vanguard 
of an entirely new fleet of highly innovative electric vehicles based on 
the MEB platform.

Product Responsibility
By taking full responsibility for our products, we aim to keep our customers as safe as possible on the road by offering 
a comprehensive range of road-safety solutions and a broad spectrum of efficient, affordable and practical powertrain 
technologies. The Volkswagen Group takes responsibility for the products supplied by all its brands. This responsibility 
extends to passive and active safety systems, conservation of resources, and climate and environmental protection.  
In particular, we are prioritizing the electrification of our vehicle fleet. one objective of our future program ToGETHEr –  
Strategy 2025 is to significantly increase the proportion of our total sales accounted for by all-electric cars over the next 
few years. This will help us to further reduce carbon emissions and air pollution.
809,000 CARS FROM WOLFSBURG 
In 2016, the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg produced 
around 809,000 vehicles. The plant’s daily production 
capacity now exceeds 3,800 vehicles.
INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION
In 2016, the Volkswagen Group further extended its innovation 
and technology leadership by investing in new models, environ-
mentally compatible drive technologies and optimized production 
processes. At the same time, we aim to step up the efficiency of 
our cross-brand innovation management, as well as the network-
ing of our brands’ development processes. By creating overarching 
technology networks we avoid parallel developments and facilitate 
efficient technology transfer, while simultaneously reducing our 
development costs. At present, 46,000 highly qualified employees 
are working on these projects in research and development facilities 
around the world. The philosophy behind the Volkswagen Group’s 
entire research and development effort is “Innovation for All”. The re-
sult will be new models with even more efficient powertrains. These 
include electric cars powered entirely by battery, as well as plug-in 
hybrids. Our core business as a whole is steadily shifting toward 
electric propulsion as we pursue our electrification initiative, which 
is second to none in the industry. And we are making the necessary 
investments in research into and development of various types of 
electric drive, suitable energy storage solutions, and series produc-
tion of the relevant modules. 
We see mobility as a holistic concept and bundle our mobility- 
related activities under the heading of “Smart Mobility”. Higher 
efficiency, better connectivity and greater flexibility in turn create 
safer, more comfortable and more environmentally compatible 
mobility solutions, making an important contribution to the imple-
mentation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). Examples of this approach include the development of driver 
assistance systems, autonomous (“piloted”) driving and our IT labs. 
To ensure that our approach to mobility remains consistently holistic, 
we are pooling all these activities in our new Mobility Solutions 
business area, which will also be a core element of our TOGETHER 
strategy. We want to redefine the whole concept of mobility, work-
ing closely with selected partners to accomplish this. The first step 
in this direction is our investment in Gett, a ride-hailing service. Gett 
is already operating in more than 100 cities, including major cities 
such as New york, Moscow and london. One out of three taxis in the 
British capital is already using the service to find new customers.
In December 2016, we also set up MOIA, a company dedicated to 
new mobility solutions with a particular focus on ride hailing – the 
instant provision of mobility services. Subsequently, we intend to 
develop or acquire further attractive and prof-itable services tailored 
to customer requirements, such as robot taxis, carsharing, and 
on-demand transport services for the logistics industry. To achieve 
this, we will rely – to a greater extent than hitherto – on partner-
ships, acquisitions and venture capital investments. The selection 
of suitable investments will be managed centrally, with the aim of 
generating maximum value for the Group and its brands.
Audi has reaffirmed its progress in the field of autonomous driving – 
the Audi A7 piloted driving concept car, a research vehicle, is capable 
not only of carrying out all freeway driving maneuvers on its own, 
but also and more importantly, of respecting other road users while 
doing so. “Piloted driving” is made possible by the zFAS driver assis-
tance control unit, a central control system that uses state-of-the-
art, high-performance processors to evaluate signals from all sensors 
in real time, continuously generating a model of the surrounding 
environment. long-range radar sensors, lane-keeping assistants and 
laser scanners – not to mention a high-resolution, wide-angle 3D 
video camera – enable the concept car to change lanes, overtake, 
accelerate and brake on its own, without human intervention.

A WATCHFUL EYE
The new Passat features an optional head-up display (HuD) intended to improve 
road safety. Trip data and alerts are projected onto a screen that slides out in the 
driver’s field of vision. Drivers can thus keep their eyes on the road ahead while 
simultaneously taking note of on-screen information that is seemingly displayed 
two meters in front of the vehicle. Because alerts appear directly in the driver’s line 
of sight, reaction times are reduced. And drivers’ eyes do not have to refocus so 
often from far-field to near-field vision.
The g-tron model range also continues to grow; in addition to the 
Audi A3 Sportback g-tron, Audi will soon bring two more CNG  
models to market. The spring of 2017 saw the launch of the Audi A4  
Avant g-tron and the Audi A5 Sportback g-tron. Compared to a 
petrol- engined car in the same performance class, Audi g-tron mod-
els produce 80% fewer CO2 emissions. They achieve this reduction  
by running on Audi e-gas, a green fuel. 
Volkswagen Group’s IT labs are responding to the digitalization trend. 
They are islands of innovation, where new IT solutions are developed 
in close collaboration with Group specialist departments, external 
research institutions and technology partners. The labs act as test 
laboratories for the Group as a whole, advise on questions about  
future IT developments, and act as an interface with business startups. 
Data:lab in Munich is our center of expertise specializing in big 
data, advanced analytics and machine learning. The Data:lab team 
consists of data scientists, project managers and technology wizards 
who are supported by experts from leading big data firms, research 
institutions and startup companies. Successful projects developed 
by Data:lab include forecasts of customer wishes and predictions of 
customer loyalty, as well as a long-term, all-time forecast for spare 
parts scheduling at our central depot in Kassel. 
We are also opening Digital:lab in Berlin. Projects under develop-
ment here include a digital mobility platform and systems for pro-
cessing traffic-related information generated by vehicles. In addition, 
we are expanding our Smart.Production:lab in Wolfsburg, which 
specializes in Industry 4.0 solutions with a particular focus on the 
use of IT in production and logistics. 
SAFE VEHICLES AND ROAD SAFETY
All our activities are geared to Vision zero, which is to say zero 
fatalities or severe injuries in and due to vehicles manufactured by 
the Volkswagen Group. This has been and continues to be the key 
objective for our work in this area. We take a holistic view of vehicle 
safety, from avoiding accidents completely to reducing or avoiding 
their consequences. The Group’s accident research departments play 
a pivotal role in this work, reconstructing and evaluating accidents  
in order to obtain information that will help boost future vehicle 
safety – findings that feed directly into our vehicle development 
activities, leading to new, user-oriented innovations. 
In best-case scenarios, the powerful, active systems produced by our 
specialists help to avoid accidents from the outset. These include 
emergency braking systems (such as Front Assist) and lane-keeping 
systems (such as lane Assist). Where the collision itself is unavoid-
able, a raft of passive systems avoids or mitigates the consequences 
of the accident for vehicle occupants. In particular, the coordinated 
interaction of the vehicle structure with the occupant retention sys-
tem plays a central role. Our integral safety concept seamlessly com-
bines passive and active systems. For example, following a collision 
involving one of our new vehicles, a multi-collision brake is activated 
to bring the stricken vehicle to a halt and avoid secondary collisions, 
or at least reduce the energy released by the collision.

AIMS AND MEASURES TO IMPROVE SAFETY
The ultimate aim of our Vision zero is: zero fatalities or severe injuries in and due 
to vehicles manufactured by the Volkswagen Group. To progress toward this vision, 
we have set ourselves the following goals:
 § avoidable accidents should not happen,
 § unavoidable accidents will be actively mitigated,
 § the severity of accidents will be minimized.
To achieve these goals, the Group’s accident researchers collect data from real 
traffic accidents. Their investigations include:
 § technical analyses of the vehicles involved to establish the technical  
severity of the accident,
 § medical analyses of injuries suffered by people involved in the accident,
 § psychological analyses of the circumstances surrounding the accident.
The findings of these analyses are used to develop measures to protect people 
inside and outside the vehicle. These include the development of body shell  
concepts, occupant retention systems and new driving assistance systems capable  
of avoiding accidents or mitigating their consequences.
The Volkswagen Group is an active member of the German Road 
Safety Council (DVR), contributing expertise and experience with  
the aim of making mobility safer. We also take part in conferences 
on vehicle safety around the world.

ODORS AND EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLE INTERIORS
The German automotive industry has been concerned about air quality inside 
vehicle interiors since the mid-1980s. From the beginning, Volkswagen has played 
a significant role in development work in this field. For good reason: odors and 
emissions from plastic components inside the vehicle can cause people to feel 
unwell, and in extreme cases may even be harmful to health. To avoid these issues, 
we check the properties of the materials and components we use very carefully. 
Our internal Group standard VW 50180 sets down our requirements for material 
characteristics. Compliance with these requirements is partially verified while com-
ponents are still being designed and developed. And suppliers must demonstrate 
that they are complying with these requirements by the sample prototype inspec-
tion stage at the very latest. In the case of around 20% of the components used in 
Group vehicles, suppliers’ compliance data is further verified in our laboratories. 
In addition to checking materials and components, we also evaluate odors and 
emissions in the passenger compartment when we start the manufacturing stage 
of new concept vehicles and production vehicles. 
PRODUCT SAFETY
Our customers attach the utmost importance to product safety. So 
we take a meticulous approach to quality assurance along the entire 
value chain, from purchasing right through to sales. 
Right at the start, when a vehicle is first being developed, we use 
standardized processes to exclude potential use risks. At the next 
stage, production, we bring the collective experience of our global, 
cross-location network of product safety officers to bear. In their 
work, they rely on lessons-learned processes to ensure that our prod-
ucts stay safe. Because the approach followed by our product safety 
officers has proved its worth, we are now gradually implementing  
it among our suppliers, hence along our entire supply chain.

ECoNoMY    PRODUCT RESPONSIBIlITy
We have established quality specifications for the components and 
operating fluids we use, focusing not only on their functional prop-
erties but also on the durability of the materials from which they 
are made. These specifications provide the framework within which 
Volkswagen’s materials specialists, for example, define and verify 
components’ resistance to aggressive fuels and oils. They do this by 
storing the components to be tested – ranging from individual seals 
or gaskets through to complete fuel-delivery modules – in containers 
filled with the appropriate test fluid.
INFORMATION AND LABELING
Volkswagen Group companies are obliged by law to provide users of their products 
with appropriate information about the risks that may arise from their intended 
use or foreseeable misuse. Group companies fulfil this obligation by providing 
instruction manuals and in specific instances, placing warning stickers inside the 
vehicle. Furthermore, since December 1, 2011, all passenger vehicles manufactured 
in Germany must carry a weight-based efficiency label similar to the energy con-
sumption labels used for household appliances. Efficiency ratings range from A+ 
(highly efficient) to G (inefficient). The label also informs users of fuel consumption, 
annual fuel costs, CO2 emissions and annual tax charges under Germany’s CO2-
based vehicle tax. In the case of electric vehicles, the label provides information on 
energy consumption. All our brands provide details of their models’ fuel consump-
tion and CO2 emissions on their websites. Information on consumption figures and 
emissions for all of the models mentioned in this report can be found in this table. 
The Volkswagen and Audi brands also publish Environmental Commendations 
describing improvements in the environmental performance of new vehicles and 
technologies over their predecessors or reference models. 
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Volkswagen knows that customer satisfaction is one of the most 
important factors contributing to the lasting success of the Compa-
ny. Customer satisfaction is benchmarked across all our brands using 
standardized performance indicators: brand image, desirability, 
future purchase consideration, product quality and brand communi-
cation awareness. 
The “Group KPI” platform is one important instrument supporting 
the targeted management of value-creating measures for each of 
our brands. It provides access to key indicators such as unit sales 
growth and customer loyalty, while also allowing the brands to set 
up their own indicators for tracking customer satisfaction.

In terms of customer satisfaction with their products, Audi and 
Porsche are leaders in the core European markets when compared 
with other Group brands and with their competitors. The other 
brands in the Group also score higher than competing brands.  
In terms of customer satisfaction with dealers, all Group brands 
achieve figures at or above the level of the competition. The 
 Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand has maintained a high level of  
customer loyalty in its core European markets for several years in  
a row. However, the emissions issue had a negative impact on brand 
image, brand trust, and customer satisfaction with products com-
pared with 2015. The loyalty of Audi, Porsche and ŠKODA customers 
has kept these brands in the upper rankings in comparison with 
competitors for a number of years.
We use market research studies to involve our customers in the 
product development process as well. The studies help boost  
customer satisfaction in the long term by providing us with 
the customer perspective on our products and highlighting the 
improvements they would like to see. We also ask for customer 
feedback when evaluating prototypes prior to market launch.
Local Value Added
local production in our most important sales markets is a core 
element of our sustainable growth strategy. The benefits are clear: 
lower logistics costs, procurement prices in line with local market 
conditions, elimination of import duties and immunity from volatile 
exchange rates all contribute to the competitiveness of our brands 
in these markets. And people in the regions benefit as well, because 
we create skilled jobs and contribute to the development of local 
economies by attracting supplier businesses to the areas around our 
production locations. In Pune, India, for example, 69 new supplier 
businesses have been founded since our plant was set up, creating 
around 13,500 direct and indirect jobs. And thanks to the long-term 
presence of partners at the Kaluga site, the plant there can now 
draw on more than 60 local suppliers for the models produced.
Creating jobs in our plants and with our suppliers and strengthening 
regional economies is a key part of our growth strategy. But we don’t 
stop there. As a major player in regional economies and with the aim 
of actively promoting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), we support local projects related to the arts, culture, 
education, the sciences, health and sports, as well as structural 
development and nature conservation in the regions (CSR projects 
worldwide).
And through our payment of taxes and duties, we help ensure that 
state and municipal investments in infrastructure and public welfare 
are possible in many parts of the world.
TAXES AND SUBSIDIES
We pay taxes wherever we add value. Worldwide, we paid around 
€3.3 billion in income taxes; by far the largest proportion of this 
was paid in Germany. In the 2016 fiscal year, the Volkswagen Group 
received €435 million in performance-related public subsidies. Fur-
thermore, government grants of €218 million were deducted from 
the costs of property, plant and equipment, and another €12 million 
in noncash benefits received were not capitalized as asset costs.

Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from 
Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas into our supplier management 
approach. 
In this context, in 2016 we expanded our Code of Conduct for Busi-
ness Partners to include a passage on our duty to promote respon-

tion of sustainability requirements into the procurement process, 
we aim to ensure compliance with our sustainability standards 
along the entire supply chain worldwide. These requirements are 
based on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International 
Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Devel-
opment and the relevant conventions of the Inter national labour 
Organization. They are supplemented by Volkswagen’s Environmen-
tal Policy, the environmental targets and regulations derived from 
it, the Group’s Quality Policy and the Volkswagen Declaration on 
Social Rights.
Not only do we include sustainability requirements in our suppli-
er contracts, we also expect our suppliers to acknowledge these 
sustainability requirements before submitting a quotation. This 
explicit acknowledgement must be updated every twelve months. 
These requirements have been integrated into our contracts with all 
suppliers to General Procurement since November 2013, and into 
our contracts with all suppliers of production materials since january 
2014. They apply to all outsourced goods and services worldwide.
Our Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept rests on three 
pillars: requirements, monitoring and development. We apply these 
three benchmarks to the ongoing assessment and improvement of 
our suppliers’ sustainability performance.
   Environmental protection
   Employees’ rights
   Transparent business relationships
   Fair behavior in the marketplace
   Requirements are contractually 
   mandated

DEVELOPMENT
SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS
Among other data, the Volkswagen Group uses a country risk 
analysis to obtain a clearer picture of social, environmental and 
 human-rights risks in regions where potential suppliers operate 
before entering into negotiations with them. This takes both third- 
party information and in-house empirical data into account. 
To identify current developments as well as long-term structural 
challenges in each country, we rely on the ongoing dialog between 
our brands and the regions during the regular meetings and video 
conferences held by the Sustainability Procurement Network. This 
network supports the continuous exchange of information between 
20+ experts in our Group procurement organizations around the 
world.
The Volkswagen Group also subjects all potential new business part-
ners and suppliers to an integrity check (Business Partner Check). 
By examining the social integrity of potential business partners, we 
aim to reduce the risk of forming relationships that could adversely 
affect the Group and its business. 
In addition, the procurement risk management system constantly 
monitors and analyzes the financial stability of our suppliers. A suite 
of different processes is applied to help eliminate supply risks due  
to supplier failure, but also to minimize the financial impact of crises 
and insolvencies in the supply chain.
Among other activities, our early-warning systems also screen, for 
example, press and Internet coverage of relevant sustainability 
issues. Relevant information is passed on to the appropriate Procure-
ment centers to support internal processes and decision-making.
The Volkswagen Group expects its suppliers to avoid the use of any 
materials made from the smelted ores of conflict minerals. Minerals 
are considered conflict minerals if non-governmental armed groups 
are supported directly or indirectly through their extraction, trans-
portation, trade, handling, processing or export.
Information regarding the facilities used by suppliers or their 
 subcontractors for the smelting or refining of minerals such as tin, 
VOLKSWAGEN KONZERN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

ECoNoMY    SUPPlIER MANAGEMENT 
tantalum, tungsten or gold must be disclosed to the Volkswagen 
Group upon request. 
We call on our suppliers to practice due diligence along the supply 
chain. This includes the implementation of measures to ensure that 
the minerals used by the suppliers – in particular tantalum, tin, 
tungsten and gold – do not directly or indirectly promote or support 
armed conflicts. 
For this purpose, Volkswagen recommends using the standardized 
conflict minerals reporting template made available by the con-
flict-free sourcing initiative (cfsi). Based on the cfsi data, Volkswagen 
will inform suppliers who have business relationships with non- 
compliant smelters and/or refiners about alternative options for 
working with conflict-free smelters and/or refiners.
SUPPLIER MONITORING
In the course of the business process, our business partners are 
required to complete our sustainability questionnaire and to  
document their activities relating to selected areas of responsibility.  
The questionnaire covers the following areas of relevance to  
Volkswagen AG:
 § cooperation and collaboration (also with subcontractors)
 § environmental responsibility
 § employee rights
 § transparent business relationships
By the end of the reporting year, 21,067 of our suppliers had sub-
mitted responses to our questionnaire. This covers 88% of our total 
procurement volume.
Status of Sustainability Questionnaire
We are transferring our sustainability questionnaire over to the 
self-assessment questionnaire developed for use throughout the in-
dustry in a joint project with other automotive corporations involved 
in the European Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain Sus-
tainability organized by CSR Europe. We use the responses to these 
self-assessments to help identify measures to improve performance, 
and then communicate the latter to our suppliers. This means we are 
able to give our suppliers specific, needs-based recommendations 
for improving their sustainability performance.
Alongside the well-established Volkswagen survey, in the reporting  
year 1,336 of our suppliers filled out this multi-OEM industry  
questionnaire, which also includes questions addressing the issue  
of conflict minerals.
We also expect our suppliers to take active responsibility for them-
selves. In the field of environmental protection, we require our main 
suppliers to put in place a certified environmental management 
system in accordance with ISO 14001 and/or EMAS; to date, 87% of 
our suppliers have documented such a system. As part of the EMAS 
and ISO 14001 environmental certification and auditing procedures 
at Volkswagen AG sites, the contractors and suppliers who work on 
the site premises and have an environmental impact are also subject 
to regular audits. In addition, we expect our suppliers to have a 
certified occupational health and safety management system that 
complies with OHSAS 18001, SA8000 and/or AA1000.

Selected business partners identified by the self-assessments or 
internal analysis system as being at increased risk of non-compli-
ance with sustainability requirements are subjected to third-party 
sustainability audits, which cover all aspects of our sustainability 
requirements and include interviews with employees of the selected 
suppliers.
Should the audit uncover non-compliance or areas requiring 
improvement, we work with the supplier to develop a program of 
measures for improving the situation and assist with its implemen-
tation. In the event of serious compliance violations by a supplier, 
we open an “ad-hoc case”. In 2016, an independent external services 
provider carried out a total of 45 audits, resulting in 19 ad-hoc cases. 
This demonstrates the effectiveness of this instrument and helps us 
to take action in more targeted, efficient ways.

ECoNoMY    SUPPlIER MANAGEMENT 
If there is reason to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their subcon-
tractors are failing to comply with our sustainability requirements, 
we ask the party concerned for a written statement using a stan-
dardized report (6D Report). Based on the six points we specify in 
the report, our business partners can describe the status quo and 
any remedial measures. If the answers prove unsatisfactory, we take 
further appropriate steps, such as the examination of documents, 
visits to the supplier’s premises or other customized supplier devel-
opment activities.
Where there is an ad-hoc case or suspected case of non-compli-
ance, the implementation of a series of remedial measures is 
coordinated by the ad-hoc expert team from the relevant brand  
or region, in turn coordinated and supported by the Group’s team 
of ad-hoc experts in Wolfsburg.
AD-HOC EXPERT TEAM:
Every brand and every region has set up an ad-hoc expert 
team. Team members include experts from specialized 
fields such as occupational safety, occupational health, 
environment and personnel. This approach helps us to cover 
all issues which could potentially arise in ad-hoc cases, and 
to address them efficiently. By this means we were able to 
agree on specific improvement measures with affected sup-
pliers during the reporting year, resulting in an optimization 
in their sustainability performance. The ad-hoc expert team 
in Wolfsburg plays a supporting and coordinating role in 
this process.
EXAMPLES OF AD-HOC CASES:
In 2016, we worked with selected suppliers to address 
challenges involved in complying with sustainability 
requirements in their management of subcontractors. Due 
to the complexity of the supply chains involved, we are 
continuing to work on these issues with these suppliers in 
2017.
In another case, a third-party CSR audit documented 
non-compliance with our working-hours policy. We 
worked with the supplier to develop an action plan, and 
the implementation of this plan was monitored by the 
responsible ad-hoc expert team. Ultimately, this approach 
succeeded in establishing a process that will ensure this 
supplier complies with our policy on working hours.

ECoNoMY    SUPPlIER MANAGEMENT 
In addition to these 53 ad-hoc cases, the Internal Audit function 
uncovered an additional 83 cases which resulted in measures being 
agreed with suppliers. These cases involved supplier conduct that 
failed to comply with regulatory or contractual requirements which 
was either reported by individuals or discovered in the course of 
regular program audits.
Because of these infringements and the abovementioned ad-hoc 
cases, 39 business relationships were terminated in the reporting 
period. The increase in terminated business relationships is closely 
related to procedures initiated in response to the results of audits by 
the Internal Audit function.
The internal and external point of contact for suspected cases of 
non-compliance with our sustainability requirements – especially 
where violations of human rights are concerned – is the e-mail  
address sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com.
In addition, both employees and third parties can address possible 
cases of non-compliance via the Volkswagen Group’s national and 
international employee representation bodies, as well as national 
and international trade union federations. The Volkswagen Group’s 
worldwide ombudsman system can also be used to confidentially 
report irregularities to two external lawyers appointed by the Group. 
Since 2014, it has also been possible for information providers to 
communicate anonymously with the ombudsmen via an online 
channel.
SUPPLIER TRAINING
To anchor the Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept more 
firmly throughout the Group, we are making employees more aware 
of and providing training in sustainability issues. The concept of 
“sustainability in the supply chain” is an established part of the skills 
profile for all Procurement employees. In 2016, more than 950 pur-
chasing staff worldwide were given training in this area.
To facilitate ongoing supplier development, in the course of our busi-
ness relations we make an electronic learning (e-learning) module 
on sustainability available in all languages of the countries which 
have been defined as compliance risks. To successfully complete the 
module, suppliers must pass a final test. We made further prog-
ress here in 2016, with 25.000 suppliers – representing 82% of the 
procurement volume – completing the e-learning module by the 
end of the reporting year. For training purposes, this tool is available 
both to the supplier’s workforce and to employees of Volkswagen AG 
Procurement. 
Status of Sustainability e-Learning
Alongside the e-learning format, we also conduct topic-specific  
sustainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers at  
selected locations. During the reporting period, training events 
were organized in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, China, South 
Africa and the U.S. In total, 1,300 employees of more than 800 of 
our suppliers were given training on sustainability issues. The main 
focus of these events was on the “Social rights of employees”. Some 
of these training activities were organized in cooperation with other 
automotive manufacturers under the auspices of the European 
Working Group on Supply Chain Sustainability.
We also organize stakeholder dialogs in order to discuss the concept 
of and structures required to apply our sustainability standards. 
This informed exchange of ideas with representatives of political 
and governmental organizations, civil society, research institutions 
and NGOs, as well as other companies and our suppliers, ensures 
the continuous development of our concept. One such discussion of 
issues surrounding sustainability in supplier relations took place on 
March 1 of the reporting year.
Through our involvement in national and international industry 
and sector associations, we are also working with other automotive 
manufacturers to create shared communication platforms with the 
aim of driving forward sustainability in the supply chain. Volkswagen 
Group is a member of, for example, the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry (VDA) and econsense – the Forum for Sus-
tainable Development of German Business, and is also part of the 
Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG). Audi AG is also involved 
in the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.
In the European Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain 
Sustainability, part of the European Business Network for Corpo-
rate Social Responsibility (CSR Europe), we are working to develop 
recognized frames of reference for companies in the automotive  
industry. In collaboration with other members of this working 
group, we have developed an industry-wide self-assessment 
questionnaire on sustainability performance, and offered related 
training courses to suppliers.
VOLKSWAGEN KONZERN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

ECoNoMY    SUPPlIER MANAGEMENT 
In the context of our VDA activities, the VDA issued a “Recommenda-
tion for guiding principles in the automotive industry for improving 
sustainability in the supply chain” for the first time in 2016. These 
guiding principles not only advocate more sustainability in the sup-
ply chain, but also recommend the use of the standardized self-as-
sessment questionnaire developed by the European Working Group 
on Supply Chain Sustainability. We hope that this will also encour-
age our direct suppliers to make greater use of this questionnaire for 
their subcontractors.
In the reporting year, as part of our implementation of the OECD’s 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals 
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, the Volkswagen Group 
of America became a member of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative. 
As part of our efforts to work with our suppliers to minimize the 
negative environmental impacts of our vehicles, Volkswagen joined 
the CDP Supply Chain Program in 2015. We foster direct contact with 
our suppliers by organizing specialist workshops in which we discuss 
and develop joint, innovative approaches for the environmental 
optimization of certain components.
The Future Automotive Supply Tracks (FAST) initiative also plays 
a key role in our supplier development strategy. FAST is Group 
Procurement’s core initiative for developing the Volkswagen Group 
and its supply network, both to ensure a strong future and to involve 
suppliers in key goals earlier and more intensively. In addition to 
innovation and globalization, the FAST dialogs also focus on sustain-
ability issues.
SUMMARY
Throughout all process steps and supplier development measures, 
our top priority is to maintain a balanced dialog in a fair-minded 
spirit of partnership. Keeping this key objective of ongoing, sustain-
able collaboration firmly in mind, we work with our suppliers to find 
even more opportunities to improve sustainability, such as boosting 
resource efficiency and continuously improving working conditions.
The Volkswagen Group reserves the right to verify business partners’ 
compliance with our sustainability requirements, either by in-house 
experts or by external audits on suppliers’ premises, as outlined 
above. In the event of non-compliance with our sustainability require-
ments, in extreme cases we will terminate the business relationship, 
especially if the supplier shows no interest in improvement. Our  
top priority, however, is to create a sustainable supply chain by 
encouraging proactive compliance with our sustainability require-
ments through dialog with and the ongoing development of our 
business partners. 
Together with our suppliers, we aim to become even better!
OUTLOOK FOR 2017
In 2017, we plan to perform the same number of sustainability 
audits as in 2016, supplemented by a pilot process for on-site assess-
ment of compliance with our sustainability requirements.
Moreover, our objectives for 2017 include the provision of train-
ing that aims to continuously build our suppliers’ and employees’ 
awareness of and capacity to engage with sustainability issues.
We also intend to step up our engagement in industry-wide working 
groups and initiatives. In particular, we plan to continue rolling 
out the self-assessment questionnaire developed by the CSR Europe 
working group and use its findings to further enhance the processes 
of the Volkswagen Group procurement network. Furthermore, with 
respect to certain selected raw materials, we intend to work with 
the relevant business partners to identify ways of creating greater 
transparency along the supply chain.
With respect to reducing CO2 emissions, we are intending to imple-
ment a project for closed-loop aluminium scrap recycling. In addition 
to conserving resources, this project will also lower the carbon foot-
print associated with the use of aluminium sheeting.
And in the area of collaborative initiatives, in 2017 we will be lead 
partner in the DRIVE Sustainability initiative.

The Volkswagen AG is currently undergoing the most far-reaching process of change in the Company’s history. painful 
experience, especially the massive loss of trust that followed the diesel crisis, has made it clear that when it comes  
to integrity, our primary aim must be to become a role model for a modern, transparent and successful enterprise. This 
intention represents one of the key objectives of our ToGETHEr – Strategy 2025.

ECoNoMY    INTEGRITy 
On january 1, 2016, the Volkswagen Group created a new Board of 
Management position for “Integrity and legal Affairs”, laying the 
organizational groundwork for centralized integrity management 
across the Group.
The integrity management function is responsible for planning, pre-
paring and implementing programs and projects aimed at raising, 
clarifying and intensifying a collective awareness of integrity, as 
well as reinforcing a shared culture of integrity within the Company. 
Key components of the integrity management function include a 
continuous exchange of ideas and dialog concerning integrity-relat-
ed issues.
Because we value a neutral outside perspective, in October 2015 
the Volkswagen Group appointed a Sustainability Council of leading 
experts in research, academia, science and politics. Their remit is to 
provide advice on, among other things, questions of business ethics 
and integrity. With their independent expertise and recommenda-
tions, they will support our efforts to fulfil our social responsibilities, 
promote integrity, foster our stakeholder dialog, and help drive the 
steady, sustainable progress of our corporate development.
Together, we intend to live by a new, partnership-based culture of in-
tegrity in which we can all believe, and of which we can all be proud.
INTEGRITY PROGRAM
The Volkswagen Group’s goal is to enhance the culture of integrity in 
the Company and create a collective awareness of integrity. To this 
end, in 2016 we launched an integrity campaign that included in a 
series of activities designed to encourage all employees to engage 
with the topic of integrity. At the end of December 2016, we moved 
from the integrity campaign to a multi-dimensional integrity pro-
gram that is based on six action areas:

Ethical behavior is a prerequisite for the business success and 
successful future of our Company. Only with enduring and depend-
able integrity can the Company gain and strengthen the trust of its 
employees, customers, shareholders and business partners. Each 
and every one of our employees – and especially our managers – is 
asked to ensure that integrity becomes an integral part of our daily 
working lives.
DIALOG & COMMUNICATION
In September 2016, we launched an intensive communication 
cam paign in Wolfsburg. In the first phase, we raised employee 
awareness of the topic of integrity by deploying visual messages on 
posters, displays and monitors throughout the production site. This 
was followed by a second phase in which employees were actively 
included in the dialog, and various participatory activities such  
as an employee survey were conducted as part of a special event at  
a works meeting. Next, we accepted volunteers from all parts of the 
company and levels of the hierarchy as Integrity Ambassadors for 
our Sounding Board program. 
SOUNDING-BOARD-PROGRAM
Through the Integrity Ambassadors, the Sounding Board program 
ensures close collaboration and dialog between the integrity man-
agement team and the workforce.
In Wolfsburg, 140 Integrity Ambassadors for the Volkswagen Passen-
ger Cars brand are already playing an active role in our transformation 
process by acting as liaisons in their departments, communicating 
the importance of integrity, encouraging networking and actively 
supporting our culture of integrity. Our goal is to establish permanent 
lines of communication between our employees and the integrity 
management team. We also look to the Integrity Ambassadors to help 
us analyze ethical dilemmas which may arise in our specialist depart-
ments and spotlight positive examples of ethical behavior within the 
Company.
In addition, the Sounding Board program also organizes several 
interactive events each quarter which provide a platform for the 
ambassadors to actively share ideas with the integrity management 
function and the Board Member for Integrity and legal Affairs.
EXECUTIVE PROGRAM
The entire Group Board of Management signed a letter to all 
executives and managers in the Company, clearly emphasizing the 
responsibility of each and every member of management to serve 
as a role model for integrity. The topic of integrity has also been high 
on the agenda at many management meetings, including the Global 
Top Management Conference, the Governance, Risk and Compliance 
Global Conference, and other Group management information 
events.
PROCESSES & TOOLS
As part of our sustainability drive, and with the aim of establishing 
integrity as the bedrock of our business practices, we are also inte-
grating ethical practices into our personnel recruitment and training 
processes.
And by including a question about ethics in our annual employee 
opinion survey, we hope to be able to draw conclusions about the 
culture of integrity at Volkswagen and identify when there is a con-
crete need for action to address a specific issue
MONITORING & REPORTING
Regular monitoring of the measures defined in each action area 
helps us to fine-tune and readjust our integrity program. Our own 
reporting on the effectiveness of measures that have been imple-
mented also plays an important role.
INTERNATIONALIZATION
Since October 2016, the Group integrity management function has 
been working closely with the brands and companies to plan, formu-
late and roll out the successive expansion of the integrity program. 
The employees responsible for governance, risk and compliance 
within the brands and companies are playing an important role in 
this process.

In the long term, a company can only be successful if it acts with 
integrity, complies with statutory provisions worldwide and stands 
by its voluntary undertakings and ethical principles, even when  
this is the harder choice.
We remain committed to this principle – especially in light of the 
misconduct uncovered in the 2015 fiscal year, which runs contrary  
to all of the values that Volkswagen stands for. Compliance must  
be second nature to all Group employees.
By raising awareness and educating employees, Volkswagen aims to 
prevent potential breaches before they occur. Nevertheless, we are 
aware that even the best compliance management system can never 
entirely prevent criminal actions by individuals.
The principles set down in the Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct  
are of essential importance here. These guidelines have been 
communicated and can be accessed by all Group employees via the 
Volkswagen portal, and on the web pages of the Volkswagen Group.  
The Group’s Internal Audit, Security, Personnel Management and 
legal departments are responsible for investigative measures and 
responses.
Since january 2016, the Group Chief Compliance Officer has reported 
directly to the Board Member for Integrity and legal Affairs. The 
Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported in his work by 14 Chief 
Compliance Officers (responsible for the brands, Volkswagen Financial 
Services and Porsche Holding GmbH in Salzburg, Austria), who are in 
turn assisted by Compliance Officers in the Group companies. The 
compliance organization is networked together by various arrange-
ments, including regional workshops. One networking event held in 
the organization in the reporting year was a major Governance, Risk 
& Compliance (GRC) Global Conference in Berlin. It was attended  
by some 300 employees from 30 nations and all Group brands, who 
shared their ideas in workshops and presentations focusing on 
current and upcoming issues in compliance and risk management.
Various bodies support the work of the compliance organization 
at Group and brand company level. These include the Compliance 
Board at senior management level and the core Compliance team, 
which pools Group expertise in compliance issues.
In 2016, the CEO of Volkswagen AG, Matthias Müller, made the following statement  
at a management meeting in Wolfsburg
“We want to make integrity the fundamental bedrock 
of everything we do across the entire Group. With this 
aim, we will redouble our Group-wide efforts to comply  
with regulations and legislation.” He continued:  
“Compliance is not a job for a single individual or  
department. It is something that as managers, we must 
all treat as an integral part of our responsibilities.”
COMPLIANCE AT VOLKSWAGEN
Volkswagen applies a holistic approach to compliance which in-
tegrates its compliance management system (CMS), risk manage-
ment system (RMS) and internal control system (ICS). One way to 
identify and assess potential compliance risks is to use a standard 
process that is now in place across the Group. Thanks to this pro-
cess for cataloging systemic risks, in the reporting year more than 
2,400 assessments of potential compliance risks and the relevant 
remedial measures were reported by more than 100 units; more 
than 500 tests were staged within Group companies to evaluate 
the effectiveness of these measures. Based on the findings of  
such tests, preventive measures are drawn up and the appropriate 
compliance programs defined. During the selection process for  
new production locations, Group Production assesses the sites  
with a view to identifying potential corruption risks, among others.

ECoNoMY    COMPlIANCE
COMPLIANCE MEASURES
In response to the diesel crisis, we have developed activities targeting 
improved product compliance in the development and production 
process, as well as in quality assurance. Furthermore, development 
processes have been designed in such a way that even an attempt  
to circumvent mandatory regulations is easier to identify and prevent 
at an early stage. In this context, we have further strengthened con-
formity assessments for our products, among other things.
What is more, in the reporting period we expanded the range of  
services for providing our employees with advice and support, ex-
tending our advisory services and our range of online tutorials.  
We also published a new information guide for our staff on how  
to prevent money laundering.
PREVENTION THROUGH INFORMATION 
To raise awareness of the importance of compliance, since 2010 all 
new employment contracts entered into between Volkswagen AG on 
the one part, and both management staff and employees covered by 
collective agreements on the other, have included a reference to the 
Code of Conduct plus the obligation to comply with it. Completion 
of the online training module on the Code of Conduct is mandatory 
for all new employees. Since 2014, compliance with the Code of 
Conduct has been a factor in calculating employees’ variable, perfor-
mance-related pay component.
By means of appropriate preventive measures integrated in our 
existing management system, we foster compliance with the rules 
within our organization and sharpen our employees’ awareness. 
However, we are also aware that the risk of individual misconduct 
can never be completely eliminated. To raise employee awareness of 
compliance-related issues, we use both traditional communication 
channels such as employee magazines and information stands, and 
electronic media such as intranet portals, apps, blogs, audio-pod-
casts and online newsletters and guidelines. For example, our Anti- 
Corrup tion Guidelines are available worldwide to all employees, 
The structure and procedures of the Volkswagen Group whistleblow-
ing system have been completely reorganized. A guideline issued 
by the Group’s Board of Management sets out clear protections for 
both information providers and those under investigation. As of 
2017, the Board Member for Integrity and legal Affairs is responsible 
for the process of recording and analyzing the information reported 
by whistleblowers. As before, Group Internal Audit and Group Secu-
rity are responsible for investigations.
business partners and members of our governance bodies on the 
Volkswagen portal as well as the Internet. 
Business partners of the Volkswagen Group are subject to a Business 
Partner Check, a risk-oriented assessment of their integrity. With the 
aid of the “Volkswagen Group requirements regarding sustainability 
in its relationships with business partners” (Code of Conduct for 
business partners), we raise supplier awareness of issues such as 
human rights.
In 2016, around 187,000 employees across the Group took part in 
more than 6,000 classroom and e-learning courses on the topics of 
compliance in general, as well as money laundering, the Code of 
Conduct, competition and antitrust legislation, human rights and 
combating corruption. Online e-learning programs and classroom 
training courses are firmly anchored in existing corporate processes. 
Employees of Volkswagen AG, all brand companies and a large num-
ber of Group companies are able to obtain personal advice about 
compliance issues by contacting the compliance organization via a 
dedicated e-mail address.

carries out random checks irrespective of any suspicion of non-com-
pliance and investigates whenever actual breaches are suspected. 
The worldwide ombudsman system in place since 2006 can be used 
to confidentially report corruption, fraudulent activities or other seri-
ous irregularities (such as human rights violations or ethical miscon-
duct) in 11 different languages to two external lawyers appointed by 
the Group. Naturally, the people providing the information need not 
 fear being punished by the Company for doing so.
As of December 2014, there is also the option of using an additional 
online channel to communicate with the ombudsmen. A technically 
secure digital mailbox allows suspected breaches to be reported – 
anonymously, if so desired. After checking them for plausibility, in 
2016 the ombudsmen passed on 125 reports to the Volkswagen 
Group’s Anti-Corruption Officer, the Head of Group Internal Audit; 
the identities of the individuals providing the information were 
kept confidential if requested. In addition, information on a further 
110 cases was given directly to the Anti-Corruption Officer. During 
local internal audits of the brands and Group companies, 481 reports 
were submitted to the Anti-Corruption Officer.
All such reports are followed up. For all breaches of the law and vio-
lations of internal regulations, necessary sanctions are first reviewed 
and then applied where necessary. In 2016, action was taken against 
a total of 121 employees across the Volkswagen Group as a result 
of the findings of investigations based on information received as 
described above. In 53 of these cases worldwide, the employee’s con-
tract was terminated. Moreover, in the reporting year, following spe-
cial audits that were based on information received, ten contracts 
with business partners were terminated or not renewed due to 
 non-compliance with contractual conditions for avoiding corruption.
A risk-oriented assessment of the Group’s core business processes 
provides the basis for the auditing program of Group Internal Audit, 
the China region, and the eight other Group Audit departments op-
erated by brands with local audit functions. The business processes 
of all Volkswagen Group companies are systematically classified in 
terms of risks which, in the auditors’ view, are relevant to the audit. 
The issues with the highest risk levels are incorporated into the 
auditing programs. In 2016, a total of 1,274 audits were conducted 
across the Volkswagen Group worldwide. Among other things, these 
audits examine internal control mechanisms for the prevention 
of corruption (dual-control principle, segregation of functions), 
the existence of compliance guidelines and preventive measures.

ECoNoMY    RATINGS AND INDICES
Another aspect of the audit function is advising the Volkswagen 
Group’s specialist departments. In particular, this advisory activity 
helps to define processes, ensure they are designed in compliance 
with internal standards, and that they can be applied worldwide. 
In addition, a Continuous Auditing System has been installed. This 
function is responsible for, among other things, using structured 
analysis of data in the financial systems to boost the effectiveness 
of the Internal Control System (ICS). The continuous auditing pro-
cedures help to identify specific weak points in the ICS more rapidly 
and so avoid losses. 
In accordance with the normative standards issued by the German 
Institute for Internal Auditing (DIIR), internal audit functions should 
be audited externally at least once every five years. An external 
quality assessment of the Volkswagen Group’s internal audit system 
was carried out by an audit firm in the period between the third 
quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. In addition to central 
management and supervisory processes, this took into consideration 
the quality of the brands’ and regions’ internal audit functions (sam-
ple size: Volkswagen AG, AUDI AG, SEAT S.A., Volkswagen de Mexico, 
Volkswagen Group China). The audit firm confirmed that all the 
internal audit units examined are fully compliant with the underly-
ing DIIR Standard No. 3 “Quality management in the internal audit 
activity” and in many areas, use leading internal audit methodologies 
and practices. In 2016, the internal quality management function 
also saw further development, and a continuous improvement pro-
cess was initiated under the auspices of Group Internal Audit.
Ratings and Indices
Because analysts and investors view corporate social responsibility  
(CSR) and sustainability as key indicators of forward-looking 
corporate governance, their recommendations and decisions are 
increasingly based on factors that include companies’ CSR and  
sustainability profiles. They look to sustainability ratings in particular 
to evaluate a company’s performance in terms of environmental 
compatibility, social responsibility and economy. Achieving top 
marks in these ratings not only sends a clear signal to stakeholders, 
but also helps make a company more attractive as an employer and 
boosts the motivation of its employees.
Before the emissions issue, Volkswagen held leading positions in 
sustainability rankings and indices such as the Dow jones Sustain-
ability Indices, the CDP Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustainalytics 
and oekom research. However, Volkswagen has now been down-
graded or removed from these ratings.

pEopLE    SHAPING CHANGE
People
Shaping Change
Across its 12 brands, the Volkswagen Group aims to be an attractive employer and a good partner for society. reliability, 
trustworthiness and fairness are our watchwords – no matter whether we are talking to individual employees, nego-
tiating with collective representative bodies, collaborating with regional partners in local infrastructure development 
projects, or cooperating with civil society initiatives and associations. 
our human resources strategy seeks to ensure that the Group and our workforce are well placed to adapt to the ever 
more rapidly evolving challenges of the networked digital world. The in-service training we offer enables our employees 
to keep their knowledge and skills up to date, while individual health programs boost their fitness and performance 
levels. our newly introduced Diversity policy is helping to promote culture change and equal opportunities. And through 
our involvement in numerous social projects around the globe, we are ensuring our company is firmly anchored in local 
communities. 
As a global enterprise with 120 production sites across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa, we have wide-ranging 
experience of cultural differences, approaches and world views. our company is committed to respect, tolerance and 
openness, and we ensure equal opportunities and equal treatment for all our employees around the world. We also 
engage with stakeholders in numerous ways to promote the sustainable development of the towns, cities and regions 
in which we operate.

pEopLE    MANAGEMENT APPROACH 
Management Approach 
For 70 years now, industrial relations at Volkswagen have been guided 
by a social pact that enables employees and their elected represent-
atives to exercise their long-established and extensive rights to have 
a say in the running of the company. From this a unique model for 
the cooperative resolution of disagreements between the social part-
ners has evolved. In its human resources policies,  Volkswagen explic-
itly realizes the potential of this model with its focus on conciliation, 
consensus and continuity in order to 
 § appropriately remunerate good performance,
 § benefit from the careful selection and long-term service  
of employees to maximize upskilling,
 § capitalize on workers’ consultation rights to help drive  
continuous improvement processes, and
 § systematically harness the team spirit of our workforce to  
achieve our strategic goals. 
This approach is founded on our conviction that sustainably excellent 
performance is only possible if the company is seen to be an attrac-
tive employer which, as well as providing a safe workplace where the 
latest tools are used, offers employees stimulating work, optimally 
supports them as individuals and is well integrated in society. 
On launching its TOGETHER 2025 strategy in October 2016, the 
Volkswagen Group also approved a new “We empower to perform” 
human resources strategy with five overarching objectives for per-
sonnel management:
 § The Volkswagen Group aims to be an excellent employer across  
all its brands and companies worldwide. 
 § Highly skilled, dedicated employees strive for excellence in terms 
of innovation, added value and customer focus.
 § Sustainable work practices ensure optimal working conditions  
in factories and offices.
 § An exemplary corporate culture creates a work climate character-
ized by openness, mutual trust and cooperation.
 § While striving for operational excellence and strategic added value, 
personnel management within the Group is strongly focused on 
employees. 
THE FIVE OBJECTIVES OF THE  
“WE EMPOWER TO PERFORM” STRATEGY
With its new “We empower to perform” strategy, the Volkswagen 
Group is continuing to pursue the successful key tenets of its human 
resources policy. As well as seeking to appropriately balance perfor-
mance and remuneration, these include its strong stakeholder focus, 
comprehensive employee participation rights, excellent training 
opportunities and systematic retention programs. The new human 
resources strategy is also setting innovative new trends: modern 
forms of work such as agile working – where managers and team 
members work together to increase the efficiency with which all 
tasks are performed – are set to be expanded on many fronts, while 
collaborative robots will take on heavy lifting work in factories in the 
future and digital processes will simplify many administrative tasks. 
By 2020, the Volkswagen Group will roll out a diversity management 
system, not only to ensure that men and women are treated equally, 
but also to prevent other forms of discrimination – against people 
with performance impairments, for example – and to support the 
development of each individual employee in accordance with their 
own particular abilities. In addition, culture change initiatives are 
already underway to establish flatter hierarchies, a more open form 
VOLKSWAGEN KONZERN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016
56
pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: ExCEllENT EMPlOyER
of collaboration and a greater focus on the big picture within the 
Company’s divisions. To benefit both the Group and its employees, 
working times and locations are also set to become more flexible. 
More weight will be attached to social sustainability and it will be 
systematically incorporated into our human resources strategy: in 
the future, personnel management will more quickly and consis-
tently reflect social and cultural megatrends, such as employees’ 
aspirations to participate in decision-making for instance. The tradi-
tional focus of personnel management – such as providing optimal 
support and training opportunities for employees along with the 
careful planning and deployment of human resources – will also 
continue to apply.
We have developed our “We empower to perform” strategy against 
the backdrop of a rapidly changing situation in the automotive 
industry, where we are seeing the automobile world undergoing 
the greatest period of disruption in its history. Our human resources 
strategy is designed to help the Volkswagen Group become a global 
leader in mobility on a long-term profitable and sustainable basis. At 
the core of this strategy is our mission to be an excellent employer. 
In setting ourselves this strategic objective, we are expressly under-
scoring our intention to remain, well into the future, an outstanding 
employer whose skilled and high-performing workforce is at the 
forefront of the automotive value chain. 
A first-rate team of this kind does not just come about by accident, 
however. It is the product of extensive investment and carefully 
developed concepts for training, upskilling, employee support and – 
last but by no means least – maintaining and improving health and 
fitness.
Strategic Objective: 
Excellent Employer
Seeking to be an attractive employer is not an end in itself. We will 
only be able to sustain the enduring commitment and motivation 
of our employees if we keep the promises we have made about the 
working conditions in our company. And only if we can make these 
promises visible, credible and transparent to the outside world will 
we be perceived as attractive in an increasingly competitive talent 
market and consequently be able to attract the best people to the 
company. 
The “We empower to perform” strategy fuses these two perspectives 
by seamlessly integrating our consistent promise as an employer 
with the employee experience, i.e. how our quality as an employer is 
actually experienced on a day-to-day basis. 
We may not always succeed in uniting these different perspectives in 
everyday life, but we are evidently succeeding more and more often –  
despite the diesel crisis, in 2016 we received a number of awards for 
being an attractive employer and topped various employer rankings. 
For instance, the Volkswagen Group ranked third among engineer-
ing, IT and business graduates in the trendence institute’s survey of 
the most attractive employers in Europe. And, as in the previous year, 
trendence’s poll of over 300,000 engineering, IT and business grad-
uates from a total of 24 European countries voted the Volkswagen 
Group the most popular employer in the automotive sector.
In 2016, trendence’s young Professionals Barometer, which mea-
sures the career aspirations and expectations of some 10,000 young 
professionals with up to eight years’ work experience from across 
all sectors, ranked our Audi brand third and our sports car maker 
Porsche sixth. In the wake of the diesel scandal, the Volkswagen 
brand saw a drop in its popularity from 16th to 31st. In a similar sur-
vey carried out by the Universum market research institute in which 
experienced engineers were asked to state their ideal employer, 
Audi took second place while Porsche came third. The Volkswagen 
brand ranked seventh. 
Among Czech graduates, trendence found ŠKODA Auto to be the most 
popular employer. In a number of other countries, including the 
United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, South Africa and China, Volkswagen 
and its 12 brands rank among the most respected employers.

pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: ExCEllENT EMPlOyER
Alongside the external impression that graduates and young 
professionals have of us, there is of course also an internal perspec-
tive – how our own employees view their workplace and working 
environment. Personnel management at the Volkswagen Group is 
therefore endeavoring to create conditions at all levels that will de-
liver a positive experience of Volkswagen as an employer. Along with 
providing interesting jobs and attractive working conditions, our 
guiding principles are designed to underline the status of employ-
ees as confident, entrepreneurial, creative people who are involved 
in decision-making. In particular, we would like to highlight three 
aspects 
 § the codification of Group-wide employment rights in  
guidelines and charters
 § the involvement of employees through their elected  
representatives
 § the entitlement of our workforce to a share in profits.
EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
The foundations underpinning the provision of attractive, long-term 
working conditions are a raft of charters and declarations agreed 
with our Group European Works Council (GEWC) and Global Group 
Works Council (GGWC) which govern the collective rights of our 
employees in the workplace and the organization of their work. 
These include: 
 § The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen (the Volkswagen Social Charter). Volkswagen set out 
the fundamental social rights of employees in this declaration in 
2002. These are based on the relevant conventions of the Interna-
tional labour Organization. A revised version of the Social Charter 
was signed in 2012.
 § The Charter on labor Relations. This charter came into force in 
autumn 2009 and combines greater rights to consultation with 
shared responsibilities. It defines the rights to information, consul-
tation and co-determination enjoyed by employee representatives 
from brands, companies and sites represented on the GEWC and 
the GGWC.
 § The Charter on Temporary Work. In November 2012, Volkswagen’s 
executive management, the GEWC and GGWC signed a char-
ter setting out the principles governing temporary work. These 
included, for example, a guide ratio of temporary employees to 
core workforce, stipulations on equal pay, equal treatment and 
qualification programs, plus a time limit of 36 months before the 
offer of a permanent position must be considered. 
 § The Charter on Vocational Education and Training. As well as a 
high standard of education, the Group is seeking to offer attractive 
training opportunities at its various locations. Approved in 2015, 
this charter recognizes vocational training as a core aspect of labor 
relations. To comply with the charter, the social partners must 
jointly define certain aspects such as the trainee selection process, 
the duration and quality of vocational training, plus the conditions 
for subsequently hiring trainees following an apprenticeship. 
These policy foundations underpin the rights of elected employee 
representatives at the Group level in the European and Global Works 
Councils. They provide a binding framework for developing existing 
local labor relations in a responsible manner using cooperative con-
flict resolution approaches.
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION THROUGH ELECTED  
REPRESENTATIVES AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
Volkswagen has an internationally recognized culture of co-determi-
nation. At many sites, employees are represented in two ways: firstly, 
by a trade union, and secondly, by representatives elected to a works 
council. Many companies in the Group also have a supervisory board 
on which the workforce is represented. The International Charter on 
labor Relations allows employee representatives around the world 
to conclude agreements with local management on specific rights to 
information, consultation and co-determination.
This widespread form of participation has proved highly successful 
over many decades. When major changes are expected, such as in 
the case of the pact negotiated in 2016 regarding the future of the 
Volkswagen brand for example, employee representatives are in-
volved in the planning process from an early stage. This ensures that 
such processes of change are tackled jointly and have the support  
of all employees. These co-determination structures are by no means 
static, however. Our international employee representative bodies 
are constantly being adapted in line with the ongoing development 
of the Group. In addition to the Group European Works Council and 
the Group Global Works Council (set up in 1990 and 1999 respective-
ly), in recent years a number of committees have also been estab-
lished to reflect the increasing complexity of the Group (such as com-
mittees specifically concerned with commercial vehicles, financial 
services and sales companies, mechanical engineering and so forth). 
In 2016, the decision was taken to set up a separate committee for 
the Volkswagen brand itself, due to start work in 2017. The commit-
tees of the European Works Council and the Global Works Council  
meet at least once a year. In addition, all members of these two 
works councils attend a joint session every year. As well as exchang-
ing information internally and discussing the current situation at 
the various sites, the respective HR managers and Group executive 
management also share information about future product and work-
force plans and consult each other on social welfare and personnel 
standards.

pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: ExCEllENT EMPlOyER
REMUNERATION, REWARDING PERFORMANCE,  
PROFIT-SHARING AND RETIREMENT PROVISION
As stated in our Social Charter, all remuneration and benefits paid 
for a normal working week should at the very least correspond to 
the respective statutory minimums – and this applies not only to our 
employees, but to all our suppliers too. Because they are collectively 
agreed with trade unions, however, nearly everywhere our rates  
of pay are considerably higher than the prevailing minimum levels. 
When setting pay, we make no gender distinctions: people are 
recruited, hired and promoted solely on the basis of their qualifica-
tions and skills. Remuneration is based strictly on the job performed. 
A total of nine new collective agreements were concluded at inter-
national car production plants in 2016. In some cases, these involved 
industrial action: strikes were held at lamborghini, Ducati and Italde-
sign during national pay negotiations within the Italian metalworking 
and electrical engineering industry. There was also a stoppage at 
Scania in São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil during collective bargaining 
talks. Group sites in Brazil and Belgium were affected by politically 
motivated strikes. A regional strike against planned cost-cutting mea-
sures and government reforms triggered a one-day strike at Volkswa-
gen do Brasil’s Anchieta plant. Workers at Audi’s factory in Brussels 
also took part in protests as part of national strike action against 
actual and planned government cutbacks and reforms. As a company, 
we respect the right of our employees to take part in lawful strikes. 
Together with remuneration packages that include a profit-related  
element so employees can share in the company’s success, the 
systematic encouragement and rewarding of good performance are 
key qualities of an excellent employer. Since 2010, Volkswagen AG 
has consistently applied standard criteria for skills development and 
performance assessment across its entire workforce, from appren-
tices to top managers, which are underpinned by concrete incentive 
programs within the pay structure.
Salaried employees at Volkswagen AG are paid according to  
a three-tier system:
 § basic pay in the form of a competitive monthly salary,
 § a performance-related component which additionally rewards 
individual performance and
 § an entitlement to profit-sharing, which is laid down in the  
collective agreement.
This three-tier system has proved to be an expedient way of  
enabling employees to share in the company’s success. 
Employees of Group companies in Germany and around the world 
also enjoy further company benefits.
Along with an attractive remuneration package for our active em-
ployees, we are also concerned to make provision for those embark-
ing on the next stage of their life. By offering occupational pension 
schemes, Volkswagen AG, its brands and subsidiaries make an import-
ant contribution to ensuring that retirees still have an income in later 
life. In addition to employer contributions, employees can convert part 
of their pre-tax salary into pension contributions. They can also opt 
to defer a further proportion of their compensation in the form of a 
direct retirement insurance contract.
Volkswagen AG’s Time Asset Bond is a scheme for reducing the length  
of an employee’s working life. Since 1998, employees have had the 
option to contribute to the bond out of their gross pay and working 
time credits. They can then use the time assets accumulated to take 
paid time off in the run-up to retirement. Such benefits also help 
boost our attractiveness as an employer in the long term. 
Depending on location, benefits may also include subsidized trans port 
and meals, low-cost accommodation, monthly childcare allowances 
and discounts on selected leisure activities. Additional healthcare 
or supplementary pension benefits round off the range of company 
benefits offered.
The extensive social rights enjoyed by employees, strong workforce 
representation, participation in decision-making processes, perfor-
mance-related remuneration and good retirement provision form  
the building blocks of our attractiveness as an employer, which  
together constitute the bedrock of our human resources policy. These 
aspects are further augmented by numerous initiatives, agreements 
and programs which aim to develop our workforce and create ver-
satile first-rate teams.

pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: SKIllED AND COMMITTED EMPlOyEES 
Strategic Objective: 
Skilled and Committed Employees 
The second goal of our human resources strategy is to cultivate skilled 
and committed employees. For us, commitment means first and 
foremost actively participating and helping to add value, using one’s 
initiative, but also taking change in one’s stride and personally initiat-
ing process improvements. It also means seeing the bigger picture and 
taking an interest in the environment or events and developments in 
society at large.
ON-THE-JOB COMMITMENT
We like to see our employees tackling their work enthusiastically, 
showing commitment and team spirit while contributing their 
expertise. In return, we invest in our workforce, foster a good 
working atmosphere and offer attractive opportunities for career 
development. As well as listening to their opinions and constructive 
criticism, this includes actively involving employees in improving  
processes and assuring quality. One tool used for this purpose 
throughout the Group is our Employee Opinion Survey 
. We use 
this standardized Group-wide employee survey to obtain regular 
feedback on employee satisfaction, and by extension on the extent  
to which we have fulfilled our goal of being an attractive employer. 
The survey also helps to systematically identify scope for improve-
ment and pinpoint the areas where managers need to take action 
within their organizational units. In 2016, we revised the Employee 
Opinion Survey to include additional questions and new tools to 
help line managers discuss the results with employees. The 2016 
survey was conducted at 172 sites and companies in 45 countries. 
Approximately 440,000 of over 540,000 employees in the partici-
pating Group companies responded; this is equivalent to a response 
rate of 81%. In 2016, the score on the employee satisfaction index – 
a key indicator generated by the opinion survey – was 78 out of 100.
We also rely on participation to make ongoing improvements to 
our production systems. All the Group’s vehicle brands use stan-
dardized production systems which are continually developed with 
input from employees. On the basis of four company agreements on 
the “Volkswagen Way”, the Volkswagen brand workforce has been 
involved in improving organizational efficiency since 2007. This has 
been done using a variety of tools and methods designed to contin-
uously improve processes and structures in the areas of productivity, 
quality, ergonomics, leadership and teamwork. Using “train the 
trainer” methods, the Group and brands are gradually bringing all 
their plants up to speed. A trainer from the Group provides support 
to participants during the initial stages of this pilot. By training 
jointly, group and team leaders gain a greater understanding of each 
other’s roles while everyone attains the same level of knowledge.
This is not just limited to our plants in Germany. In 2016, for in-
stance, a new tool was trialed by our CIP team in the Group produc-
tion system at SEAT Componentes at El Prat in Spain. The CIP team 
focuses on eliminating waste in processes. Everything takes place 
on the shop floor, from organizing workstations and standardizing 
workflows through to detecting non-conformances and resolving 
problems. A wide range of the Group’s production system methodol-
ogy modules are used as part of the CIP team’s feedback loop. 
Our ideas management program is another important tool for 
encouraging employee engagement. This program enables employ-
ees to bring their creativity, knowledge and initiative to bear and 
take responsibility for improving both processes and products. Over 
580,000 ideas were submitted in 2016, saving the company approxi-
mately €435 million. Ideas management is an important leadership 
and motivational tool for plant supervisors and managers. It also 
contributes to improving health and safety in the Volkswagen 
workplace and helps us reach our targets for reducing energy and 
water consumption, waste, solvents and CO2 emissions.

COMMITMENT TO SOCIETY
Volkswagen can look back on a long tradition of engagement with 
society, not least at international level. As well as supporting local  
development, educational and social welfare projects at numer-
ous sites, in many regions we act as an economic driver, helping to 
strengthen education, culture and civil society, as well as promote 
sustainable development in the form of infrastructure development. 
Over the reporting year, we were involved in around 200 projects 
around the globe designed to enhance economic and social structures. 
We also provide emergency assistance on an ad-hoc basis, following 
natural disasters for example. With our commitment to these causes 
and the partnerships into which we enter with local political and civil 
society stakeholders, we underscore the importance of the United 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in our daily operations. 
One example of corporate regional responsibility in practice is Wolfs-
burg AG, a public-private partnership between Volkswagen AG and 
the city of Wolfsburg. As well as supporting start-ups and businesses 
seeking to relocate to this city where the Group is headquartered, the 
organization works with numerous partners to jointly create knowl-
edge networks and provide funding for academic and community 
facilities. The main focus is on education, energy, health, recreation 
and, of course, mobility – traditionally one of Wolfsburg’s strongest 
areas of expertise. In cooperation with the regional development 
organization Allianz für die Region GmbH, Wolfsburg AG is devising 
forward-looking solutions for improving job prospects and quality of 
life across the whole of southeastern lower Saxony.
Charitable donations constitute a further cornerstone of the Group’s 
long-term engagement with society. We support a wide range of so-
cial initiatives and charitable projects around the world. The principles 
governing donations and sponsorships are set out in our Group-wide 
Code of Conduct, which stipulates we may give donations in cash and 
in kind to support activities and projects primarily devoted to research 
and education, culture, sports and social causes. Donations may only 
be given to recognized non-profit organizations or ones specifically 
endorsed to receive donations. Volkswagen does not donate to polit-
ical parties, party-affiliated foundations or individual politicians. In 
the reporting period, Volkswagen AG made donations amounting to 
€33.2 million.
Added to this amount are the donations made by our employees, 
which go to help support people in need in the vicinity of Volkswagen 
AG’s various locations. In 2016, Wolfsburg employees alone donated 
more than €450,000. One beneficiary, for example, was the local 
“Wolfsburger für Wolfsburg” non-profit association. Among other 
things, the association funds nature experience days for children  
and adolescents receiving treatment on the “Rainbow” psychosomatic 
ward of the Wolfsburg pediatrics clinic.
In the “One Hour for the Future” campaign, Volkswagen and Audi 
employees donate one hour’s pay to help street children, raising 
substantial amounts for those in need. Since the summer of 2003, 
this initiative has also included the collection of “spare cents”, where 
Volkswagen AG employees in Germany and abroad donate the odd 
cents on their monthly pay slips to this campaign as well. The funds 
raised are used to support a total of 140 projects in seven countries 
around the world.
Another workforce initiative led to the sale of sustainably produced 
fair-trade products in the company’s cafes and restaurants, where the 
sale of products bearing the Fairtrade seal has been promoted since 
1999. Through this commitment, Volkswagen is helping producers 
in developing countries establish socially sustainable businesses. In 
2016, our annual consumption of fairly traded coffee rose by 30% to 
103 t, and a fairly traded orange juice was added to the menu. Since 
2014, three varieties of fairly traded rice have also been served in 
Volkswagen eateries.
The Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation, established in 2011, is play-
ing an increasingly significant role in terms of our social engagement. 
This charitable foundation aims to support youth outreach as well as 
education and vocational training at all levels, with a particular em-
phasis on improving the living conditions of children and adolescents, 
irrespective of their origin, background or religion. The Foundation 
focuses its activities on the neighborhoods of Group sites worldwide, 
implementing projects in partnership with children’s charity terre des 
hommes. Since 2011, the Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation has 
launched or supported more than 20 projects in Germany and else-
where. For instance, the Foundation contributed to the construction 
of the children’s refuge in Neindorf near Wolfsburg and the conver-
sion of the “Alte Schule” annex into a versatile learning and activity 
center. This center assists with the holistic care of children in need of 
psychomotricity and experiential learning support. The Foundation’s 
partner for this project is the Diaconate of Wolfsburg, which runs 
the only children’s refuge within a 100-km radius. The Volkswagen 
Employees’ Foundation also supports two projects run by the city of 
Wolfsburg which aim to help refugees integrate into society. Both

22. The “Alphabetisierungsgruppen” literacy project offers language 
learning courses with parental involvement. The city of Wolfsburg 
runs “Step by Step”, a three-month intensive integration program for 
refugee children designed to make it easier for them to integrate into 
mainstream education in Germany.
Alongside these projects, which are directly supported by Volkswagen  
or the Volkswagen Works Council, we also encourage our employees 
to volunteer for local causes in their free time. To coordinate and 
provide targeted support for volunteering activities, the “Volkswagen 
pro Ehrenamt” initiative (Volkswagen Supports Volunteering) is an 
integral part of personnel management. Employees who wish to 
do voluntary work can contact the volunteering office, who then use 
their database to identify a suitable project for them to support in 
the future. Since 2007, around 2,600 volunteers have been matched 
to suitable vacancies through this volunteer exchange.
Volkswagen employees who are looking for a new challenge fol-
lowing retirement can register with our in-house “Senior Experts” 
team. This offers them the opportunity to contribute their expertise 
regionally or globally either within the company or by volunteering 
with external organizations. In 2016, around 135 Senior Experts 
took part in projects of their choosing, putting their specialist 
knowledge to good use and contributing to a valuable intergener-
ational exchange of experience. During the reporting year, 28 de-
partments and more than 20 Volkswagen sites worldwide benefited 
from the program.
SYSTEMATIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
As well as commitment, we place an equally strong emphasis on 
developing employees’ skills. Volkswagen has a highly sophisti-
cated education and training system which enjoys close ties with 
public educational establishments such as vocational schools and 
universities all over the world. At Volkswagen, enabling employees 
to acquire further qualifications is organized around occupational 
families (“Berufsfamilien”). Employees who require similar skills to 
perform their jobs and who possess the associated competencies are 
said to belong to an occupational family. The general and technical 
competencies required for each specific activity are defined in skills 
profiles. Employees are offered a wide range of opportunities to gain 
further qualifications, allowing them to continually update their 
skills and deepen their knowledge throughout their working lives. 
In the process, they also learn from more experienced colleagues 
who act as experts and pass on their know-how in our occupational 
family academies. 
We are systematically expanding our network of academies for 
occupational families. During the reporting period, the Governance 
Academy was established, along with the Academy of Technical 
Development, as stipulated in the pact for the future agreed with 
the Works Council. Employees in the new model line organization 
will be served by the existing Product Academy. From 2017 onward, 
irrespective of brand or where an employee is based, skills develop-
ment and training for all occupational families at Volkswagen will 
delivered by one of the 15 academies.
DUAL MODEL OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION  
AND TRAINING
The dual model of vocational education and training, where theory 
and practice are closely intertwined, creates the foundations for 
acquiring the advanced skills, high quality standards and excellent 
performance that the Volkswagen Group demands. Here, too, the 
content of the training is very much geared to the skills required in 
the various occupational families. Volkswagen has rolled out this 
dual model at many of its locations outside Germany as well, and is 
continuing to embed the model as the core framework for acquir-
ing skilled worker qualifications. For instance, in 2016 a group of 
apprentices at Volkswagen do Brasil were the first intake to graduate 
as mechatronics engineers by passing an examination set by the 
German Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When planning new 
plants, dual vocational training is taken into account from the outset. 
Accordingly, more than three-quarters of all trainees in the Group 
learn their trade through the dual system. 
As at the end of 2016, the Volkswagen Group had trained 19,490 young 
people in some 60 recognized occupations on 50 dual-study courses. 
We also support the career development of new entrants once they 
have completed their apprenticeship. Particularly talented young 
skilled workers are supported through “talent groups”. This two-year 
training and development program recruits the best 10% of appren-
tices from each year’s intake at Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen 
Sachsen GmbH in zwickau. 102 skilled workers joined the program 
during the reporting year, taking the total to 851 young men and 
women since the initiative was launched in 2008. 
On completion of an apprenticeship, the “Wanderjahre” (year abroad) 
program offers young people the opportunity to spend 12 months 
working for a Group company abroad. During the year under review, 
15 Volkswagen Group sites in 13 countries took part in this develop-
ment program, including – for the first time – Volkswagen Truck & 
Bus as well as MAN Truck & Bus Germany. In 2016, 33 participants 
from Germany plus nine from four other countries began their year 
abroad within the Volkswagen Group. 
Once a year, Volkswagen honors its highest-achieving trainees across 
the Group with the “Best Apprentice Award”. In 2016, nine young 
women and 36 young men from a total of 43 Group locations 
received this award for their outstanding performance and technical 
expertise.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR GRADUATES
Volkswagen recruits and fosters academic talent through two 
programs: the Student Talent Bank and the Academic Talent Pool. 
Student Talent Bank fosters high-achieving students in both work- 
related and interdisciplinary areas. The aim here is to encourage 
former interns to join the company and give them the best possible 
preparation for embarking on a career at Volkswagen. Shortly  
before they complete their degree or doctorate, students showing  
high potential are transferred into the Academic Talent Pool. 
This program enables talented young students who have already 
demonstrated their abilities through an internship, dissertation  
or PhD at Volkswagen to raise their profile within the company, 
boosting their chances of starting a career in their chosen specialist 
field.
Volkswagen also offers two structured entry and development pro-
grams for university graduates and young professionals. In addition 
to working in their own field, trainees in the StartUp Direct program 
attend additional training courses and obtain a good overview of the 
company over a two-year period. University graduates interested in 
working internationally can take part in the 18-month StartUp Cross 
program. This enables them to get to know Volkswagen as a whole 
and start to network extensively. Through postings in a variety of 
specialist areas during this period, participants get to know the Volk-
swagen Passenger Cars brand and gain experience at its various sites 
at home and abroad. Both programs also require trainees to spend 
several weeks in production. Volkswagen took on 114 trainees under 
the two programs in 2016, of whom around 26% were women. 
Trainee programs are also offered at international Group locations 
such as at ŠKODA in Czechia and Scania in Sweden. In addition, since 
2012 the Volkswagen Group’s StartUp Europe trainee program has 
offered young engineers from southern Europe – where unemploy-
ment continues to be a major issue for young academics in partic-
ular – an opportunity to gain international work experience. This 
Volkswagen program is designed to attract university graduates from 
Italy, Spain and Portugal. Three months at a brand or subsidiary in 
their home country are followed by 21 months at a Group company 
in Germany.
EXTENSIVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES  
FOR SPECIALISTS AND EXECUTIVES
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, skilled specialists can choose 
from a broad range of advanced training courses – from further 
training in occupational or cross-disciplinary areas of general interest 
to the Company, to specific qualifications in the occupational fam-
ilies, through to comprehensive personal development programs. 
Here, too, the focus is on the dual-study model which combines 
theory with practical experience. Overall, around 106,000 qualifica-
tion activities totaling 13.3 million hours of training were completed 
across the Group in 2016. Over 590 training courses and programs 
were newly developed for the Volkswagen brand alone.
We have standardized many of the development programs and 
selection procedures for executives, managers and group leaders 
across the Group. During the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group 
Academy ran some 615 training programs and assessment centers 
for executives, managers and group leaders in 15 countries.
ACADEMIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
As part of the Volkswagen Group Academy, AutoUni employs top in-
house experts and collaborates with higher-education institutions 
to furnish the company with leading-edge knowledge for the future. 
Its programs and collaborative study models use a blended learn-
ing format which combines face-to-face classroom teaching with 
online content, supplemented by lectures and conferences. Subjects 
covered in 2016 included digital transformation, sustainability, e mo-
bility, driverless cars, Industry 4.0, and the workplace of the future. 
Around 9,200 people from 59 locations worldwide took part in over 
160 AutoUni events.
AutoUni cooperates with internationally renowned universities, in-
stitutes and research centers on numerous research projects, disser-
tations and theses, and offers PhD students in the Group a platform 
for exchanging ideas and gaining interdisciplinary qualifications. As 
at the end of 2016, more than 400 PhD students were engaged in 
researching topics of future interest to Volkswagen’s various Group 
companies in Germany. 
In addition, AutoUni facilitates networking between the internal 
contacts for universities within the Group and keeps track of links 
to universities around the globe: during the year under review, over 
1,700 national and international cooperation agreements with 
universities, research institutes and universities of applied sciences 
were in place.

IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION ON TRAINING
New technologies can usefully complement traditional modes of 
learning and skills transfer. As the core training provider for the 
Group, the Volkswagen Group Academy is consequently incorpo-
rating these technologies in various projects. The digitalxperience 
program is exploring ways of using digital technology to enhance 
the content and learning formats of dual-track vocational training 
as part of gearing up for the future. These measures are flanked 
by systematic skills development among the teaching staff at the 
Volkswagen Group Academy. 
Audi AG is employing tablets as a complementary mobile learning 
platform for vocational training in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm as well 
as in its Brussels and Györ training centers. Trainers are also being 
instructed in how to work with tablet PCs. In 2016, ŠKODA launched 
virtual classrooms and online language courses for German and 
English. 
As part of the corporate learning and digital learning initiatives, 
AutoUni and the Volkswagen Group Academy’s Group-wide training 
networks are also making increased use of digital technology to 
develop new training programs. At the same time, the Volkswagen 
Group Academy is setting up an Education lab designed to create 
stronger ties with education start-ups and translate the findings of 
educational research into new technologies. These will then be tested 
in collaboration with the teaching staff and students at Volkswagen 
to aid learning and skills transfer.
All these measures are aimed at maintaining and enhancing the 
high standard of skills and the outstanding expertise of Volkswagen 
employees all over the world. Above all, we are committed to deliv-
ering learning and teaching within the framework of occupational 
families, by following the dual vocational training model where 
theory and practice are closely intertwined. Systematic knowledge 
transfer by in-house experts at all levels and across all brands and 
specialist fields is another key factor underpinning our success.
HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL PROVISION
Our efforts to ensure that our employees have well-developed skills 
and a high level of commitment address the first two facets of our 
strategic objective to cultivate “skilled and committed employees”. 
However, alongside a willingness to perform (through participation) 
and empowerment to perform (through having the right qualifi-
cations), there is a third facet, namely capability. This requires our 
workforce to be physically and mentally capable of coping with the 
stresses and strains that any form of work involves. 
Consequently, we do not simply regard the protection and promo-
tion of our employees’ health as a self-evident social obligation 
and reflection of our corporate culture, but also as an integral part 
of our human resources strategy. Volkswagen’s holistic approach 
to health management goes well beyond traditional preventive 
healthcare and occupational safety; it also includes aspects such as 
work organization, ergonomics, prevention, integration and rehabil-
itation, along with leadership styles.
As well as complying with Group guidelines on protecting and 
promoting health, the medical and healthcare services we provide 
for our employees are in line with the relevant statutory require-
ments and internal regulations at each site. All sites have at least 
emergency health provision, while most also offer medical services 
under the oversight of a physician.
In the context of health, sustainability means ensuring that, ideally, 
every employee is still healthy when they retire. Protecting and 
promoting employees’ health is a priority for the company, shared 
by both management and employee representatives. Under the 
auspices of our TOGETHER 2025 strategy process, we have launched 
our own Group health initiative. Over the coming years, we will fur-
ther develop and implement innovative approaches to prevention, 
workplace health management and ergonomics throughout the 
Group. The aims of the health initiative are clearly defined: to im-
prove employees’ quality of life, reduce stress, avoid chronic illness 
and consequently also boost performance and reduce absences. 
IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the 
continuous improvement of occupational safety is vitally import-
ant to us. As long ago as 2004, the Volkswagen Group drew up an 
occupational safety policy which is binding on all Group compa-
nies around the globe. The same standards of work organization, 
occupational safety and healthcare apply to all our employees 
worldwide, taking into account local medical infrastructures and the 
relevant statutory requirements in each case. Group-wide audits are  
conducted to ensure compliance with these worldwide standards. 
For this purpose, in 2010 the Group launched its own occupational 
safety management system (KAMS). This system is used to analyze 
the organizational structures and processes for occupational safety 
at all participating Group companies. The findings are held in a 
central database with Group-wide access. To improve the sharing of 
information, in recent years the exchange of reports on serious and 
fatal accidents within the Group has been harmonized. As a result, 
VOLKSWAGEN KONZERN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016
64
pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: SKIllED AND COMMITTED EMPlOyEES 
all sites can take specific action to prevent such accidents in the 
future. Since 2012, Volkswagen in Germany has also been running 
mandatory occupational safety training modules for all prospective 
managers. Similarly, the group leader qualification modules have 
also been standardized and now form a mandatory part of basic 
group leader training.
WORKPLACE ERGONOMICS
The Group continues to attach a high priority to improving work-
place ergonomics. Its focus in 2016 was on firmly anchoring  
ergonomics in the 2025 production strategy, in particular by lever-
aging ergonomics and synergies across all our brands. A number  
of projects were implemented in the reporting period:
 § Together with Technical Development, Quality Assurance, Planning, 
Industrial Engineering and Production units, in 2016 a standard 
process for reducing the effort required to record and analyze force 
measurements and for designing workstations was developed and 
agreed. 
 § The drafting and approval of the Ergonomics White Paper provid-
ed the basis for planning workstations in production and logistics, 
with the aim of reducing the physical strain associated with the 
high-speed, value-adding production methods geared to matching 
customer demand. 
 § In the future, cross-brand guidelines for ergonomic assessments in 
logistics will enable transparent, reproducible workload analyses 
for logistical activities. 
 §  At Volkswagen-branded locations – currently as part of a pilot 
project – a workplace management system is being used to match 
workplace demands to individual employees’ physical capacity. As 
a result, employees can be deployed in jobs that optimally reflect 
their capabilities. 
 §  Since june 2016, humans and robots have been working hand in 
hand at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg plant, and the first human-robot 
collaboration (HRC) initiative has now been deployed on the Golf 
production line. In the drive preassembly section, where individual 
powertrain components are assembled to produce an engine ready 
for installation, employees are assisted by a robot. Collaborative 
robots have already been deployed in other Group plants as well.
At the same time, for several years Volkswagen has been making 
improvements throughout the product development process with 
the aim of ensuring that the quality of jobs and the physical de-
mands placed on employees by production processes are taken into 
consideration from the earliest planning and design stages of new 
vehicle models. 
This involves leveraging both research and practical experience to 
combine state-of-the-art ergonomic workstations with innovative 
work processes. “Ergo assistants” on production lines give employees 
advice and guidance directly at their workstations on how they can 
optimize workflows from an ergonomic standpoint.

PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE
Ergonomics in factories and offices is one side of the occupational 
health equation; individual preventive measures are the other. The 
Volkswagen Checkup – a free, comprehensive health screening 
program for all employees – is now established at all German sites 
and helps employees stay fit and healthy and maintain their per-
formance. Employees appreciate the high-quality diagnostics and 
follow-up preventive healthcare and exercise programs.
REHABILITATION MEASURES
At many sites, we offer a tailored rehabilitation program to reinte-
grate employees following serious or long-term illness, providing 
specific job-related support at an early stage. The aim is to restore 
an employee’s ability to work within three to at most six months.
At Volkswagen AG, the program may also include specially tailored 
services, depending on the particular needs in each case. Examples  
This checkup has now been rolled out to almost all international 
sites. Other preventive healthcare programs have been brought into 
line with Group-wide standards. In many cases, country-specific 
supplementary examinations, such as HIV and tuberculosis tests, 
have been added.
are “jobReha” which offers one to three weeks of outpatient, day- 
patient or inpatient treatment, mainly for musculoskeletal prob-
lems, and the “RehaFit” program, which focuses on orthopedic or 
psychological rehabilitation. Other examples include physiotherapy 
and general or targeted stamina-building exercises at workplace 
fitness centers. Support and counseling services for employees with 
mental health or psychosomatic problems are also being steadily 
expanded.

SOCIAL PROVISION IN THE WORKPLACE
If an employee falls ill, our involvement is not solely limited to pro-
viding assistance of a medical nature, however. Volkswagen AG also 
supplements benefits paid by social insurance providers, for example 
sick pay, and provides support to relatives of employees who die. 
The company also has a collective accident insurance scheme which 
insures employees for accidents resulting in death or disability. In 
exceptional circumstances of financial need, Volkswagen AG can also 
provide employees with short-term loans.

pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: WORK ORGANIzATION FIT FOR THE FUTURE
Strategic Objective: 
Work Organization Fit for the Future
A job’s attractiveness depends first and foremost on the workplace 
itself. Accordingly, we endeavor to provide an innovative working en-
vironment in our plants and offices which allows individuals to fulfill 
their potential. This includes introducing new approaches such as 
Scrum and design thinking in knowledge work, as well as innovative 
practices on the shop floor, for instance by systematically designing 
technology around the workforce. In addition, we offer working time 
models tailored to individual workers’ requirements and specific 
programs for employees with special needs, as in these cases in 
particular, customized forms of work organization can significantly 
boost performance and job satisfaction levels. 
For instance, Volkswagen AG’s Work2Work program has been creat-
ing new career opportunities for performance-impaired employees 
since 2001. An employee’s current potential is matched to work-
place requirements so that despite performance impairments, the 
individual is nevertheless still able to make a significant contribution 
to value creation. Almost 2,000 employees have benefited from this 
program in recent years, and 541 people are currently employed in 
Work2Work jobs in Wolfsburg across some 100 different activities. 
In 2016, the proportion of severely disabled people in Volkswagen 
AG’s total workforce came to 7.74%, considerably more than the 
statutory quota of 5%. The fact that approximately 55% of these 
severely disabled employees work in production demonstrates that 
we have plenty of experience in providing special workstations for 
EXPANDING BARRIER-FREE ACCESS
Creating the workplaces of the future also means making them 
barrier-free. This includes ensuring that all employees, regardless 
of any impairment, can access and use all buildings, information 
and communication facilities without assistance. To make it easier 
for all our employees to find barrier-free parking spaces, cafés, 
canteens, self-service shops, elevators and first-aid stations in our 
INNOVATIVE WORKING TIME MODELS
Flexible working time plays a significant role in innovative work 
organization models. Volkswagen is continuously working to further 
enhance the ability of its employees to combine work and family 
life. In September 2016, Volkswagen AG introduced a far-reaching 
company agreement governing mobile working, i.e. work away from 
the usual workplace. Since October 2016, workers at Audi AG have 
been entitled to flexible working arrangements in terms of location 
and time, provided this is feasible for the particular job in question. 
These agreements are satisfying the wishes of many employees for 
more flexibility in choosing where and when they work.
plants, we have drawn up an “accessibility map” which is updated 
on an ongoing basis. We are also constantly increasing the number 
of barrier-free workstations and training facilities, as well as our 
barrier-free processes. In 2015, we rolled out an accessible online 
application process for our vocational training programs; this was 
further expanded in 2016.
Volkswagen AG is extremely flexible in its undertaking to re-employ  
workers who take extended leave: for the past 20 years or so, em-
ployees have been able to take up to eight years’ leave of absence 
without having to give a reason. Regardless of whether this leave is 
used as a sabbatical, for parental leave or career development pur-
poses, employees have a guaranteed right to re-employment on the 
same terms and conditions as before. Both Audi and Porsche also 
have arrangements for sabbaticals in place. At Audi, this is governed 
by the company agreement on sabbaticals drawn up in 2009, while 
at Porsche, it is governed by the 2014 company agreement on volun-
people with performance impairments. We are also committed to 
employees with disabilities in other countries too. For instance, 
over 200 people with disabilities work in six sheltered workshops 
at  ŠKODA production plants in Czechia. We also support jobs for 
severely disabled people by awarding contracts to workshops for 
people with disabilities. Orders worth over €19.5 million were placed 
in 2016.

tary personal leave. This sabbatical model comprises a work phase 
and an unpaid leave phase. The minimum duration of the unpaid 
leave period is two months, and the maximum is twelve months.
We also offer a wide range of options for taking a leave of absence  
to care for close family members. Employees are entitled to take up  
to 10 working days of leave at short notice, to make arrangements 
for appropriate care for instance. They may also take up to six 
months part-time or full-time leave to care for a family member. 
Another option is to work part-time for up to 24 months in order 
to meet caring obligations. At Porsche, employees have been able 
to apply for time off to care for family members since 2014. If care 
is urgently required within the family, they can take up to three 
months’ leave.
We believe these measures greatly contribute to the present and 
future attractiveness of work at Volkswagen, consequently also 
ensuring the company remains competitive. 
Strategic Objective: Exemplary 
Leadership and Corporate Culture
In the wake of the diesel crisis, as part of the Group’s TOGETHER 
2025 strategy, the Volkswagen Group began a process of radical 
transformation from the ground up. This includes ideas and initia-
tives for revitalizing our corporate culture. In 2016, for instance,  
we formulated new Group-wide management principles and re-
viewed the criteria for appointments to management positions. One 
important new policy introduced in 2016 was the Code of Collabo-
ration, which anchors our interactions within the Group in a clearly 
defined set of values. As the code defines the principles for trust-
based collaboration within the Group, it also constitutes a key pillar 
of our strategy. It describes how employees should cooperate within 
the brand network and uses terms such as “open and honest”, “un-
complicated”, “without prejudice”, “on an equal footing” and “for 
one another”.
Beneath the umbrella of the overarching Group strategy, the Group 
brands are establishing their own brand strategies and defining 
their own corporate values based on the Code of Collaboration. For 
instance, the new corporate values of the Volkswagen brand are 
“together”, “courageous”, “customer-focused”, “efficient”, “open 
and honest” and “attentive”. These were announced in November 
2016 following intensive, international consultations. Thousands 
of Volkswagen employees contributed to the formulation of these 
values in a wide variety of ways. 2017 will see campaigns to raise 
awareness of these values, as well as embed them in HR processes 
and corporate structures.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS LEVERS OF CHANGE
As part of the drive to revitalize our corporate culture, our efforts 
in 2016 were focused above all on implementing diversity man-
agement. This was not simply a response triggered by the fallout 
from the diesel crisis, but represents a radical modernization of our 
corporate culture. Different cultural circumstances in global markets 
and an increasingly dynamic economic situation demand from us an 
ever more broad-based array of experiences, world views, problem 
solutions and ideas for products. The diversity of our workforce 
offers us potential for innovation which we are seeking to leverage 
more effectively in the future. 
As part of our commitment to the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals, we champion diversity and equal opportunities 
at all our locations around the world. Our position is crystal clear: 
Volkswagen stands for respect, tolerance and cultural openness. We 
guarantee equal opportunities and equal treatment irrespective of 
ethnicity, race, gender, disability, ideology, faith, nationality, sexual 
orientation, social background or political conviction, provided the 
latter is based on democratic principles and tolerance toward those 
who hold different views. The Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct, 
which was jointly agreed with our social partners in the Social 
Charter in 2002, underpins these aspirations throughout the Group. 
Under the code, every employee and member of an executive board  
is responsible for ensuring that colleagues work together in partner-
ship and is obliged to report any breaches immediately.

If any employee feels they are being discriminated against, in 
addition to their statutory right to lodge a complaint, they may also 
contact trained staff for advice and support. At the initiative of the 
Works Council, employees’ obligations and their rights to non-dis-
crimination were laid down in 1996 in the “Cooperative Conduct at 
the Workplace” company agreement applicable to all Volkswagen 
AG employees at all its sites. The agreement also covers bullying and 
other forms of discrimination. Every new employee receives a copy 
of it when they join the company. The subject of discrimination is 
also covered in management training courses. A separate brochure 
describing the benefits of colleagues working together in a collabo-
rative way aims to raise awareness of and prevent discrimination. It 
includes information on how employees themselves can take action 
if they perceive discrimination, what advice is available, and the 
processes when making a complaint.
VOLKSWAGEN SHOWS RACISM  
THE RED CARD
The Volkswagen Group is supporting “International Weeks 
against Racism”, a United Nations initiative. Volkswagen 
organized a large number of related events between 
March 13 and March 26, 2017, sending out a clear signal 
against discrimination and xenophobia. Across the Group, 
hundreds of employees of Group brands, subsidiaries and 
global facilities took part in a worldwide photo campaign, 
posting up selfies in support of the cause. CEO Matthias 
Müller led by example, calling for a clear stance opposing 
racism: “If you stay silent for too long, you shouldn’t be 
surprised if things that seemed set in stone just yesterday 
start to fall apart,” he said, as he explained the Group’s 
commitment. At the same time, he underscored the 
importance of intercultural, international tolerance for the 
Volkswagen Group: “Our diversity is part of Volkswagen’s 
DNA. True collaboration in intercultural, multiethnic teams 
around the world – whether in offices or on the factory 
floor – is based on respect and tolerance,” said Müller. He 
stressed that Volkswagen has as little patience for racism 
as for any other form of discrimination at work. “We have 
a clear code of conduct and impose heavy penalties for 
violations – up to and including dismissal!”
VOLKSWAGEN IN URUMQI – 
INTEGRATION AND INCLUSION IN PRACTICE
xinjiang, the largest province (in terms of area) in the far 
west of China, is regularly troubled by unrest among the 
Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group. Since 2013, Volkswa-
gen and the Group’s Chinese joint-venture partner have 
been running a production facility in the province, in the 
city of Urumqi. Volkswagen is countering the unstable 
political situation in the region by actively assuming social 
responsibility. A quarter of the workforce is currently com-
posed of members of ethnic minorities, of whom half are 
men and women from the original Uyghur population; so 
proportionally, the composition of the workforce reflects 
the ethnic profile of the greater Urumqi area. In addition, 
Volkswagen has set up a dedicated staff canteen at the 
plant that serves dishes prepared exclusively according to 
Islamic dietary requirements.
Volkswagen’s pioneering work in this area is bolstered by a 
wide range of CSR projects supporting all parts of the pop-
ulation of Urumqi and xinjiang Province. The full scope of 
these CSR activities includes environmental protection, 
education and research, healthcare, culture, sport and the 
advancement of women.

ADVANCING WOMEN AND COMBINING  
WORK AND FAMILY
As part of our diversity agenda, we continue to attach great im-
portance to advancing the careers of women in the workforce. As 
a voluntary undertaking, the Group first proposed differentiated 
targets for the proportion of female employees in the workforce 
back in 2011. The following principle applies: we recruit the best 
graduates from each year in the required disciplines, taking as our 
starting point the proportion of female graduates on each course. 
When all the courses relevant to Volkswagen are averaged out, 
these differentiated quotas produce a recruitment target for female 
graduates of 30%.
Bringing more qualified women into the company will enable us to 
steadily increase the percentage of women in senior positions over 
the coming years. Volkswagen AG has set the following targets for 
increasing the proportion of women in management: 
 § by the end of 2021, 13.0% of employees at the first level  
of management should be female 
 § and by the same deadline, women should make up 16.9%  
of employees at the second level.
For senior positions at the brands and companies in Germany where 
equal treatment is prescribed by law, the Volkswagen Group is aim-
ing for 14.3% of managers at all levels to be female by 2021. In order 
to support the career development of female talent in the company, 
in the course of 2017, all companies with a headcount of over 1,000 
will define targets for appointing women to management positions. 
On this basis, at the beginning of 2018 we will then specify a new 
broader target for the Volkswagen Group worldwide. 
In 2016, the proportion of women in management in the Volkswagen  
Group in Germany (excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche) was 11.0%, 
up from 10.3% the year before.
We are taking a variety of measures to encourage this trend. For 
instance, 2016 saw the third cohort embark on the cross-brand man-
agement mentoring program, with 43 women from the Volkswagen 
Group in Germany participating. In addition, Volkswagen offers the 
“Kompass” program specifically to encourage female talent to aim 
for a career in management. Over the reporting period, 60 women 
from Volkswagen AG, MAN, Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, Volkswagen 
Osnabrück, Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Autovision GmbH 
took part in this program. There is a key difference between the 
objectives of the two programs: while “Kompass” prepares women 
for potential leadership roles at Volkswagen, the mentoring program 
is aimed at women in the talent pipeline who have already been 
identified as potential high flyers.
Volkswagen aims to attract female students at an early stage. Our 
Germany-wide “Woman DrivING Award” and “Woman Experience 
Day” both target female engineering and IT students and graduates, 
aiming to interest them in technical careers with us.
With its “Sie und Audi” (Audi and you) program, Audi AG has been 
supporting the career development of talented female high-achiev-
ers in all fields and at all levels for a number of years. The program 
focuses on different target groups and include, for example, a 
mentoring program for female talent as well as various seminars 
and networking opportunities. In addition, Volkswagen is aiming to 
increase the proportion of female skilled workers and group leaders 
in Germany to 10%. In the 2016 fiscal year, the percentage of female 
skilled workers in the Volkswagen Group in Germany (excluding 
Scania, MAN and Porsche) was 7.6%, and 5.1% for group leaders.
In order to increase the proportion of female trainees in industrial 
and technical trades from 23.3% in 2016 to 30% in 2021, Volkswagen 
is specifically seeking to attract female talent, for example by arrang-
ing special work experience and orientation days for young women. 
The aim of these events is to give young women a taste of training 
in these technical occupations and help them make career choices. 
For many years, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, MAN and Volkswagen Financial  
Services brands have participated in the Germany-wide “Girls’ Day” 
or “Day of the Future” event. During the reporting year, the “Girls’ 
Day” format offered over 2,000 female school students a practical 
insight into the industrial/technical careers offered in the auto-
motive sector. During its “Technical Day”, ŠKODA gave 250 female 
school students the opportunity to try out occupations in science 
and technology by taking part in practical exercises.

pEopLE    STRATEGIC OBjECTIVE: FIRST-RATE HR ORGANIzATION
As well as attracting and fostering female talent, Volkswagen is con-
tinually striving to improve employees’ ability to combine work and 
family life. To us, a family-oriented human resources policy is one of 
the key qualities of an attractive employer. 
The Group offers many different arrangements to enable individuals 
to juggle the demands of work and home. These include flexible 
part-time working and shift patterns, or teleworking and mobile 
working at Volkswagen and Audi, as well as working for Porsche 
from a home office. All brands also run programs to ensure a smooth 
return to work after a period of parental leave. “Careers and kids” is 
a new initiative at Volkswagen which supports young mothers and 
fathers during their parental leave and helps them find the best way 
of picking up their careers again following their return to work.
Another step on the way to becoming a family-friendly enterprise 
is our ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provision. Both in 
Germany and other countries, the Volkswagen Group has found 
childcare facilities in the vicinity of the company to be beneficial. 
In addition to well-established existing facilities, such as those at 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG or run by the Volkswagen Group 
of America in Chattanooga, in recent years we have set up a number 
of daycare centers near our operating locations. We also intend to 
expand childcare provision at other sites along the lines of the con-
cepts used at the Volkswagen plants in Hanover and Emden, which 
were set up in collaboration with the respective local authorities. 
All German sites of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and MAN brands offer childcare 
during school holidays. And the range of childcare provision outside 
Germany is also expanding, with children’s holiday camps at, for 
example, Volkswagen plants in Shanghai, Navarra, Chattanooga and 
Kaluga. 
With these wide-ranging measures, we are confident that we are 
making a real contribution, not only to more diversity, but also  
to a culture of openness and inclusion across all our brands and com-
panies. 
Strategic Objective: 
First-Rate HR Organization
All the objectives and various activities described require a solid 
foundation. As passionate HR people, we are convinced that only 
strong personnel management focused on the interests of both  
the company and its employees can provide the basis for good work 
policies in an environmentally and socially responsible enterprise.
Highly competent and qualified HR staff are crucial for implement-
ing human resources policies that motivate people to perform their 
best. Accordingly, our fifth strategic objective is to continuously 
improve our HR organization. This goal that we have set ourselves  
is ambitious – HR will shape and support all upcoming change  
and transformation processes in the company, without ever losing 
sight of the objective of creating highly productive, people-friendly 
working environments. To attain this vision, we are currently improv-
ing the organization of personnel management. Our future efforts 
will center firstly, on the digital transformation of work processes, 
and secondly, on refocusing personnel management.
The “We empower to perform” human resources strategy will 
formulate our previous personnel management objectives in more 
detail. Not only will we ensure that our top teams have the requi-
site skills; in collaboration with the specialist units, we will work on 
laying the foundations for enabling the teams to develop their full 
potential – among other things by equipping them to continually 
adapt to changing circumstances. The goal is thus to make HR fit for 
the digital age, release energies for cultural change and transforma-
tion, while at the same time contributing to the Group’s competi-
tiveness and sustained economic success. We intend to reinforce our 
strengths while preserving the tried and tested – but also to tackle 
new challenges and shape the working environment of the future. 
So: “Welcome, transformation”!

Helping Refugees: 
Meeting, Educating, Integrating
Since the summer of 2015, the Volkswagen Group has been vigorous 
in its efforts to support the wave of refugees arriving in Germany. 
Together with employees and their representatives, the Group and 
brands have been donating time, expertise and resources. Volkswa-
gen considers that the most urgent priorities for refugees at present 
are to learn German and acquire entry-level qualifications, as these 
are the keys for accessing further education and training and inte-
gration in the labor market. In 2016, approximately 2,650 refugees 
were given access to language and foundation training courses. The 
Volkswagen Group’s commitment to aiding refugees comprises three 
strands, in which the following took place during 2016:
 § Meeting: support for several thousand refugees by means of  
donations, volunteering and get-to-know events. 
 § Educating: grants for 100 refugees, language and integration 
courses for 1,400+ refugees over several months, classes and 
targeted support for integration and skills for work, support for 
minors at school.
 § Integrating: work placements and internships for 340 refugees, 
skill assessment measures and career guidance for over 870 refu-
gees.
MEETING – FROM INITIAL AID TO HELP  
WITH EVERYDAY LIFE
Since the summer of 2015, many Volkswagen employees have given 
their time and know-how to help set up accommodation for and pro-
vide practical assistance to refugees. The company supports this large-
scale voluntary involvement by offering the services of its experts, 
making donations in kind and providing vehicles for aid organizations.
Evolving out of initial efforts to provide immediate aid, the brands and 
their employees have been involved in developing a variety of short 
and long-term social support initiatives. These range from organiz-
ing language courses and participation in sports through to helping 
EDUCATING – FROM LANGUAGE COURSES  
TO HIGHER EDUCATION
At various stages of their educational journey, the Volkswagen 
Group is helping refugees learn the language, obtain qualifications 
and understand German culture. This begins with the very young-
est: the Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation supports children and 
adolescents during three years at school through donations of some 
€2.5 million to fund language learning, integration and the acquisi-
tion of qualifications. 
Across the Group, the Volkswagen and Audi brands offer – directly 
or in cooperation with educational providers – language courses at 
different levels over a number of months. In addition, Audi is enabling 
with everyday life. For instance, MAN initiated a long-term trainee 
sponsorship program for unaccompanied refugee minors. As part of 
this program, the trainees organize opportunities to meet and get to 
know refugees, while refugees get an insight into work at MAN. These 
initiatives are complemented by a variety of projects run by individ-
ual brands which are aimed at encouraging employees and refugees 
to get to know one another and swap experiences. One example of 
this is the “Kitchen Stories” intercultural cooking evenings offered by 
Volkswagen.
two classes to obtain school-leaving certificates. Participants, who  
are over the compulsory schooling age, are helped to acquire a general 
secondary school certificate (“Hauptschulabschluss”) through a com-
bination of general lessons, additional German lessons and socio- 
educational support.
The Volkswagen Group also helps refugees obtain university degrees. 
In cooperation with the charity start-up “Kiron Open Higher Educa-
tion”, university places in IT and engineering are offered. Two years of 
online study combined with a classroom phase at a German university 
lead to a Bachelor’s degree.

INTEGRATING – FROM PLACEMENT  
TO STARTING A CAREER
The aim of initiatives in this area is to help prepare refugees step 
by step for entering the German education system and labor  
market. Through placements and internships at a number of differ-
ent Volkswagen Group brands, refugees gain an initial insight into 
working life in Germany. 
To get this project off the ground, in 2016 the Volkswagen brand 
ran a pilot refugee work experience program. The program was 
accompanied by workplace training modules covering language, job 
application coaching and intercultural awareness. 
Volkswagen Financial Services runs training courses to help refu-
gees obtain truck drivers’ licenses. In addition, they offer access to 
vocational qualifications that recognize qualifications in financial 
services obtained in refugees’ countries of origin.
In Hanover, as part of a SPRINT language and integration project, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is offering young refugees a 
combination of German lessons and hands-on experience in a work 
environment – the first initiative of its kind in lower Saxony. 
With a combination of vocational subjects, career guidance and 
practical experience, the “integration year” at Porsche prepares 
refugees for apprenticeships or starting work. The first intake of the 
Porsche integration year graduated in August 2016. Most partici-
pants were either able to start an apprenticeship or were taken on 
by the company on a temporary contract basis. At Audi and MAN, 
initiatives to provide refugees with entry-level qualifications have 
also been successfully launched. 
In line with our philosophy of sustainability, the projects described 
will continue throughout 2017 and the range of projects will be 
further expanded. New initiatives to help refugees prepare for work 
and obtain qualifications are set to commence in 2017.

ENVIroNMENT    OUR GOAl: TO MAKE EACH NEW  GENERATION OF VEHIClES MORE  ECO-FRIENDly THAN ITS PREDECESSOR
Environmental management 
The Volkswagen Group has a long tradition of commitment to en-
vironmental protection. Our environmental strategy sets binding, 
measurable targets at every stage of the value chain, aimed at  
further improving environmental protection within the Group. 
Environment
Our goal: to make each new  
generation of vehicles more  
eco-friendly than its predecessor
Climate change, resource availability and urbanization are among the major global challenges facing the Volkswagen 
Group. These challenges are reflected in growing demands from all sides – from politicians enforcing ambitious environ-
mental regulations around the world, from investors who expect us to anticipate and manage the resulting risks, and 
from customers with their growing interest in low-emission, environmentally friendly vehicles. our TOGETHER – Strategy 
2025 aims to make a significant contribution to achieving a reality in which mobility has fewer negative environmen-
tal impacts, and to attaining the united Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). our goal is to become a role 
model for environmental protection. We believe the transformation of our core business is the right way to meet these 
objectives. In coming years, we intend to launch a major electrification initiative and enter new areas of business.
In our quest to become a role model in all things related to the 
 environment, we have drawn up several guidelines:
 § In addition to addressing the global challenge of climate change 
(reducing CO2 emissions), our approach covers all other environ-
mental resources, especially in terms of conserving water, soil 
and air quality as well as energy and raw materials. Our decades 
of experience and the expertise we have built up as a result will 
come to fruition both globally and locally.
 § We employ a holistic approach by researching, developing and 
democratizing environmentally friendly innovations, significantly 
reducing environmental impacts in the process.
 § We significantly reduce environmental impacts throughout the 
entire product life cycle by setting ourselves ambitious goals and 
acting as a driving force in both the production phase (supply 
chain) and use phase of our products.
 § We communicate our measures, achievements and projects as 
transparently as possible.
 § Our achievements are substantiated by top rankings in environ-
mental awards.
THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP’S FUTURE PROGRAM, 
TOGETHER – STRATEGY 2025, REVEALS HOW 
VOLKSWAGEN PLANS TO EXCEL. :
By taking responsibility for environmental issues, we intend 
to become a role model in all things related to the environ-
ment. This sense of responsibility informs all our thoughts 
and actions in equal measure in all the decisions we take. We 
pay particular attention to the emissions and resource utili-
zation of our product portfolio, our locations and our plants. 
With this in mind, we have defined the following targets: 
 § To continuously reduce our carbon footprint
 § To continuously reduce our pollutant emissions
 § To continuously reduce our resource consumption

ENVIroNMENT    ENVIRONMENTAl MANAGEMENT 
Our Group targets state that all newly developed vehicles should 
improve on the environmental performance of predecessor models 
in every respect over the vehicle’s entire life cycle. In production, 
by 2018 we aim to reduce the five key environmental indicators – 
energy and water consumption, waste for disposal, and CO2 and 
VOC emissions – by 25% per manufactured vehicle compared with 
the 2010 baseline. Based on the mean value of these five indicators, 
by 2016 the Group had already succeeded in reducing the environ-
mental impact per unit of production of our passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles by 25.3%.
ORGANIZATION – POLICIES AND GUIDELINES
We can only reach our ambitious targets if environmental issues 
are firmly entrenched in our organizational and decision-making 
processes. Our long-established environmental management system 
provides the basis for this.
All environmental protection activities in the Volkswagen Group are 
centered around our global principles, which have been expanded and 
improved over the years, and which are binding for all Group brands:
As at the end of 2016, in addition to the Group’s environmental 
protection activities, 97 out of our 120 production sites held a valid 
ISO 14001 or EMAS certificate. At our Wolfsburg location, home of 
the Technical Development department, it was decided to temporar-
ily suspend EMAS registration for 2015. In November 2016, following 
a review by environmental auditors, the plant was re-entered on 
the EMAS register. In 2016, the environmental management system 
of the Volkswagen brand’s Technical Development department was 
successfully recertified to the new ISO 14001:2015 standard. The 
key new features of this ISO standard include the introduction of 
the so-called “High-level Structure” (HlS), greater consideration for 
environmental factors, and an integrated approach to competitive 
context based on opportunities and risks.
 § Group Environmental Policy (2010)
 § Group Environmental Principles locations/Production (2007) 
 § Group Environmental Principles Product (2008)
 § Mission Statement on Biodiversity (2008)
All those responsible within the Group, within the brands and at our 
locations are required to comply with these environmental princi-
ples. The environmental policies and targets of the VW Passenger 
Cars/VW Commercial Vehicles, Audi, Bentley, lamborghini, MAN, 
Porsche, Scania, ŠKODA and SEAT brands are likewise derived from 
these principles.
SEAT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT COMPLIES WITH ISO 14006
In 2016, SEAT became the first company in Spain’s automotive sector to be certified under the 
ISO 14006 Ecodesign standard, a certificate which guarantees that the company complies with an 
environmental management system in all its product design and development processes. Awarded 
by the TÜV Rheinland organization, the certificate attests to SEAT’s environmental strategy and the 
ecodesign criteria that now drive the design and development of its entire model line-up. Obtaining 
ISO 14006 Ecodesign certification is an important milestone for the company, in that it helps the 
management system to continuously identify, verify and improve the environmental aspects of its 
design and development processes. The ISO 14006 Ecodesign certificate ensures that any possible 
impact that a product could have on the environment is carefully considered from the time it is first 
conceived, encouraging a preventive approach. It considers the environmental impact of a vehicle 
at each stage in its life cycle, from the development process through to final disposal once it is no 
longer in use.  
Many of the production facilities of the Volkswagen, Audi, ŠKODA, 
SEAT, Bentley, lamborghini, Porsche, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
and MAN brands have had their energy management systems certi-
fied under the ISO 50001 standard.
Since 2009, the “Integration of Environmental Factors into the Volk-
swagen Brand’s Product Development” in the Technical Development 
department of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand has also been 
certified to ISO/TR 14062.

ENVIroNMENT    ENVIRONMENTAl MANAGEMENT 
GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BODIES
The Group Board of Management is the highest decision-making  
authority on environmental matters. Since 2012, it has simultane-
ously functioned as the Group’s Sustainability Board. The CSR and 
Sustainability Steering Committee reports directly to the Sustain-
ability Board on a regular basis, and is made up of representatives 
of Group units, brands and companies. The Group-wide manage-
ment of environmental protection is the responsibility of the Corpo-
rate Environment and Energy Steering Committee, with input from 
numerous specialist bodies such as:
 § the Corporate life Cycle Engineering Working Group
 § the Corporate Resource-efficient Production Working Group
ENGAGING THE WORKFORCE
Only a well-informed, qualified workforce can implement the specific 
measures derived from our Environmental Strategy and achieve the 
set targets. Since 1976, Environmental Officers at our European loca-
tions have regularly convened to share their knowledge and experi-
ence. Regular Group Environmental Conferences were introduced in 
1998 as a forum for the Group’s Environmental Officers and experts 
to discuss strategies, measures and projects, and draw up joint action 
plans. In support of the production process, the Volkswagen brand has 
introduced Environmental Ambassadors (SfU) – employees who have 
been specially trained as environmental experts. Worldwide, more 
than 1,000 ambassadors are now operating as front-line contacts and 
multipliers for production employees. So-called Energy Experts (SfE) 
are also given special advanced training in energy saving. The Wolfs-
burg facility alone has more than 70 SfEs helping their colleagues to 
save energy. Cross-brand, inter-departmental steering committees 
and working groups also operate at both management and expert 
 § the Corporate CO2 Steering Committee
 § the Vehicle Recycling Steering Committee and
 § the Corporate Energy Working Groupe
These committees assess and analyze environmental opportunities 
and risks. To cover the entire value chain (life cycle approach), the 
corresponding Group divisions are represented on the Corporate En-
vironment & Energy Steering Committee. 
The brands and companies are independently responsible for en-
vironmental organization at their own headquarters and locations, 
but base their respective environmental policies on the targets, 
guidelines and principles that apply across the Group.
level. Employee engagement is supported by an intranet portal 
show casing best-practice examples and facilitating direct contact 
with all the relevant specialists. The portal also outlines fundamental 
energy-saving guidelines and tips, including a number generated by 
the central Ideas Management program.
As a further element of organized workforce involvement in meeting 
the Volkswagen Group’s environmental targets, a “Works Agreement 
on Environmental Protection” has been in place at Volkswagen AG 
factories (including the Technical Development department in 
Wolfsburg) since 1995, and was most recently updated in 2013. It 
motivates employees to incorporate environmental protection into 
their everyday work, so that environmental management objectives 
and measures become an integral part of production reality at all 
our factories and across all our development activities.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Volkswagen welcomes the ratification of the Paris Agreement on 
climate change, which aims to limit global warming to less than 2°C 
above pre-industrial levels. Referring to international climate agree-
ments, our CEO Matthias Müller is calling for the automotive industry 
to ensure that all fleet CO2 emissions “are steadily reduced to zero  
by 2050.”
Our most effective lever for reducing our global carbon footprint is to 
optimize CO2 emissions from the vehicle fleet. This estimate is sup-
ported by the Scope 3 GHG Inventory we have been publishing since 
2012, according to which 74% of total CO2 emissions are generated 
during the use phase.
Our powertrain and fuel strategy is therefore crucial in pointing the 
way ahead for CO2-neutral, sustainable mobility. Fundamentally, our 
approach is based on the massive expansion of our expertise in elec-
tric mobility. Furthermore, Volkswagen is intensifying its commitment 
to the development and use of fuels that produce less CO2.
In 2016, we brought nine models with alternative drives to market. 
They included the following battery electric vehicles (BEVs): the new 
VW e-up!, the new VW e-Golf, the new VW Golf GTE and the new  
Audi Q7 e-tron quattro and Audi A3 e-tron. They also included the 
following vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG): the 
new VW Golf TGI and Audi A3 g-tron. This means that in Europe alone 
(as from spring 2017), the Group now offers a total of 21 models 
equipped with all-electric, plug-in hybrid or natural-gas powertrains. 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Our product development process lays the foundations for maxi-
mizing the fuel economy and resource efficiency of our vehicles.
During the 2016 fiscal year, the Volkswagen Group’s research and 
development activities concentrated on expanding our product port-
folio and improving the functionality, quality, safety and environ-
mental compatibility of our products, while simultaneously reducing 
the number of platforms we use. The Volkswagen Group invested 
€11.5 billion in research and development in 2016, much of which 
was spent on efficiency-enhancing technologies. 
A new all-electric e-Crafter concept vehicle was unveiled in 2016 at 
the IAA Commercial Vehicles motor show. The production version of 
the vehicle represents a zero-emission urban delivery vehicle with 
unlimited freight capacity and a range of up to 160 km (100 miles). 
The first vehicles will be delivered to customers in late 2017.
By 2025, the Group is planning to launch more than 30 new all-elec-
tric vehicle models. We will then be in a position to sell two to three 
million all-electric vehicles each year, representing around a quarter of 
our total unit sales.
The Group made a commitment to reducing the CO2 emissions of its 
European new-car fleet to 95 g/km by 2020 at an early stage. We also 
undertake to uphold CO2 specifications in general, including those 
affecting light commercial vehicles.
At the moment the Volkswagen Group offers
 § 36 models <=  95g CO2/km,
 § 100 models <= 100 g CO2/km,
 § 450 models <= 120 g CO2/km and  
 § 596 models <= 130 g CO2/km in Germany
(respectively engine/gearbox variations, corresponding to DAT guide-
line (Q2/2017).
Products 
The automotive industry is on the verge of making the next quantum 
leap in innovation. While fuel-efficient conventional vehicles with 
low CO2 emissions will remain important for the foreseeable future, 
it is digitalization, combined with electric mobility and autonomous 
driving, that will transform our business – with implications that 
many people are not yet aware of. Over the next few years, not only 
will cars undergo a massive transformation as electric vehicles start  
to penetrate the marketplace, mobility itself will become a separate  
product, redefined by customers, new players and traditional auto-
makers. As the basis for new mobility services, the Group has created 
two new business areas: Digitalization and New Mobility Services.
NUMEROUS PATENTS FILED
In the 2016 fiscal year, we filed 6,465 patent applications 
worldwide (compared with 6,244 the previous year) for em-
ployee inventions, more than half of them in Germany. The 
year-on-year increase is primarily attributable to the rising 
number of applications relating to driver assistance systems, 
conventional and alternative powertrains, and lightweight 
construction, once again highlighting the company’s out-
standing capacity for innovation.

The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (excluding 
lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 120 g CO2/km 
over the reporting period. For the purposes of European CO2 legisla-
tion, the lamborghini and Bentley brands each have an independent 
fleet, both of which likewise met their individual targets. In the 
USA, the fleet emissions figure is 162 g CO2/km (Audi/VW calendar 
year; not VW Group of America), in China 153 g CO2/km (VW Group 
(Import) Co, Shanghai Volkswagen, FAW-Volkswagen) – equivalent 
to 6.51 l/100 km – and in Brazil 131 g CO2/km.
POWERTRAIN AND FUEL STRATEGY
The Volkswagen Group’s Powertrain and Fuel Strategy is based on  
a three-pronged approach consisting of the optimization of con-
ventional powertrains, more intensive use of low-carbon fuels and 
greater focus on hybrid/all-electric powertrains. It paves the way for 
carbon-neutral, sustainable mobility in line with the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aim to boost power-
train efficiency with each new generation of vehicles – regardless 
of whether they are driven by combustion engines, hybrid drives, 
plug-in hybrids, all-electric powertrains or, perhaps in the near 
future, fuel-cell systems. All our mobility concepts are tailored to 
the requirements and customer needs of our respective markets. By 
taking this approach, we will broaden our portfolio of drive systems, 
aiming for increased coexistence of conventional powertrains and 
electric mobility systems in the future. Our current modular matrix 
platforms are designed so that the full range of drive systems can 
be deployed and flexibly fitted on production lines in all our global 
locations. In the future, Volkswagen will focus on massively expand-
ing our range of electric drives. We will also be adding an electrified 
version of our modular matrix (the Modular Electrification Toolkit or 
MEB) that will form the backbone of upcoming electric vehicles. In 
addition,  Volkswagen is accelerating the introduction of liquid and 
gaseous fuels from renewable or CO2-neutral sources. Even users of 
existing vehicles can benefit from these approaches.

Powertrain an Fuel Strategie
VW passat GTE – fuel consumption in l/100 km: from 1.7 to 1.6 (combined); energy 
consumption in kWh/100 km: from 12.8 to 12.2 (combined); Co2 emissions in  
g/km: from 39 to 37 (combined); Co2 efficiency class: A+
We have significantly reduced the fuel consumption of our vehicles 
with conventional drive systems through the use of efficient TFSI, TSI 
and TDI engines, dual-clutch transmissions, lightweight construction 
and improved aerodynamics. And we continue to work to enhance our 
conventional powertrains’ potential for improvement and make our 
engines as clean as possible by fitting our petrol engines with gasoline 
particulate filters, our diesel engines with the latest and most efficient 
SCR catalytic converters. 
Over the reporting period, Volkswagen continued to develop the 
TSI engine family. The latest generation celebrated its debut in the 
spring of 2017, in the form of the 1.5 TSI evo in the new Golf. This 
will be followed by various new engines, including a BlueMotion  
version capable of 96 kW (130 hp). The TSI evo is the perfect valida-
tion of the Group’s strategy of using modular high-tech toolkits  
to make pioneering technologies available to customers in standard 
production vehicles.
GASOLINE PARTICULATE FILTERS (GPF)
Particulate filters for petrol engines, known as “gasoline 
particulate filters (GPF)”, will come into much more wide-
spread use across our whole portfolio. In a step-by-step 
rollout starting in 2017, all the Group fleet’s direct-injection 
TSI and TFSI engines will be fitted with gasoline particulate 
filters. This will reduce emissions of fine soot particulates by 
direct-injection petrol engines by up to 90%.
By 2022, up to seven million Volkswagen Group vehicles 
could be fitted with the technology every year. The first 
engines to be equipped with GPF in june 2017 will be the 
1.4 TSI in the new Volkswagen Tiguan and the 2.0 TFSI in 
the Audi A52. The system will then be implemented in other 
models and engine generations.

1.5 TSI EVO ENGINES
The latest generation of the new EA211 TSI Evo engine, presented at the international Vienna 
Motor Symposium, starts with the 1.5 TSI, initially with outputs of 96 kW and 110 kW. Highlights 
of the new power unit include the first-time appearance in a production car of an exhaust-gas 
turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG), the Miller combustion process with a high 
compression ratio of 12.5:1, a common-rail injection system with pressures of up to 350 bar, an 
innovative thermal management system, and ACT variable cylinder deactivation technology. 
These high-technology elements result in efficiency improvements of up to 10% compared with 
the previous- generation 1.4 TSI engine (92 kW). The improvements in fuel con sumption take 
effect across broad swathes of the engine map, so have a direct impact on customers’ everyday 
driving experience.
Natural-gas engines play an important role in our powertrain portfolio.  
The chemical composition of the fuel means that CO2 emission levels 
are around 25% lower than those produced by petrol (gasoline) engines.  
Our customers can experience this in the new Golf TGI (81 kW with 
six-speed transmission: natural gas 3.6 kg/100 km and 98 g CO2/km; 
81 kW with DSG: natural gas 3.5 kg/100 km and 95 g CO2/km).
Both the Audi A4 g-tron and the Audi A5 Sportback g-tron exhib-
ited in Geneva in 2017 are sporty, versatile and optionally almost 
carbon-neutral. The two g-tron models will be launched in the spring 
of 2017, representing yet another Audi offering that contributes to 
the future of sustainable mobility. Following the launch of the A3 
Sportback g-tron, this will bring another two other models to market 
that run on natural gas or Audi’s climate-friendly e-gas. 
Natural gas is also an economical, clean alternative for powering 
heavy commercial vehicles. In order to be able to use natural-gas 
engines in long-distance trucks and buses, however, compressed 
natural gas (CNG) must be replaced with liquefied natural gas (lNG), 
because this is the only way to achieve the required energy density 
and hence the desired range. The relevant infrastructure must be  
improved before the widespread use of natural gas as a fuel becomes  
feasible. For example, only a few countries have well-developed 
networks of filling stations offering natural gas. With Scania’s intro-
duction of the opticruise automated gearshift system for gas trucks,  
these vehicles are becoming more attractive. Now offering gas  
trucks running on biogas, ethanol and ordinary diesel engines adap-
ted for biodiesel and HVO, Scania is strengthening its position as 
the commercial vehicle manufacturer with the broadest range of 
vehicles running on renewable fuels. MAN also manufactures Euro-6 
trucks and buses with various drive systems that can be powered  
by biodiesel or biomethane (sustainable natural gas). 
We are expanding our conventional and natural gas-powered engine 
range using components that electrically assist the powertrain, and 
are determined to make electric mobility a new Volkswagen trade-
mark. Our range already includes all-electric vehicles such as the e-up!, 
the e-load up! and the new e-Golf, which, with a maximum range of 
300 km (NEDC), has a significantly longer range than its predecessor. 
All these vehicles are already capable of driving with zero local emis-
sions on short and medium journeys. By combining drive concepts in 
this way, Volkswagen sees an oppor tunity to offer customers electric 
vehicles that will meet almost all their mobility needs, build trust in 
the new technologies, and thus help bring about the electric mobility 
breakthrough.
Most customers want to take their vehicles on longer trips as well. 
Until all-electric vehicles offer the range required for longer journeys, 
Volkswagen regards plug-in hybrid vehicles that combine highly 
efficient combustion engines with zero-emission electric motors as an 
excellent bridging technology. For some years, we have been offering 
hybrid models in multiple vehicle classes. Porsche showed off the new 
Panamera E-Hybrid at the Paris Motor SHow. And across the Group 
as a whole, we will be launching 17 new plug-in hybrids over the next 
two years. By 2025, we intend to bring 30 new all-electric vehicles to 
market.
The percentage of drivers who mainly travel short distances is 
growing. They include commuters and city residents, but also delivery 
vehicles in urban areas. The population shift towards urban areas 
 continues unabated, and is by no means confined to the burgeoning  
megacities of Asia and South America. On short, local journeys, all- 
electric vehicles like the e-up!, e-load up! and e-Golf are emission-free, 
hence of particular interest to customers who only cover short or 
me dium distances in their everyday driving. Private battery recharging 
options – such as charging stations installed on customers’ premises –  
must be supplemented by a good public recharging infrastructure in 
the medium to long term.
September saw the groundbreaking ceremony for Dresden’s largest 
electric mobility recharging facility. The facility, which is directly adja-
cent to the Volkswagen “Gläserne Manufaktur” (Transparent Factory) 
exhibition space, obtains the electricity it needs for its fast-charging 
stations from photovoltaic panels on the Volkswagen building. This 
ensures that the recharged vehicles are carbon-neutral.

The Volkswagen Group’s modular toolkit strategy achieves significant 
synergies by focusing on modules that can be used across multiple 
model series and brands. The vehicle architecture is designed in such  
a way that all types of drive system can be integrated flexibly and 
economically. This is particularly true of models based on the same 
platform; for example, they can use a standardized plug-in hybrid 
system consisting of a highly efficient turbocharged petrol engine, an 
electric motor, a compact six-speed dual-clutch transmission devel-
oped specifically for these applications, and a lithium-ion battery. 
We have incorporated the production of electrified vehicles into the 
manufacturing processes at our existing factories, including Wolfs-
burg, Emden, Bratislava, Ingolstadt and leipzig.
The Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) is designed as a new 
toolkit for building vehicles based on an all-electric powertrain. This 
design approach offers a wide range of advantages, especially in 
terms of packaging, i.e. the arrangement of powertrain components, 
auxiliary systems and interior features.
The first compact Volkswagen based on the MEB will be the I. D., 
which celebrated its world premiere at the Paris Motor Show where 
it kicked off the countdown to the future. A new electric car fleet will 
soon follow. The I.D. has a range of between 400 and 600 km (250-
400 miles), and thanks to a newly developed “design DNA” for elec-
tric cars, will be immediately recognizable as a zero-emission vehicle.
The new compact electric car will be launched in 2020, in parallel 
with the new Golf – at a price level equivalent to a comparably 
powerful, well-equipped Golf. The production version of the I.D. will 
make a significant contribution to ramping up the electric mobility 
market. Initially, the powertrain in the I.D. will consist of an electric 
motor with a peak output of 125 kW (170 hp) which, together 
with power electronics and transmission, is built into the rear axle. 
Other powertrain components include a high-voltage flat battery 
built into the floor of the car, and auxiliary systems housed in the 
front of the vehicle.

later production versions may also include electric motors with 
more or less power, but the design concept also allows for I. D. 
 models with different sizes of battery. 
The vehicle’s battery can be charged by cable or through an inductive 
charging interface in the front of the vehicle. It will also be possible 
to send the car away to automatically recharge itself by induction. 
The fast-charging system means that it takes just 30 minutes to 
recharge the battery to 80% capacity.
The heart of an electric vehicle is its battery, the energy content of 
which is the deciding factor in determining the vehicle’s range. For 
Starting in 2016, we have been producing electrified vehicles based 
on our Modular longitudinal Matrix (MlB) locally in China. Electrified 
vehicles based on our Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) will follow 
at a later date. We are also planning to localize core components, 
including the high-voltage battery system. 
all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, we currently use lithium-ion 
cells that are assembled into battery systems at our Braunschweig 
factory. We are also researching other types of battery based on 
solid electrolytes, which have a higher energy density and also meet 
stricter safety standards. We are investigating ways of industrializing 
these technologies. Meanwhile, the next generation of electric and 
plug-in hybrid vehicles will still be fitted with improved lithium-ion 
technology. Electric motors are manufactured at our plant in Kassel.

Hydrogen will still not be widely available as a fuel in the medium 
term. Both hydrogen filling stations and production plants for produc-
ing hydrogen as a renewable will need to be developed. Volkswagen 
has been working on fuel-cell technologies for over 15 years and has 
gained extensive experience operating test fleets. The decision as to 
whether to proceed to series production will depend on market re-
quirements and infrastructure. Volkswagen is actively involved in the 
H2 Mobility project, the aim of which is the systematic development 
of an H2 infrastructure in Germany. 
CO2 LIMITS FOR TRUCKS AND BUSES
Having already adopted CO2 legislation for passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles, in May 2014 the European Commission set out 
its strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from trucks and buses, with 
the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from the entire EU commercial- 
vehicle fleet. Until now, CO2 emissions from commercial vehicles have 
not been recorded, since the size, weight, application, mileage and us-
age conditions of trucks and buses are extremely varied. Manufac-
turers are currently collaborating with the EU Commission to draw 
up a generally accessible quantification and binding declaration of 
vehicle CO2 emissions using the VECTO CO2 simulation model (Vehicle 
Energy Consumption Calculation Tool). The aim is to further enhance 
transparency and increase market pressure. Before the EU agrees CO2 
limits for trucks and buses, however, an impact assessment must first 
be carried out in order to identify the most cost-effective solution.
Given the huge diversity of vehicle models and multi-stage pro-
duction processes that characterize heavy commercial vehicles, it 
would not be appropriate to use the one-size-fits-all approach to 
maximum admissible CO2 limits applied to cars and vans. Along with 
our competitors, we advocate a transparent quantification of CO2 
emissions that looks at the vehicle as a whole, i.e. including trailers  
and bodywork, and not just at the engine or tractor unit. This trans-
parency should intensify the competition to build the most fuel- 
efficient, hence carbon-efficient, commercial vehicles, resulting in 
lower CO2 emissions. Europe’s commercial-vehicle industry supports 
the aim of reducing CO2 emissions and improving road safety.
However, new vehicles are not solely responsible for CO2 emission 
trends. Important roles are also played by tires with reduced rolling 
resistance, by the aerodynamic trim of trailers, and by driving be-
havior, as well as alternative fuels, transport infrastructure and traffic 
conditions. In view of this, there is a joint obligation on automakers, 
but also on policy-makers, automotive suppliers, petroleum companies  
and logistics companies, to take concerted action to minimize CO2 
emissions in the European transport sector. Possible solutions could 
include long trucks; according to scientific studies by the Federal 
Highway Research Institute (BASt), they could cut CO2 emissions by 
up to 25% and are currently participating in field trials on German 
roads. This would make tackling CO2 emissions the joint responsibility 
of manufacturers, haulage companies and policy- makers. The state 
would be responsible for developing appropriate infrastructure, the 
haulage companies for a more intelligent manag ment of logistics 
processes. As manufacturers, our responsibility would include invest-
ing in the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles and alterna-
tive powertrains.
Thanks to our conventional and alternative technologies, as well as 
our modular toolkit strategy (including the new MEB), which allows 
innovations to be incorporated rapidly into different vehicles, we 
are ideally positioned to meet the challenges of the future. We have 
expanded our expertise in the field of electric traction by bringing 
 additional specialists and experts on board.

NEDC TEST CYCLE COMES IN FOR CRITICISM
The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the procedure used in 
the EU to measure passenger-car fuel consumption, has come in 
for repeated criticism from environmental organizations. Critics 
claim that the CO2 emissions measured in the NEDC’s 20-minute 
laboratory-based test cycle are much lower than the emission levels 
generated in today’s actual, on-the-road driving conditions. like all 
other vehicle manufacturers, however, we must comply with this 
legally mandated test cycle.
The European Union is planning to introduce the new World light 
Vehicles Test Procedure (WlTP) in September 2017, which is intended 
to produce more realistic consumption figures. Volkswagen wel-
comes the introduction of this new test procedure. like the NEDC, 
the WlTP aims to provide an objective benchmark for comparing 
technical products. 
LIFE CYCLE ENGINEERING
A comprehensive environmental assessment entails more than just an 
analysis of fuel consumption; it must consider all the environmental 
impacts of a vehicle over its full life cycle, from the manufacturing pro-
cess – including resource extraction, production of materials, supplier 
processes and our own in-house production at all locations – through 
the use phase – including driving emissions, fuel preparation and 
supply – through to the ultimate recycling of the vehicle at the end of 
its life cycle.
Improving each vehicle’s environmental performance over its full 
life cycle is one of our Technical Development department’s most 
firmly anchored environmental objectives. In order to meet this goal, 
we prepare detailed life cycle assessments (lCA) of new vehicles, 
powertrains, components and materials, so as to identify those areas 
where improvements will have the biggest effect. We then develop 
innovations targeting precisely these hotspots. This process is known 
as life Cycle Engineering. An eponymous working group is tasked 
with ensuring the uniform Group-wide implementation of life Cycle 
Engineering. One of the outcomes of the working group’s activities 
was the creation of the in-house software package lEAD (life Cycle 
Environmental Assessment Database), a server-based system for the 
Group-wide sharing of harmonized data that guarantees the use of 
standardized routines for calculating environmental footprints.
As part of optimizing the whole value chain in the most holistic way, 
we aim to minimize the environmental impact of our vehicles by 
working closely with our suppliers. This is why Volkswagen joined the 
CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP) back in 2015. In addition, we seek to 
stay in direct contact with our suppliers by organizing targeted work-
A further important European regulation pertains to Real Driving 
Emissions (RDE) for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.  
The packages of legislation are currently being elaborated; uniform 
limits for nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions will then apply 
across the EU from September 2017. These limits must be com-
plied with in real-world road traffic, making the RDE test procedure 
fundamentally different from the Euro 6 standard still in force, which 
stipulates that the limits are compulsory on the test bed. The RDE 
regulation is intended primarily to improve air quality in urban areas 
and areas close to traffic. It will lead to stricter requirements for 
exhaust gas aftertreatment in passenger cars and light commercial 
vehicles.
shops in which we jointly discuss and develop innovative approaches 
to the environmental optimization of components and processes.
In 2016, we used the CDP SCP to send out a questionnaire to 119 sup-
pliers. We received comprehensive responses from 83% of them – 13% 
more than the average response rate in the SCP. This year, the CDP 
evaluated the “Ability” of the 3,300 participating companies to make 
contact with their suppliers. On a scale from A to D, Volkswagen 
achieved an A– ranking, versus an average rating of C–. The ranking 
was based on an analysis of the answers to the questionnaire.
We report on life Cycle Engineering successes to our customers, share-
holders and other stakeholders by issuing what we call Environmental 
Commendations. Based on an environmental impact assessment 
complying with ISO standards 14040 and 14044, Environmental Com-
mendations describe the environmental improvements in our latest 
models compared with their predecessors. The Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars and Commercial Vehicles brands both publish Environmental 
Commendations. So does the Audi brand, under the heading Environ-
mental Footprint. 
Alongside lCAs, we also use other life-cycle approaches. In 2015, we 
worked closely with the Technical University of Berlin (Technische Uni-
versität Berlin) to further develop our methods for calculating what is 
known as the “water footprint”. Based on a vehicle’s lCA, we calculate 
and analyze the amount of water consumed by the vehicle over its 
entire life cycle. This enables us to take specific actions to reduce water 
consumption
RESOURCE EFFICIENCY 
Compared with purely environmental life Cycle Engineering, our 
analysis of the efficiency of our resource utilization takes the whole 
process one step further. Measures to improve a product’s environ-
mental performance over its life cycle are also assessed in commercial 
terms, so we can identify which approaches achieve the greatest 
environmental improvements in relation to the amount invested.
Group Research is involved in two long-term projects examining 
what the resource-efficient factory and resource-efficient vehicle 
of the future will look like. New technologies such as electric and 
fuel-cell vehicles play a key role here, especially in terms of their 
resource requirements as well as new closed-loop recycling concepts.

Minimizing our consumption of primary raw materials is a key 
objective for Volkswagen. With this in mind, we explicitly insist 
on the use of quality-assured recycled materials in almost all 
vehicle components.
Recycled materials – also referred to as secondary raw materials –  
are materials manufactured from production residues or end-
of-life materials. They must meet the same high Volkswagen 
quality standards as primary raw materials; this we ensure by 
subjecting them to regular inspections. Only the highest quality 
materials are used in order to guarantee the safety, reliability 
and longevity of our products and satisfy our customers’ ex-
tremely high expectations.
To calculate the proportion of recycled materials in an entire 
vehicle, we identify the materials in all its components and their 
recycled material content, and add them up. In order to do this, 
we depend on reliable information obtained directly from our 
suppliers, as well as data from industry-specific associations, 
since a single vehicle model may include around 5,000 compo-
nents containing more than 10,000 material items.
As well as dramatically improving a vehicle’s environmental 
footprint, the use of recycled and renewable materials can also 
make good economic sense. New Volkswagen branded vehicles 
already have a high proportion of recycled and renewable 
content, accounting for approximately one-third of the weight 
of six models (Polo 5 and 6, Golf 6 and 7, Passat 8, Sharan) for 
which precise figures have already been calculated.
Wherever possible, the Group’s brands use renewable raw 
materials. For example, natural fibers like flax, cotton, wood, 
cellulose and hemp are used in floor insulation, boot linings, 
door and side panel trim and hood insulation. Similarly, kenaf 
and flax fibers are used in armrests, while paper fibers are used 
in cargo floors and roof reinforcement structures, and cotton 
fibers in floor insulation.
In December 2016, Volkswagen signed a pilot agreement for 
returning scrap aluminium directly to suppliers for subsequent 
reuse in vehicles. The implementation of the Aluminium Closed 
loop Project in 2017 will be the very first time a closed loop  
for aluminium has been organized with non-Group suppliers.

LIGHTWEIGHT CONSTRUCTION
lightweight body shell production remains a strategic development 
priority. Volkswagen uses hot-formed, high-strength steels in pro duc-
tion models. We are also pursuing a composite materials approach 
for specific vehicles and platforms, using a range of different mate-
rials in one body shell. lightweight materials such as aluminium are 
also used in the development of new platforms. 
The proportion of hot-formed metals in the latest Passat has been  
increased by more than 75% compared with its predecessor. New 
additions include crossmembers at the front and rear of the car and in 
the transmission tunnel. While this means more energy is consumed 
in the production process, the reduced fuel consumption resulting 
from component weight savings has a dramatic impact on CO2 emis-
sions and energy consumption over the vehicle’s life cycle as a whole.
Porsche continues to pursue a policy of “smart lightweight con-
struction” by implementing a sophisticated mix of materials in body 
designs. One example from the reporting period is the start of series 
production of the new Panamera. For the first time, the Panamera’s 
roof and side panels are made out of aluminium, and more than 30% 
of the bodywork is also now made out of aluminium. But the pro-
portion of high-strength steel alloys has also been increased, among 
other things by integrating a highly complex tube of super-high-
strength steel as the bulkhead support. 
On September 22, 2016, the Open Hybrid labFactory (OHlF) was 
opened in the presence of Federal Research Minister Professor Wanka 
and other dignitaries. We are researching economical lightweight 
construction technologies for series production as part of the OHlF 
public-private partnership, a joint venture with the lower Saxony 
Research Center for Vehicle Technology (NFF) at the Technical Univer-
sity of Braunschweig, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft and various other 
industry partners.
Audi is committed to the use of lightweight construction to 
improve the dynamics of its models while at the same time 
reducing fuel consumption. The Audi Q7 body is largely made of 
aluminium. Thanks to the Audi Space Frame construction, the 
vehicle body only weighs a little more than 200 kg – 71 kg less 
than its predecessor. The weight of the vehicle as a whole has 
been reduced by as much as 325 kg. 
lightweight construction and a high level of rigidity are also 
defining characteristics of the body shell of the Audi R8 Coupé. 
Along with various aluminium components, the supercar’s  
high-strength, almost torsion-free backbone consists of a rear 
panel, center tunnel and three-part B-pillars that are all made  
of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP).
Similarly, lightweight construction plays a key role in the success-
ful new Audi A4, which entered production in 2015. Depending 
on the model variant, an intelligent choice of materials and more 
extensive use of lightweight construction techniques make the 
new Audi A4 a full 65 kg lighter than its predecessor. The car 
produces 6 t fewer greenhouse gas emissions (equivalent to  
CO2) over its full life cycle than its predecessor, thanks to the use 
of eco-friendly production methods, reduced weight, and a wide 
range of efficiency enhancements such as outstanding aero-
dynamics (the 1.4 TFSI ultra has a drag coefficient of just 0.23). 
This translates into a 16% improvement. In this way, we have 
succeeded in reducing emissions even at the production stage, 
despite our increased use of lightweight construction materials. 
While the earlier model generated around 7.16 t of greenhouse 
gases in the production phase, the new Audi A4’s production 
process has reduced this by around 4% to 6.85 t.

ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS
Volkswagen Group and Group brand models received numerous 
awards in 2016 for their environmentally friendly features. Here are 
some examples:
 § In the ADAC EcoTest, the models tested in 2016 – including the 
ŠKODA Octavia Combi 1.4 TSI G-TEC, ŠKODA Superb Combi 1.6 TDI 
Greenline and VW Passat Variant 1.6 TDI SCR BlueMotion – were 
all awarded the top 5-star rating. The overall results of the ADAC 
EcoTest are based on a range of metrics, including tests of emis-
sions of e.g. carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and 
particulates in realistic driving cycles. Driving cycles are conducted 
with daytime running lights (or low-beam headlights) switched 
on, the air-conditioning system turned on, and a 200 kg payload. 
In late 2016, the ADAC EcoTest methodology was revised. Vehicles 
that achieve good results in the EcoTest must now also be tested 
on the road using a PEMS device (Portable Emission Measurement 
System). In 2016, the VW up! 1.0 TSI BMT beats was subjected to 
and successfully passed such a PEMS re-test. 
 § AUTO TEST, the monthly consumer advice edition of AUTO BIlD, 
and ÖKOTREND, the independent environmental research institu-
tion, presented awards for the most environmentally friendly cars  
in all classes in 2016. Two Volkswagen Passenger Cars models won 
in their respective classes: the eco-up! 1.0 EcoFuel in the sub-
compact class and the Passat GTE in the upper medium (mid-size 
 luxury) class. The Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid was voted number 
one in the SUV class. Assessment criteria included the manu-
facturer’s commitment to environmental protection and social 
responsibility, and the environmental impact of the vehicles  
over their entire life cycle.
 § In the China Eco-Car Assessment Programme (C-ECAP), the VW Golf 
TSI was the first vehicle ever to be awarded the platinum medal, 
the best possible ranking. Vehicles were evaluated in six categories, 
including energy efficiency and recycling quotient.
 § In the 2017 VCS environmental rankings, three Group models – the 
VW up!, ŠKODA Citigo and SEAT Mii – took first places in the sub-
compact (mini) class.
 § In the compact (small family) class, the Audi A3 Sportback TFSI 
g-tron beat the VW Golf TGI; both vehicles are equipped with 
natural- gas drive systems.
 § The Caddy TGI beat out other 5-seater vans to take first place.
 § The editorial team of Engadget, one of the leading U. S. online 
technology magazines, bestowed this year’s “Best of CES” award

ENVIRONMENT TASK FORCE
We set up the Environment Task Force in 2014, with the aim of 
identifying and implementing savings initiatives at Group locations. 
This team of analysts from the Group environmental research unit 
acts as a networking intermediary between departments involved in 
planning, maintenance and operations, helping to close any gaps by 
providing additional capacity and local expertise.
The broad-based knowledge of the Environment Task Force, com-
bined with the many excellent ideas and solutions from col-
leagues in our various locations, plus the sharing of initiatives via 
massnahmen@web, all help to promote a lively, Group-wide dialog.
Production and Logistics 
By 2018, the Volkswagen Group is aiming to reduce levels of the five 
key environmental indicators per vehicle manufactured – energy  
and water consumption, waste for disposal, and CO2 and VOC emis-
sions – by 25% compared with the 2010 baseline. This target applies 
to all the Group’s production locations for passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles, and builds on the general production process 
requirements defined in the Group Environmental Principles. We 
have already made considerable progress towards reducing all five 
key indicators.
In terms of environmental impact reduction per unit (UEP), we had 
already reached our goal by the end of 2016, having cut produc-
tion-related environmental impacts by 25.3%. The status at the end 
of 2016 compared with the 2010 baseline breaks down as follows 
(2015 figures in brackets):
 § specific energy consumption: –17.0% (–16.4%)
 § specific CO2 emissions: –19.5% (–19.5%)
 § specific VOC emissions: –41.3% (–30.5%)
 § specific water consumption: –14.2% (–8.8%)
 § specific waste for disposal: –34.6% (–32.1%)
The reduction in environmental impacts across the Group is the 
result of specific environmental programs by the individual brands, 
including:
 § Think Blue. Factory. – Volkswagen Passenger Cars and  
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles
 § ultra-strategy – Audi
 § Green Factory – ŠKODA
 § ECOMOTIVE Factory – SEAT
 § Environmental Factory – Bentley
 § Resource-efficient Production – Porsche
 § Blue Rating – Scania
 § Climate Strategy – MAN
We encourage close integration and communication between the 
brands worldwide in order to create synergies, for example with 
our Environment Task Force. We record and catalog environmental 
measures in an IT system and make these available for Group-wide 
sharing of best practices.
In the reporting period, more than 1,600 implemented measures 
relating to energy and the environment were documented in this 
system, all serving to improve passenger car and light commercial 
vehicle production processes. As well as being worthwhile from an 
environmental viewpoint, these activities also make financial sense, 
resulting in annual savings of around €49 million. The measures are 
helping us reduce all five key environmental indicators, although 
additional negative effects meant that the indicators for energy con-
sumption and CO2 emissions did not change very significantly.
Although 2016 was – yet again – the world’s warmest year since 
climate records began, a colder winter resulted in increased heating 
demand across Group locations.
At Volkswagen-branded component manufacturing facilities, the 
team works hand in hand with the energy management teams in 
Component Planning, who also help identify potential savings.
Up to and including 2016, the Environment Task Force was involved 
in 25 projects around the world. Over this period, they implemented 
savings measures worth €2 million and identified potential savings 
at Group locations estimated at an additional €9 million.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS 
In 2016, energy consumption per vehicle fell from 2,106 kWh in 
2015 to 2,090 kWh in 2016. Absolute volumes increased due to  
the larger number of vehicles produced. This meant that we reduced 
energy consumption by –17.0% (against the 2010 baseline).
CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle rose from 882 kg in 2015 
to 883 kg in 2016. Absolute volumes also increased due to the larger 
number of vehicles produced. This represents a –19.5% reduction in 
CO2 emissions compared with the 2010 baseline.
Our strategy for meeting our targets includes improving energy  
efficiency, replacing coal with gas for our in-house energy production,  
and purchasing electricity from renewable sources. We now meet 
around one-third of our global electricity requirements from re-
newables.
Examples of Best Practice
We set a particularly positive example in Brazil, switching to 100% 
renewable energy despite the country’s ongoing economic diffi-
culties. This measure is reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 
21,000 t per year.
In 2016, the first industrial combined heat and power plant in 
the greater Shanghai metropolitan area went into operation at 
 Volkswagen’s Chinese plant in Anting, in the form of a MAN CHP 
plant. The power plant supplies the site with 26 MW of electricity 
and 60 t/h of steam. This covers most of the energy and all of  
the steam requirements of Car Plant 3, meaning that Anting is now 
making annual savings of around 95,000 MWh of energy and 
59,300 t of CO2.
Since 2011, VW Kraftwerk GmbH has been investing in the ongoing 
development of renewables and the construction of highly efficient 
combined heat and power (CHP) plants driven by natural gas. In the 
period to 2016, the company invested around €26 million in renew-
ables such as wind farms and photovoltaic power plants. As part 
of our fuel conversion strategy, VW Kraftwerk GmbH also invested 
some €15 million in a cogeneration plant in Braunschweig and some 
€65 million in a gas and steam turbine (combined cycle) plant in 
 Kassel. Furthermore, alongside the company’s own electricity gener-
ation activities, we are currently implementing a proportional energy 
program for the Volkswagen Group’s production sites in Germany 
using carbon-neutral Volkswagen Naturstrom®. Over the next few 
years, VW Kraftwerk GmbH is planning to invest in a new combined 
cycle plant in Wolfsburg (by 2022) and in the further development  
of renewables.
 § lamborghini: New combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) and 
district heating plants, coupled with a 17,000 sqm photovoltaic 
system on the roof of the central production shop at the Sant’Agata 
site in Italy, were the main factors contributing to the brand’s 
certification as a carbon-neutral manufacturer. Annual CO2 emis-
sions at the lamborghini site have been cut by around 820 t. 
By the end of 2017, the CCHP is expected to reduce annual CO2 
emissions to around 5,600 t, and the company is also planning 
to convert the plant to run on biogas. Compensatory measures 
will be taken to offset the remaining CO2 emissions. lamborgh-
ini is the first company in the world to be certified by DNV Gl 
(Det Norske Veritas Germanischer lloyd) under their “Carbon 
Neutrality” program. DNV Gl is one of the world’s leading ser-
vice-providers in the classification, verification and management 
of environmental risks.

ENVIroNMENT    PRODUCTION AND lOGISTICS 
A number of other examples illustrate our success in saving energy 
and reducing CO2 emissions:
 § VW: One important lever for reducing energy consumption is on- 
demand operation of all facilities. In 2016, we reinforced the energy 
efficiency gains from the first pilot projects involving the load- 
dependent operation of paint dryers by rolling out the technology 
at more locations. The change has cut energy requirements by 
around 7,300 MWh a year, saving around €290,000 and reducing 
annual CO2 emissions by approximately 1,900 t.
 § In 2016, MAN successfully recovered thermal energy at the ship 
engine test facility in Frederikshavn, Denmark, using the newly 
installed heat recovery system. The recovered energy was supplied 
to the municipal district heating system. The heat recovery system 
is enabling us to avoid over 1,300 t in CO2 emissions. 
 § VW: We use energy value stream analysis to identify suitable 
measures for reducing our energy KPI. This technique was trialed 
at our Bratislava location and others in 2014, reducing annual 
energy consumption by 12,916 MWh with annual savings of more 
than €900,000. This methodology has since been rolled out to 
other sites. 
Volkswagen AG plant in Bratislava, Slovakia
In our quest for improved environmental performance, the 
 Volkswagen Group does not limit its efforts to the internal work-
ings of our production facilities. We also keep a close eye on   
our buildings and real estate. With our Blue Building standard 
and internal “Blue Building” award for energy-efficient, sustain-
able construction, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions from our 
properties while ensuring that they are built and continue to 
operate sustainably. We aim to significantly undercut statutory 
energy consumption thresholds.
Volkswagen Immobilien completed the first Blue Building – a 
Volkswagen-brand car showroom in Hanover – at the end of 
2015. In the course of this project, the old building was demol-
ished, reprocessed on site and then reused as part of the foun-
dations for the new building and its outdoor facilities. Recycled 
waste glass was used as insulation underneath the building.  
BLUE BUILDING
All lighting in the building and its external facilities is provided 
by lEDs, while heat and power are supplied by a photovoltaic 
system and a CHP unit (manufactured by lichtblick). This cuts 
CO2 emissions by up to 58 t per year.
A ventilation and cooling system delivers a steady supply of 
fresh air, improving the overall quality of life within the build-
ing as well as the wellbeing of employees. At night or during 
the daytime, special louvered windows can be used to cool 
down the showroom by purely natural means.
Our aim is to steadily refine and improve the Blue Building 
standard. To do so, we systematically evaluate experience 
acquired during the planning, construction and operation of 
our buildings.

MATERIAL FLOW MANAGEMENT 
Volkswagen uses material flow management as a tool for analyzing 
and evaluating material flows in production and the associated 
environmental impacts.
Material flows are resources and energy which flow within specified  
system limits and can be allocated to production processes by 
originator. Material flow analysis allows us to depict processes more 
transparently, making it easier to recommend actions for reducing 
environmental impacts and cutting production costs.
The informative value of a material flow analysis depends on the 
data available. Incoming and outgoing material flows in process-
es must be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively, by 
reference to both internal environmental information systems and 
EMISSIONS TRADING 
The procedure for allocating CO2 emissions certificates under the 
European Union’s Emissions Trading System changed fundamentally 
in 2013, at the start of the third trading period (2013–2020). Since 
2013, emissions allowances for electricity providers have been auc-
tioned. For the manufacturing industry and certain types of power 
plant (e.g. CHP plants), a proportion of the certificates were initially 
allocated free of charge. However, over the course of the trading 
period, the number of such certificates has been steadily declining; 
providers requiring additional certificates must purchase them at 
auction. 
In certain industry (sub)sectors, there is a risk that production will 
be transferred to countries outside Europe now that the amended 
provisions governing emissions trading have come into force  
(a phenomenon known as “carbon leakage”). Based on pan-EU 
SOLVENTS 
In 2016, VOC emissions per vehicle were reduced from 2.80 kg in 
2015 to 2.42 kg. Compared with the 2010 baseline, emissions per 
vehicle were reduced by 41.3%. This impressive achievement, whereby 
targets were not only reached but exceeded in 2016, was driven by 
numerous VOC-reducing measures in many of the paint shops at 
Group locations, as well as the state-of-the-art painting and exhaust 
air treatment systems installed in new plants.
external databases. Any missing data is obtained from in-process 
measurements.
Material flow analyses are useful to a variety of players. They can 
be used to sensitize employees to the resource-efficient handling 
of process materials, as a useful aid for planning new, more re-
source-efficient plants, or as a decision-making tool for implement-
ing specific measures.
Two comprehensive material flow analyses focusing on material 
efficiency were carried out in the paint shops of our Poznan and 
Bratislava car factories. The measures identified in the course of 
these analyses are currently being prepared for implementation in 
production.
benchmarks, a set number of certificates are being allocated free of 
charge over the 2013–2020 trading period. The automotive industry 
was included in the new carbon leakage list that came into effect in 
2015.
A total of 30 Volkswagen Group locations are affected by the Euro-
pean Emissions Trading System. For 2016, 1,186,418 emissions 
certificates were allocated to the Volkswagen Group free of charge 
(39,769 fewer than in the previous year). 
As well as the European Union, other countries in which the  
Volkswagen Group has production sites are also considering the  
introduction of emissions trading. Seven pilot projects have  
been launched in China, for example, although they have not yet  
affected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government plans  
to expand these pilot projects to form a national emissions trading 
system.
Examples of Best Practice 
 § A new, low-impact top coat painting line came onstream in 
 Ingolstadt. Featuring state-of-the-art technology such as air 
recirculation, dry scrubbing and exhaust air purification, the new 
facility has reduced the consumption of thermal energy and  
water per car by 20%. Furthermore, air recirculation is helping to 
reduce CO2 emissions per painted vehicle by 30%, while exhaust 
air purification is reducing VOC emissions by 90%.

WATER 
In 2016, water consumption per vehicle was reduced from 4.1 m3 
in 2015 to 3.9 m3. Despite the larger number of vehicles produced, 
freshwater consumption per vehicle has steadily fallen since 2010 
thanks to a raft of recycling measures and the introduction of manu-
facturing techniques that use minimal water.
Alongside climate protection, conserving our planet’s freshwater  
reserves is one of the pivotal requirements for preserving the basic 
necessities of life. Water resources are already scarce in many re-
gions of the world, and access to clean drinking water is an increas-
ingly pressing problem for large sections of the global population. 
This prompted us to adopt water as a focus topic for 2014. Within 
our sphere of influence, we also support the United Nations’ Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in September 2015. 
Drawing on the comprehensive data collated in our life cycle 
assessments, we published a pioneering analysis of our water foot-
print in 2013, in which we identified those processes that consume  
the most water over the life cycle of a representative selection of 
 Volkswagen-branded models. In 2015, we worked with the Technical 
University of Berlin to further refine the in-house methodology 
used to calculate our water footprint.
The water footprint analysis showed that the use phase plays only a 
minor role. Much of the water consumed is due to the fuel produc-
tion process. Another significant water consumer is the supply chain 
for the extraction or creation of raw materials, over which we have 
no direct influence. Consequently, we are focusing our attention 
on areas where we can directly influence water consumption: our 
production sites. We are also making efforts to continuously reduce 
our water consumption by further improving our vehicles’ fuel 
consumption and using more secondary materials, such as recycled 
materials, in production. Our latest review indicates that 57% of our 
entire freshwater consumption – approximately 23 million m3 – is 
attributable to sites located in regions where groundwater resources 
are at risk, especially our plants in Mexico, Spain, South Africa, India 
and China. In these regions in particular, we have made minimiz-
ing water use an even higher priority. We adapt our water use to 
the varying regional availability of water resources worldwide. At 
the same time, we support a broad range of projects in which the 
protection or development of water resources is a key or even the 
primary objective. The same approach also characterizes the water 
management strategy adopted by the Corporate Environment & 
Energy Steering Committee, which defines four action areas: 
 § Safe and reliable water supply and sewerage. We aim to protect 
groundwater reserves against pollution, and to avoid production 
downtimes caused by water shortages.
 § Efficient water use throughout the life cycle. By using water as 
economically and efficiently as possible during the production pro-
cess, and by recycling as much water as possible, we aim to reduce 
total water consumption to the great possible extent.
 § Social and environmental initiatives. Particularly through our bio-
diversity projects, we help protect water resources and promote 
public environmental awareness.
 § Transparency. We communicate our goals and activities to the 
public. In 2013, Volkswagen became the world’s first automaker  
to commit to the United Nations’ CEO Water Mandate. Also, 
since 2011, we have been providing extensive disclosure of our 
water management practices and progress, by completing the 
very detailed CDP water management questionnaire. In 2015, we 
withdrew our responses in the light of the diesel issue. After a 
one-year suspension in 2015 as a consequence of the diesel issue, 
we rejoined the program in 2016, achieving a leadership rating  
of A– for our Water Disclosure Project.
2016 – “Year of Water” in China 
Given the high production volume in China, the country’s share  
of Group-wide water consumption is comparatively high. Conse-
quently, 2016 was designated the “year of Water” in China. Teams of 
experts analyzed water management at all Volkswagen production 
sites in China and implemented optimization measures in order to 
save even more water per vehicle produced. Between 2010 and 
2015, we had already achieved water savings of around 14.1% in 
China. In 2016, we achieved further significant water savings, bring-
ing total savings between 2010 and 2016 up to 22.4%. Systematic 
analysis enabled us to achieve savings in every part of the factory by, 
for example, optimizing cooling systems and introducing on-de-
mand management of paint consumption in the paint shop.

ENVIroNMENT    PRODUCTION AND lOGISTICS 
Examples of Best Practice 
 § We use recycling facilities at some of the Group’s locations that 
use a membrane process to prepare biologically precleaned waste 
water for reuse, thereby reducing freshwater consumption levels. 
In 2015, we brought a recycling facility on stream at our Salzgitter 
plant. This facility processes half the plant’s wastewater into 
recycled water and uses it to feed the central cooling tower. As a 
result of this measure, we save around 75,000 m3 of freshwater 
annually, equivalent to around a quarter of the plant’s needs. 
 § Our Uitenhage plant in South Africa has managed to reduce its 
water consumption per vehicle by more than 50% (from 6.2 to 
2.7 m³/vehicle). In 2015, this achievement so impressed the jury 
of the annual Greening the Future Awards competition that the 
plant won the national prize in the “Water Efficiency & Manage-
ment” category. 
By the end of 2016, the volume of waste for disposal per vehicle had 
been reduced from 16.2 kg in 2015 to 15.2 kg, representing a reduc-
tion of 34.6% against the 2010 baseline.
We aim to use materials and products as efficiently as possible, and 
so reduce the volume of waste per unit manufactured.
In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted a three-stage waste 
strategy: 
1.  Prioritizing waste recycling and reducing waste for disposal
2.  Reducing waste volumes via waste treatment
3.  Reducing waste volumes by optimizing production and  
ancillary processes
WASTE
Wherever possible, we make great efforts to use standardized waste 
management systems to optimize our waste management in all 
divisions. These systems are already used to control waste manage-
ment processes in all German factories run by the Volkswagen, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, Audi and MAN brands, 
and for state-monitored disposal of hazardous waste in particular 
(Electronic Government). The aim is to roll out these systems in 
Europe and thereafter across regions around the world.
ŠKODA plants in the Czech Republic and Volkswagen plants in  
Slovakia also use waste management systems. In 2015/16, implemen-
tation in the VW and SEAT plants in Spain, Portugal and Poland  
was coordinated with in-house IT departments and preliminary 
plans were drawn up. In 2017, plants in Spain will be equipped with 
a waste management system.
In 2015, in order to review our waste management processes and 
recycling, we introduced audits of waste disposal processes as a key 
control mechanism at many of our sites. This reflects our duty of 
care to ensure controlled, environmentally friendly waste disposal. 
In Germany, a standardized procedure for these audits was devel-
oped in collaboration with other vehicle manufacturers (original 
equipment manufacturers or OEMs) and major suppliers. In 2015 
and 2016, we carried out audits across multiple locations and OEMs 
in Europe. Audits have also been carried out in the regions, albeit 
exclusively for Volkswagen’s own brands. In order to set a common 
benchmark for the quality standards expected of waste disposal 
services, we also trained potential auditors at a number of eastern 
European sites, giving them the skills to carry out quality-assured 
audits so that the results could also be used by other OEMs and 
suppliers. Based on these positive experiences, similar training 
programs will be organized at other sites. Descriptions of the audit 
procedures, as well as audit documentation, are now available in 
the languages of the various countries in which the Group operates, 
with the exception of China.
 § In 2016 alone, our Foshan plant successfully reduced its water 
consumption by more than 26%, from 3.9 to 2.9 m³ per vehicle, 
by implementing measures devised during the “year of Water”.  
In total, the Group saved 906,807 m³ of freshwater in 2016 
compared with the previous year, thanks to a raft of individual 
measures and optimizations. However, factors beyond our control, 
such as fluctuating weather conditions, also influence freshwater 
consumption. With water prices ranging from around €0.3 – €1.0 
per m³, this translates into water supply cost savings of approxi-
mately €0.5 million in the reporting period.
In order to permanently implement water-saving processes within 
the Group, a new internal White Paper defines key requirements for 
the various processes in the production sequence.

ENVIroNMENT    PRODUCTION AND lOGISTICS 
Production waste from packaging and workshops, as well as the 
Technical Development department, is recycled to the highest  
possible standards. For the recycling of waste from production and 
logistics that has a resale value, such as paper, plastics, wood and 
metal, our Purchasing department has rolled out a Group-wide sys-
tem to improve the efficiency of the entire process. The focus here  
is not only on revenue generation, but also on optimized preparation 
of the waste for efficient transportation.
Examples of Best Practice
 § In january 2016, an advanced waste management system was 
introduced at our Bratislava plant for optimizing waste logistics 
processes. Transponder technology (based on Data Matrix code) 
is used to identify every single piece of waste at its point of origin 
and track it seamlessly all the way through to final disposal. At 
each stage of the disposal process, the system records the volume, 
fill level, degree of sorting and condition of waste container loca-
tions, as well as any wrongly disposed materials. Working together 
with the waste producers, the waste management department 
uses the collected information to develop suitable measures for 
optimizing container volumes, collection intervals, container 
locations and disposal routes in response to ambient production 
conditions. This tool has streamlined waste management at the 
Bratislava plant, as reflected in, for example, the 15% reduction in 
the amount of cost-incurring waste. Furthermore, substantially 
less time is required to collate waste figures for reports.
 § At the Audi site in Neckarsulm, special containers for dewatering 
paint sludge are being used experimentally. So far – and contrary 
to previous experience – the experiment has been successful. 
The system has reduced the residual liquid content of the sludge, 
hence the amount of waste, and the sludge has a more solid 
consistency. Whether the containers are suitable for permanent 
use will be decided after a long-term pilot.
 § At ŠKODA, transportable oil filtration systems are used to increase 
the service life of oils and so reduce the amount of waste oil. In 
addition, a new evaporator system for separating emulsions has 
gone into operation at the Vrchlabi plant, aiming to reduce the 
volume of waste emulsions for disposal. ŠKODA is also now using 
washable – i.e. reusable – cleaning cloths instead of disposable 
ones.
 § At the Braunschweig plant, press containers used for household- 
type commercial waste, cardboard, paper and plastic film are 
equipped with a GPS signaling system. The system automatically 
tracks the fill level and position of the containers. Once containers 
are 75% full, a signal is automatically sent to the waste disposal 
specialist for transport scheduling purposes. This has enabled the 
plant to significantly increase full container weights and so reduce 
the number of disposal runs.
GREEN LOGISTICS
logistics is part of the Volkswagen Group’s environmental focus.  
For example, we are optimizing the entire transport chain in order  
to avoid CO2 emissions. The aim is to avoid transportation com-
pletely or else shift to more environmentally friendly modes of trans-
port, and to reduce fuel consumption. We are pursuing measures 
and activities for optimizing logistics processes across our brands.
The Corporate Green logistics Working Group was set up in 2012. 
The Group is responsible for coordinating and jointly developing 
initiatives, accounting practices and training packages across the 
Group.
Choosing the right means of transport is a key starting point for 
reducing CO2 emissions. Maritime shipping is regarded as one of the 
most efficient transport options. So the Volkswagen Group is now 
involved in the Clean Shipping Network (CSN), an association of 
marine cargo owners, and is represented on its management board. 
CSN members can use the Clean Shipping Index (CSI) rating tool to 
compare environmental efficiency figures such as the emissions of 
individual ships on particular routes. This is useful for analyzing the 
environmental impact of shipping. At the request of Volkswagen 
AG and others, soot particles have now been included in the index, 
alongside CO2, NOx , SOx , water and chemicals.
Volkswagen Group logistics is continuously expanding the number  
of CSI-listed vessels in its own transport network. The ratio is 
regularly updated and considered whenever the Group offers new 
transport services to tender.
Starting in 2019, the Volkswagen Group will become one of the first 
vehicle logistics OEMs to use two car-carrying vessels powered by 
liquefied natural gas (lNG) supplied by Siem Car Carriers AS between 
Europe and North America. The alternative, lNG-driven marine en gine 
is improving the environmental compatibility of marine trans port  
and sustainably reducing airborne pollution – CO2 by up to 25% and 
NOx by up to 30%; soot particles by up to 60% and SOx by up to 100%.

Furthermore, the Group is constantly working to find and use alter-
native and more environmentally compatible transport options for 
material logistics. Materials from Turkey destined for Volkswagen 
Autoeuropa in Palmela, Portugal, have been shipped from Izmir to 
lisbon since late 2015. Previously, the materials traveled by truck.  
By changing the means of transport, the company is saving 240 t of 
CO2 per year and also cutting costs.
The Group Consolidation Center that opened in 2016 in Malacky 
near Bratislava is also helping to improve the environmentally 
friendly profile of logistics within the Volkswagen Group. Optimized 
thermal insulation is reducing heating costs; the use of double doors 
in the loading and unloading area is ensuring that heat losses are 
minimized, and lED lighting is cutting electricity consumption  
by around 50%. At the same time, the bundling of freight in the 
Consolidation Center has cut the daily traffic volume by an average 
of around 90 trucks in goods incoming, and around 65 trucks in 
goods dispatch.
BIODIVERSITY
Biodiversity signifies the variety of life on our planet, encapsulating 
the variety of species, genetic differences within species, and the 
diversity of ecosystems. We rely on it as the basis for our continued 
existence: healthy food, clean water, fertile soils and a balanced 
climate. Protecting biological diversity is one of the greatest societal 
challenges of our time. The United Nations has thus declared the 
current decade to be the “UN Decade on Biodiversity”.
Volkswagen has been committed to protecting biodiversity since 
2007 and is a founder member of the Biodiversity in Good Company 
e.V. initiative. In our mission statement, we promise to support the 
protection of species at all locations. On the basis of this commit-
ment, VW Mexico was invited to give a guest presentation at the 
Business and Biodiversity Forum in Cancun in December 2016. The 
Forum was part of the United Nations’ Conference of the Parties to 
the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP13-CBD). We primarily 
contribute to achieving the targets of the UN Convention on Biolog-
ical Diversity by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and utilizing 
materials and resources as efficiently as possible. As a consequence 
of the diesel issue, we are putting our membership of the Biodiver-
sity in Good Company e.V. initiative on hold for the time being.
Biodiversity is a component of our environmental management. 
We have, among other things, appointed a biodiversity officer and 
commissioned external expert assessments of the risks to water,  
the soil and biodiversity at 32 locations belonging to the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars, Porsche and MAN brands. 
One of the projects we jointly implemented with Naturschutzbund 
Deutschland e.V. (NABU) was a wetland conservation project in 
 Germany. In 2016, Volkswagen Financial Services AG once again 
made a donation in support of NABU’s International Peatland 
Conservation Fund. The company is currently sponsoring 13 wetland 
conservation projects in various parts of Germany ranging from 
lower Saxony to Bavaria, as well as projects in Poland, lithuania, 
latvia and Estonia. 
At our international sites, we collaborate with a range of partners to 
support the protection of nature and biodiversity. This means we can 
contribute to local implementation of the United Nations’ Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs). We also fund biodiversity research 
at our Urumqi site in the Chinese province of xinjiang. We have been 
supporting the Dyer Island Conservation Trust in South Africa since 
2011; in 2015, the Trust opened a care center for seabirds there. 
Since 2012, Volkswagen Slovakia has been engaged in a joint venture 
with Comenius University in Bratislava, breeding crayfish threatened 
with extinction with the aim of resettling them in Slovakia’s streams 
and rivers. In 2017, we are planning further research projects in 
 Slovakia’s nature reserves and lakes.

ENVIroNMENT    SAlES, USE AND RECyClING
Sales, use 
and recycling
Our philosophy of forward-thinking, environmentally minded 
mo bility spans every stage in the value chain. But the use phase is 
pivotal – not just in terms of impact, but also because it is critical  
to success as our customers’ needs continue to evolve. Fuel-efficient 
vehicles are just one, albeit vital, component of progressive mobility 
with a smaller carbon footprint. This is why we are committed to of-
fering our customers the fullest possible range of mobility services, 
and why the Group’s Environmental Strategy also embraces the final 
stage of the vehicle’s life cycle: recycling.
SMART MOBILITY
Objective
Mobility is an essential prerequisite of a functioning society and 
economic growth. Our aim is to make mobility even more efficient 
and environmentally compatible, but also to enable more people 
to play an active part in society – in line with the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We define “smart mobility” 
as optimized interaction between road users, infrastructure and 
different modes of transport. Digitalization and connectivity are 
pivotal in preparing for the use of new products and services and 
improving traffic flows. However, in addition to environmental pro-
tection, smart mobility is also synonymous with improved safety 
and the economical use of traffic areas, for example through the use 
of innovative assistance systems to circumvent traffic jams.
Strategic Approach
During the reporting period, Volkswagen continued its long-stand-
ing systematic research into mobility issues. In order to develop 
appropriate, intelligent solutions, auto mobility must be treated as 
part of a complete system that incorporates other modes of trans-
port, human settlement patterns, urban and infrastructural develop-
ments, new technologies – especially automatic driving, digitaliza-
tion, electric mobility and connectivity – as well as trending demand 
(e.g. carsharing, vehicle sharing) and other influencing factors. Part 
of our strategic approach is to maintain an intensive dialog with the 
general public and academia.
Challenges and their possible solutions, especially in towns and 
cities, once again featured high on the mobility agenda for both 
the general public and academia. Our film “Urban Mobility 2030” 
helped us refine our strategic appreciation of the challenges posed 
by urban mobility and the various potential solutions, and to open 
it up for debate – for example at DRIVE, the Volkswagen Group 
Forum in Berlin. 
Since 2013, Volkswagen has been collaborating with 14 other 
companies from various industries on the Sustainable Mobility 2.0 
project launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD). A sustainable approach to future urban 
mobility needs a credible definition of what the word “sustainable” 
actually means, and a way of measuring current and future solu-
tions against this yardstick. Using scientific criteria, a catalog of –  
at the last count – 19 indicators has been developed and trialed in 
six model cities around the world. In return, each of the partici-
pating cities is given a sustainability profile, while a database of 
solutions also developed as part of the project reveals the most 
effective measures for each indicator. In the spring of 2016, the 
European Commission announced that it would actively support 
the use of these indicators in cities.
Research Projects
It is also important to produce reliable forecasts of the potential 
impacts of future solutions on urban air quality, noise pollution or 
traffic flow (impact assessment). This is where models and simu-
lations make an important contribution, because many solutions 
– such as dial-a-bus systems – only exert appreciable influence once 
they have achieved a certain market penetration. Building on these 
results, it is then possible to develop or optimize the right solutions 
 for the future with much greater exactitude.
In parallel with the ongoing automation of driving functions, innova-
tive methods for identifying situations and using them to calculate 
traffic-efficient driving strategies are gaining in importance. We are  
further expanding our research activities in these areas in order to 
make the most of the limited road area in the vicinity of urban junc-
tions and other sensitive nodes in the traffic system.
More and more of us live in cities. Traffic noise impairs our quality 
of life, and is produced by many different means of transport. At 
Volkswagen, we are very aware of our responsibilities as a manu-
facturer of one of those means of transport in particular – the auto-
mobile – and are working intensively on ways to steadily reduce 
noise emissions from individual vehicles. In these efforts to reduce 
noise, Volkswagen is even going one step further. We are using a 
specially developed tool to calculate noise pollution levels in cities 
and further develop our understanding of the role of the car, assess 
interactions between different noise sources, and evaluate various 
measures for reducing noise. Our aim is to improve the noise situa-
tion for urban residents in general by entering into dialog with 
cities and fellow noise emitters.

Volkswagen AG supported the INEES research project by providing 20 VW e-up! cars. VW e-up! energy consumption in 
kWh/100 km: 11.7 (combined); Co2 emissions in g/km: 0 (combined); efficiency rating: A+
Drivers of the Audi A3 Sportback g-tron can become almost 
entirely carbon-neutral, thanks to the Audi e-gas fuel card. 
Audi records the amount of gas each customer purchases 
with the card, and ensures that exactly the same quantity of 
synthetically produced, renewable Audi e-gas is fed into the 
German natural-gas network to compensate. The e-gas is 
produced by the world’s largest industrial power-to-gas plant 
on the grid, which uses a chemical process based on wind 
power, CO2 and water to generate synthetic methane, effec-
tively “storing” green electricity in the existing natural-gas 
network. In 2015, following a successful test sequence, the 
plant qualified to participate in the balancing energy market. 
Thus the effects of the Audi e-gas project extend well beyond 
the automotive industry.

Of course smart mobility also includes providing solutions for 
our own employees at Volkswagen sites with what we call 
“mobility management”. This includes, but is not limited to, 
cars and parking spaces. Examples include cycling campaigns, 
shuttle-bus services, season tickets for public transport, 
the provision of ridesharing apps, and parking spaces for 
carpools.
MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AT OUR SITES
MOBILITY SERVICES
Mobility Solutions is one of the four cornerstones of our new  
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025. 
In future, the Group plans to invest in carsharing, robotaxis and 
transport-on-demand initiatives. The strategic partnership with 
on-demand mobility company GETT is one such initiative, aimed at 
expanding the Group’s Mobility Solutions portfolio. 
With the rapid expansion of Internet commerce, the number of 
packages being delivered in towns and cities is rising sharply, result-
ing in escalating traffic volumes. If deliveries fail because there is  
no-one to accept the delivery, this is a negative outcome for all par-
ties involved – but also for the environment. Consequently, we aim 
to create synergies between passenger and goods transportation by 
devising new logistics concepts that avoid unnecessary journeys. 
One possible solution, developed in cooperation between Audi and 
Group Research, is the so-called “parcel car”. In the era of networked 
vehicles, a car boot (trunk) becomes a mobile delivery address to 
which logistics service providers can gain keyless access. Thanks to 
this temporary access authorization, by the time the recipient leaves 
work, the package is already safely in their car boot. Audi AG is joint-
ly testing this solution – dubbed “Audi connect easy delivery” – with  
DHl Paket and Amazon in Munich, and is preparing to launch it with 
a view to making the concept available to all Group vehicles in the 
future.
Eco-friendly Driving
Regardless of model or brand, alongside the development of ever 
more efficient vehicles, eco-friendly driving habits are a major factor 
in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, not to mention 
noise and pollutant emissions. With this in mind, we support our 
customers by offering a range of courses:  
 § Customers can also book “Think Blue. Eco-Training.” courses  
directly with Volkswagen in Germany, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
 § Plenty of fuel-saving hints and tips are provided in dedicated 
brochures and car manuals

“Think Blue. Trainer.” is a driver assistance program offering 
vital information on current fuel consumption during journeys 
as a way of encouraging eco-friendlier driving habits. It already 
features in the e-up! and up! models with conventional power-
trains, as well as the Polo and Passat, and will gradually be 
rolled out to other models. The range of functions offered by the 
“Think Blue. Trainer.” program can be further extended with the 
“Volkswagen Car-Net Think Blue. Trainer.” app, which communi-
cates with the vehicle and can be operated via the infotainment 
system. The app also contains training challenges for additional 
motivation. All trips are automatically stored, and can be used 
later for cross-comparison.
SAVE FUEL WITH “THINK BLUE. TRAINER.”
In 2013, Volkswagen Financial Services, together with its 
partner Pon Holdings B.V., acquired a stake in market-leading 
Dutch carsharing company Collect Car B.V., better known as 
Greenwheels.

SCANIA ECOLUTION
Ecolution by Scania combines our tailored products with driver 
services. Based on continuous customer dialogue, the common 
goal is improved fuel efficiency. Through optimized vehicle 
specifications, performance diagnostics, driver training and 
monthly follow-ups, our results show an average 10% reduction 
in fuel consumption.
SCANIA FUEL MASTERS
 
Scania Fuel Masters, a new interactive competition site that 
Scania launched in October 2015, allows drivers to compare their 
most fuel-efficient journeys with each other via their mobile 
phones.
Audi Mobility Services
Audi offers three innovative carsharing services: Audi shared fleet, 
Audi select and Audi on demand.
With Audi shared fleet, companies can customize their own corpo-
rate fleets. Depending on the individual arrangement, Audi takes 
care of the on-site implementation and maintenance of the cor-
porate vehicle fleet – from supplying carpool vehicles to regularly 
servicing, fueling and cleaning them. The highlight: employees can 
use the pool vehicles for business and private trips. This increases 
employees’ mobility – even after regular working hours – and can 
be used as an additional incentive by employers. Even better, Audi 
shared fleet enhances fleet utilization and cost efficiency. 
The Audi select service targets private individuals and corporate 
customers alike. Over a 12-month period, customers can drive three 
different Audi models – and for six months, choose a Ducati as well. 
A premium pool of low-mileage, well-equipped second-hand cars is 
available for this service.
Audi on demand is a mobility service that gives customers flexible 
access to premium mobility. Whether for spontaneous short adven-
tures or longer business trips, customers can book the right Audi 
online; cars are available in a matter of minutes. Munich Airport is 
the first Audi on demand location in Germany. 
PRODUCT COMMUNICATION
Alongside the development of ever more fuel-efficient new models, 
the Volkswagen Group boasts a wide range of other offerings for 
eco-friendly mobility. Our product communications spotlight partic-
ularly efficient vehicles and low-carbon technologies by awarding 
them efficiency badges, and report on the environmental progress 
new models have made over their predecessors by means of life 
Cycle Assessments and Environmental Commendations.
Porsche has also launched a sustainability initiative to support 
dealers, aimed at improving the energy efficiency of existing Porsche 
Centers and ensuring that new centers are made as energy-efficient 
as possible.

RECYCLING
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ impact 
on the environment and conserving resources. This is not just about 
recycling vehicles at the end of their service life; recycling starts 
at the new-vehicle development stage, during which we pay close 
attention to the recyclability of the required materials, the use of 
high-quality recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants. At 
the same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, for instance 
the treatment and disposal of service fluids or high-wear compo-
nents.
Volkswagen is also constantly working on developing and enhancing 
recycling methods, processes and technologies. We have developed 
a multi-award-winning process, VW-SiCon, that allows end-of-life 
vehicles to be 85% recycled and 95% recovered. This complies with 
the regulatory requirements that have been in force in the EU since 
the beginning of the reporting period. With our partners, we are de-
veloping modern technologies for recycling components from elec-
tric vehicles in two research projects: lithoRec (lithium-ion battery 
recycling) and ElmoRel (electric vehicle recycling – key components 
in power electronics).
Audi also presented a pilot project for the reuse of traction batteries 
from e-tron models, which could significantly extend the useful 
life of lithium-ion batteries and substantially improve the environ-
mental impact and cost-effectiveness of vehicles with electric 
powertrains. Giving batteries a second lease of life by using them 
as stationary accumulators makes an important contribution to the 
transition to renewable energy sources.
last but not least, we should mention the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars Genuine Exchange Parts program. Our industrial reconditioning 
produces high-quality exchange parts that conserve resources and 
offer the same quality, functionality and warranty as the correspond-
ing new parts while being on average 40% cheaper.  
MAN Truck & Bus professionally remanufactures used parts for 
use in vehicle repairs under the “MAN Original Teile® ecoline” 
brand. The range includes more than 3,000 items. This helps con-
serve resources, save energy, and cut costs by an average of 30%. 
We also offer customers in most areas of Europe an extensive 
portfolio of replacement and spare parts.

there is still room for improvement. The charts and figures are therefore followed by a presentation of our goals and an 
estimation of the extent to which those goals have been achieved.
Sustainable through an through
G4-17
The Volkswagen Group is committed to sustainable, transparent and 
responsible corporate governance.The principles of our sustainability 
management are described in detail in the Strategy chapter, as are 
our continuous improvement goals. Our goals and actions, together 
with planned activities and current status, are presented in greater 
detail at the end of this chapter. 
The chapter Guidelines and Principles provide an overview of the 
Group-wide principles, agreements and methods that form the basis 
for our shared understanding of sustainability across the Group, 
allowing performance to be measured, controlled and improved.
MANAGEMENT BY KEY INDICATORS
In order to manage its sustainability performance, the Volkswa-
gen Group collects central performance indicators in line with the 
requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the ESG 
(Environment, Social, Governance) indicator framework of the Euro-
pean Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS). Increasingly, 
shareholders and investors demand transparency, and this makes 
them an important target group for our sustainability reporting. 
In recognition of this, we provide an overview of our economic, 
environmental and social performance in the following chapters 
on Financial Indicators, Environmental Indicators and Personnel 
Indicators. The overview is as comprehensive as possible and stated 
in quantitative terms.
The key indicators we present are a continuation of those from 
previous years. There have been no changes in the methods used to 
report and measure our sustainability performance. The Volkswagen 
Group’s global production network comprised 120 production loca-
tions at the end of the reporting year. This is now the fourth time we 
have reported our emissions in line with Scope 3 of the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol (GHG), which makes us one of the trailblazers in our 
industry.
Frame of Reference  
 
G4-17, G4-22, G4-23
In general, the indicators relate to the entire Group, including any 
companies in which our equity interest exceeds 50%. For our joint 
ventures in China, we report social indicators “at equity”, in other 
words at 50%, but including 100% of environmentally relevant 
data. However, due to differing definitions or collection methods, 
it is not yet possible to consolidate the data reported by the brands 
and regions in all areas, which means that there are still numerous 
exceptions. In this report indicators which are only relate to parts of 
the Group are marked with footnotes and explaining which parts. 
Over the coming years, we will continue to endeavor to make data 
collection uniform across all locations and companies.
AUDITING AND STANDARDS
The Volkswagen Group Sustainability Report 2016 has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaft (PwC) against the relevant requirements and criteria 
laid down in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the 
Global Reporting Initiative, taking supplementary account of the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised). The audit activities carried out by PwC include: man-
agement surveys, surveys of employees responsible for reporting 
sustainability information, and recording of the processes used 
to collect, calculate and report sustainability information. In the 
following Indicators chapters, the quantitative details of the 2016 
reporting period audited by PwC are marked with the symbol

Environmental Indicators 
As in previous years we are also reporting important environmental key figures of production for the year under review 2016. 
Selected environmental data of the Volkswagen Group are presented here in aggregate form. The data are determined, checked and released  
to the production locations on the basis of a group-internal standard (VW standard 98 000). In order to increase the degree of precision and  
the consistency of the information gained, the gathering of the environment-relevant consumption and emission data is subject to a continu-
ous improvement process. This applies in particular to that information that has to be determined with the aid of special calculation algorithms. 
Furthermore, the values for the December of the past year can contain an estimated portion if for instance it is based on settlements from 
energy suppliers or waste removers, that at the time of the data gathering were not available. These estimated portions will be replaced at the 
next data collection by the then known December values.
In analogy to the company-internal environmental strategy enforcement, the time series depicted refer to the base year 2010. The current 
year under review and the corresponding previous year complete the reporting period. 
In total, the environmental data from the production locations are being collected. In addition, starting from the data year 2016 the produc-
tion locations of Września (Volkswagen Poznań Sp..z o.o.), Września (SITECH Sp. z o.o.), San josé Chiapa (Audi México S.A. de C.V) and Amphur 
Pluakdaeng Rayong (Ducati Motor (Thailand) Co. ltd.) were included in the collection. 
The data from the category “Private and light commercial vehicles” for the years 2010, 2015 and 2016 are reported as in the Volkswagen 
annual report. The data of the brands Scania AB, MAN SE, Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. and the VW Kraftwerk GmbH are reported in the  
category “Other group divisions”. The respective proportions are presented differentiated in the charts. If not reported otherwise, all producing 
locations of the Group as well as the power plants and boiler houses operated by Volkswagen AG at the Wolfsburg, Kassel and Hanover 
locations are taken into account.  
However, only 112 of the 120 Group production locations are included in the coverage of the data. No data is available for the seven Regional 
Product Centres of Scania or for the Bangalore location of MAN. These correspond to approx. 0.15% of the employees of the producing loca-
tions and thus have no relevant influence on the key figures of the Group. 
The Volkswagen Group is essentially an automotive manufacturer that produces private and light commercial vehicles as well as heavy 
commercial vehicles and buses. But in the MAN SE marine propulsion engines and power plant components are also produced. Due to this 
product diversity the overall environmental impacts cannot summarily refer to the production quantity of the vehicles. For this reason the 
presentation of the relative key figures occurs only for the category “Private and light commercial vehicles”. Their production quantity in the 
year 2016 came to 10,219,025 vehicles. In addition, 186,067 heavy commercial vehicles were produced. 
The changing production quantities and the associated changes in the utilization of the locations are reflected in the changes to the absolute 
values of many indicators. An improvement of specific values could be achieved for some indicators through measures to increase efficiency.
Relevant, but not able to be influenced, are the weather-related influences on the consumption of resources.  This above all impacts the room 
heating requirements, both for the production sites and for the indirect sectors of production since the annual mean temperatures have  
an impact on the direct consumption of energy sources and of externally procured energy quantities.
The specific values are thus influenced by various aspects. On the one hand the absolute consumption or emissions can change, on the other 
rising or falling production quantities at the individual production locations influence the key figure trends.

The total energy consumption since 2010 has risen due to the con-
tinuous increase in the production quantity. 
The consumption of electrical energy has also risen in comparison to 
2010. The electrical energy consumption per vehicle could be reduced 
since 2010 through measures to increase efficiency. 
The heat consumption is divided into the room heat requirements 
for the heating of production plants and their indirect sectors  
and into the room heat requirements that are used for technical 
processes. Since the room heat is the greater share of the total heat 
requirements, the development of the total heat requirements is 
strongly influenced by the course of weather conditions. 
Various initiatives coupled with reduced heating demand have 
caused specific heat consumption per vehicle to fall since 2010.
The already named effects due to a colder weather phase and an in-
crease in production quantity lead to a rise in the absolute consump-
tion of fuel gas for production processes. Also associated with this is 
a slight worsening in the specific value per vehicle.

FACTS AND FIGurES    ENVIRONMENTAl INDICATORS 
Despite the recording of new production locations and of the asso-
ciated increased energy consumption, the direct CO2 emissions in 
the category private and light commercial vehicles and in the entire 
Group are on the decline since 2010.
The direct CO2 emissions are coupled with the burning of fossil fuels, 
whose use could be reduced. A reduction in the direct CO2 emissions 
per vehicle is also to be noted with the reduction in the absolute 
emissions quantity. 
Not taken into account are the direct CO2 emissions of the official 
works vehicles. Work is currently being done on the worldwide uni-
form recording of emissions of the official works vehicles fleet. Initial 
calculations for the Volkswagen Germany control volume indicate 
an increase in the total CO2 emissions of 3.4% in the control volume 
investigated.

Starting in 2010, due to the increases in consumption for electrical 
energy, heat and fuel gas for production, the overall CO2 emissions 
rose. The CO2 emissions per vehicle rose minimally from 2015 to 
2016, but could be dramatically reduced since 2010.
Via the valuation of the energy and heat consumption of the pro-
duction locations with suitable CO2 emission factors, the CO2 emis-
sions generated by the power plants and boiler houses operated by 
Volkswagen AG – from the electricity and heat generation for the 
production locations of Volkswagen AG – also flow into the overall 
quantity of CO2 emissions. Due to the changed CO2 emission fac-
tors from this energy generation, it came to a rise in the absolute 
and the specific total CO2 emissions compared to the previous year.
As a special feature in the region of China, starting in 2013 CO2 
factors are being used due to external specifications that do not 
reflect the rising share of renewable energies.
Not included in the presentations of the CO2 emissions are the 
emissions that come about due to the power plants operated by 
Volkswagen AG as district heating and electricity delivery to third 
parties. For 2016 this is 374,118 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

FACTS AND FIGurES    ENVIRONMENTAl INDICATORS 
The determination of CO2 equivalents is based on calculations on 
the basis of specific global warming potential for the most frequent-
ly emitted refrigerants and greenhouse gases. Since these emissions 
do not appear continuously, it can come to larger fluctuations in a 
time series. However, these emissions have no significant influence 
on the CO2 emissions of the Group.
GHG emissions (Scope 3)
in the Volkswagen Group (cars and light commercial vehicles)
In agreement with the Scope 3 Standards published with the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the 
World Resources Institute, Volkswagen reports CO2 emissions on 
twelve of in total 15 Scope 3 categories, whereby we count among 
the world’s leading companies. The calculations have yielded that in 
the emission categories of “Purchased goods and services” and “Use 
phase” approx. 92% of the entire Scope 3 volume is accrued. The 
calculation of CO2 emissions in the use phase is based on a Group 
fleet value, which represents the global vehicle inventory in the four 
large regions (EU28, USA, Brazil, China). In order to get as complete 
a picture as possible, Volkswagen also records the emissions in this 
category that are accrued during manufacture and the transport of 
fuels (well to tank).

CO2 emission  
of the Volkswagen Group’s European (EU 28) New Passenger Car Fleet  
in g/km
The EU private-vehicle new-car fleet of the Volkswagen Group (ex-
cluding lamborghini and Bentley) in the year under review emitted 
on average 120g CO2/km, thus falling under the European ambient 
standard for 2015 of 130g CO2/km by 9.6g and almost reaching  
its own objective of 120g. The lamborghini and Bentley brands each 
own an independent fleet within the context of the European CO2 
legislation and have also adhered to their individual target values. 
The fleet value in the USA is at 162g CO2/km, in China at 153g CO2/
km and in Brazil at 131g CO2/km.

The painting processes are primarily responsible for the VOC emis-
sions.  In modern painting plants paints and process materials are 
used that contain lower quantities of solvents. Plus, measures are 
taken in the painting processes to capture or eliminate emitted 
solvents. The process used the most is thermal afterburning the 
exhaust air which is downstream from the actual painting process. 
The ascertainment of emissions into the environment is based both 
on metrological analyses as well as on calculations. 
Despite a rise in vehicle production since 2010 and the associated  
greater paint volume, it came to a reduction in the absolute 
VOC emissions. It was possible to dramatically reduce the emissions 
per vehicle.

Due to the rise in production quantity compared to 2010 in the 
category of private and light commercial vehicles, the entire amount 
of dangerous and non-dangerous wastes generated also rose. The 
share of waste for removal contained in this category could be re-
duced from approx. 34% in 2010 to approx. 21% in 2016. In contrast 
the share of waste for recycling increased from approx. 66% in 2010 
to approx. 79% in 2016. The increase in the share of recyclable waste 
is also the result of the waste strategy established in the Group that 
has a higher recycling ratio of waste as its goal. 
The absolute quantity of metallic “wastes”, which due to their 
complete recycling potential and due to the returns achieved from 
their sale are viewed internally as so-called “resources”, has risen 
over the entire reporting period since 2010. The reason for this was 
the Group-wide increase in production. When considering all wastes, 
including the metallic wastes, the recovery rate lies at approx. 95%.
In the past year under review due to the operation of energy genera-
tion plants by the Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH, power plant residues 
in the amount of approx. 145,000 tonnes has been allocated to 
recycling.

With the increase in the number of private and light commercial ve-
hicles produced, the total consumption of fresh water has also risen 
in recent years. This increase in consumption is due to the integra-
tion of new locations into the reporting. Despite the rise in the num-
ber of Group locations, it was possible to continuously decrease the 
fresh-water consumption per vehicle in the reporting period since 
2010. This was achieved through a variety of recycling measures and 
the introduction of production procedures requiring little water. 
The quantity of wastewater accrued shows a similar pattern to that 
of the fresh water. Due to evaporative losses in the cooling towers 
and in the production process there are quantity differences be-
tween fresh and wastewater. The quantity of wastewater per private 
and light commercial vehicle produced could also be lowered.

Depending on the location of the wastewater purification system, 
locations are differentiated as follows: as an indirect discharger 
those where the wastewater is discharged into the municipal sew-
age collection system for further cleaning, and as a direct discharger 
those that operate their own wastewater treatment system, there-
by discharging the cleaned wastewater directly into a body of water.
A clear decline in the absolute NOx values as well as in the NOx emis-
sions is to be recorded per vehicle in the category of private and light 
commercial vehicles in the period from 2010 to 2016.
The strong decline in the direct SO2 emissions since the year 2010  
is a result of changes in the positions regarding ownership in a 
power- generation plant and the replacement of coal as the fuel.

mental protection measures are separate plants separated from the 
remaining production process. They can be up- or downstream from 
the production process. In contrast to the end-of-pipe environmental 
protection measures, the integrated measures already reduce the 
environmental impact during the production phase of the product. 
The reported operating costs solely concern production-related envi-
ronmental protection measures that protect the environment from 
damaging influences by avoiding, reducing or removing emissions 
from the company. This includes, for instance, expenditures for the 
operation of plants that serve to protect the environment as well as 
expenditures for the plant-related measures.

FUNDAMENTALS
This report was drawn up in accordance with the fourth generation of 
guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G4) with the aid 
of an IT system that, in addition to Group-wide data acquisition and 
management, will also be used for stakeholder management within 
the Group. In terms of content, important guidance was provided by 
the questionnaires and appraisals of sustainability-oriented rating 
agencies and RobecoSAM in particular. We also took our lead from 
Stakeholder Engagement Standard AA1000.
To identify material topics for the Volkswagen Group resulting from 
various global challenges, we drew upon the findings of the Volks-
wagen Group’s Stakeholder Panel which has been in place for many 
years now, as well as the results of the latest comprehensive stake-
holder surveys conducted by Group companies Audi, MAN, Porsche 
and Volkswagen Financial Services. 
The resultant materiality matrix (see “Our Approach”) was validated 
by the Corporate CSR & Sustainability Steering Group. 
The present report takes account not only of the recommendations 
of the Stakeholder Panel following the latter’s evaluation of the 2014 
Group Sustainability Report (see “Stakeholder Management”).
STANDARDS
The present sustainability report takes account of the G4 reporting 
guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in line with  
the “Comprehensive” option. At the same time, we set out in our  
GRI Content Index available online how we implement the require-
ments of the United Nations Global Compact (UN GC) and of the 
German Sustainability Code (GSC). The statements and references 
that appear in the index relate to the 2016 business year (january 1 
to December 31, 2016). Selected information were reviewed by 
auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaft. (see “here”). The GRI has confirmed the location of 
indicators G4-17 to G4-27 through its Materiality Disclosure Service. 
The Volkswagen Group’s Sustainability Report has been published every year since 2011; this year is the second time that the report 
has been published exclusively online. In addition to information about the Group’s sustainability activities in the 2016 financial year 
(january 1 to December 31, 2016), the report also contains selected information from the 2017 financial year. The editorial content was 
finalized on April 12, 2017. The report is available in German and English. We anticipate that the next Group Sustainability Report (for 
2017) will be published in the second quarter of 2018.
The Strategy chapter presents the fundamentals of the Group’s strategy for implementing sustainable development across all its brands. 
 Primarily, we discuss the Group’s new future program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, which was presented at the Group’s Annual General Meet-
ing on june 22, 2016 and had been further specified at the Annual Media Conference and Investor Conference 2017 on March 14, 2017.
The Economy, People and Environment chapters set out our management approach in each case, before outlining how the various aspects 
of these topics are implemented. The key Group-wide indicators and the overarching corporate sustainability roadmap are described in 
the Facts and Figures chapter. 
True to the character of a progress report, we aim to focus on the essentials while at the same time communicating a balanced picture of 
our activities that takes account of all Group brands and companies. Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania and ŠKODA publish their own sustain-
ability reports, either annually or at two-year intervals.

Independent Practitioner’s  
Limited Assurance Report
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement 
on the sustainability information marked with 
 in the online 
version of the Sustainability Report* of the Volkswagen AG, Wolfs-
burg (hereafter the “Company”), for the period from january 1st to 
December 31st, 2016.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the cri-
teria as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereafter the “GRI-Criteria”) and for 
the selection of the information to be assessed. 
This responsibility includes the selection and application of ap-
propriate methods to prepare the Sustainability Report as well as 
the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability 
disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, 
the responsibility includes designing, implementing and main-
taining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the 
Sustainability Report, which is free of material misstatements due to 
intentional or unintentional errors.
AUDIT FIRM’S INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
We have complied with the German professional provisions regard-
ing independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and profes-
sional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German 
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für 
Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well 
as the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (“Institute of Public Auditors 
in Germany; IDW”): Requirements to quality control for audit firms 
(“Entwurf eines IdW Qualitätssicherungsstandards 1 „Anforderun-
gen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis“ (IdW 
EQS 1)”) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system 
of quality control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional stan-
dards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability 
information marked with 
 in the Sustainability Report based on 
our work performed. 
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on 
external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the 
Sustainability Report. 
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Stan-
dard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial In-
formation” published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan 
and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance 
whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to 
believe that the sustainability information marked with 
 in the 
Sustainability Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the GRI-Criteria. In a limited assurance engage-
ment the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for 
a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less 
assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. 
The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement. 
This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements 
of the sustainability information marked with 
 in the Sustainabili-
ty Report with regard to the GRI-Criteria. 
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the 
following procedures:
 § Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability 
organization and of stakeholder engagement 
 § Inspection of relevant documents and inquiries of personnel 
regarding the further development of the materiality process and 
the preparation of the materiality matrix as well as the underlying 
internal control system

Bringing the Future to  
Series Production
The TRANSFORM 2025+ strategy is a comprehensive redefinition  
of the Volkswagen brand. The new strategy focuses on clearer brand 
positioning across the various regions and segments, backed by 
significant improvements in efficiency and productivity. At the same 
time, the brand is investing in electric mobility and connectivity. The 
“pact for the future” will make the Volkswagen brand more compet-
itive, getting it into shape for the future. It lays the foundation for 
the company’s transformation from an automotive manufacturer 
into a successful mobility services provider. In 2016, the I.D. concept 
vehicle and the BUDD-e both captured the world’s attention. Both 
concepts are based on the Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) 
platform for electric vehicles. The brand also celebrated the Golf GTi’s 
40th birthday.

Think Blue. Factory.
The Volkswagen brand has taken a significant step toward environmen-
tally sustainable production. Manufacturing of vehicles and components 
at its production facilities around the world is 25% more environmentally 
friendly today than it was five years ago. This means that the brand has hit 
the ambitious sustainability target it set for itself three years earlier than 
planned.
Volkswagen’s “Think Blue. Factory” environmental program was the first of 
its kind in the world of auto manufacturing. And the reduction in environmental impact – the exact figure 
is 29.2% – is based on the average value of the Volkswagen brand’s five agreed environmental indicators. 
Between 2010 and the end of 2016, energy consumption was cut by 23.5%, while Co2 emissions were 
reduced by 28.6%. The volume of waste for disposal was slashed by an impressive 58.6%; water and solvent 
consumption had already been reduced by 27.5% and 7.6% respectively. The indicators are measured per 
unit of production (finished vehicle or component).

OTHER SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS
Volunteering is a badge of honor at Volkswagen.  
Volkswagen’s strategic initiative “Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt” is the umbrella program for volunteering activities, providing targeted 
support for social engagement opportunities. Since 2007, a specialist office embedded in the company’s Hr management function 
has matched over 2,800 volunteers with suitable projects through a volunteer exchange. Around Germany, some 25,000 employees 
are now involved in associations, organizations and charities alongside their work. Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt recognizes their commit-
ment, providing support and additional backing. By highlighting positive role models, the company also encourages other employees 
to engage in voluntary activities.
our employees’ commitment to these causes not only benefits other people, initiatives and facilities, but also strengthens their own 
key skills, especially their specialist and social skills, as well as their ability to work in a close-knit team. Thus the program dovetails 
with Volkswagen’s own personal and professional development initiatives.
Employees who wish to tackle new challenges once their active careers with Volkswagen have come to an end are supported by our 
in-house Senior Expert Scheme (KiSEE). This program gives them the opportunity to use their expertise at regional or global level, 
either as experienced experts within the company, or as volunteer supporters in outside organizations. In 2016, more than 280 senior 
experts took part in projects of their choosing, ensuring that their vast pool of expert knowledge was put to good use, and encourag-
ing the sharing of valuable expertise between old and new generations.

For Audi, corporate responsibility means taking account of economic, ecological and social factors in all decision- 
making, with the aim of securing a long-term competitive edge. In 2016, with our Strategy 2025 we focused on three 
major trends: Digitalization, Sustainability and urbanization. This strategy is Audi’s roadmap for the future. We are 
 pursuing the mission of increasing the sustainability of our vehicles and services along the entire value chain. In addi-
tion to our commitment to new drive technologies, we are also investing in carbon-neutral fuels – Audi e-fuels. We 
will continue to cut our production’s environmental footprint, while working on material cycles that leave no room for 
waste. And our demand for sustainability will feed into our supply chain. We have defined specific targets for each of 
these issues in Strategy 2025.

Key technology for an electric mobility breakthrough
Fast and simple battery charging – including charging on the go – is a key 
requirement for achieving a breakthrough in electric mobility. With its partners 
in the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) e.V., Audi is supporting common 
technical standards in the form of the Combined Charging System (CCS). The 
Combined Charging System (CCS) makes it possible to charge electric cars 
with alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) using a standardized 
charging interface known as the Combo plug. This technology is already fitted 
on the electrically powered Audi e-tron quattro concept car, which is capable 
of traveling more than 400 km on a 30-minute charge. That increases to over 
500 km if the battery is charged to full capacity.
Piloted Driving is Safer Driving 
Around 90% of all accidents are due to human error. Audi already offers an ex-
tensive range of driver assistance systems to help individuals drive more safely 
and efficiently.  In the new Audi A4, for example, intelligent driver assistance 
systems keep drivers safe when turning across traffic at intersections, help with 
evasive maneuvers in potential accident situations, warn of cross-traffic when 
reversing, provide parking assistance and ensure that occupants do not over-
look approaching traffic when exiting from the vehicle. In the near future, Audi 
will also implement highly automated driving technologies. This will mean that 
in certain situations, the car will – for the first time – be able to take full control 
of the driving process. Audi refers to this as “piloted driving”. The next genera-
tion of the Audi A8 will feature piloted driving in stop-go traffic on motorways 
at speeds of up to 60 km/h. Audi has further expanded its expertise in the 
development of piloted driving with the “Digital Motorway Test Bed” initiative.  
The premium carmaker is testing new technologies for piloted driving and 
car-to-x communication, as well as safety and usability features, in real-world 
traffic conditions on the A9 motorway between Nuremberg and Munich. The 
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication project connects cars to smart 
traffic signs that can update to indicate speed limits, traffic jams or road blocks.
Audi e-tron quattro concept: sporty, efficient, practical
With the Audi e-tron quattro concept, Audi is demonstrating how far its 
electrification strategy has already advanced. Three electric motors with a 
combined output of up to 370 kW provide quattro four-wheel drive and electric 
torque vectoring, which distributes the drive power between the rear wheels 
as required. At a 150 kW DC fast charging station, it only takes around 50 
minutes to charge the battery for a total range of more than 500 kilometers. 
But the concept model is also equipped with Audi Wireless Charging (AWC), an 
alternative approach that uses inductive (contactless) charging. This charging 
method could not be more convenient – for example, maneuvering the Audi 
e-tron quattro concept into the correct position over the charging pad can be 
left to the piloted parking system. And provided the sun is shining, the large 
solar roof supplies extra charging power. At speeds of 80 km/h and more, elec-
trically controlled aerodynamic aids on the hood, sides and rear of the vehicle 
improve airflow by directing air through and around the vehicle as required. 
Vertical spoilers on the side panels and the fully enclosed floor pan with newly 
designed microstructures make a further contribution to reduced drag.

The Brand 
from Central Europe
With over 120 years of vehicle manufacturing experience, ŠKODA 
AUTO is the largest industrial company in the Czech Republic and 
the third oldest car manufacturer in the world. In 1991, ŠKODA AUTO 
was the fourth brand to be incorporated into the Volkswagen Group, 
when it was positioned as the Group’s entry-level brand. Since then, 
production has increased more than six-fold. Today, ŠKODA AUTO 
operates three production plants in the Czech Republic and one in 
India. ŠKODA vehicles are also produced in China, Russia, the Slovak 
 Republic, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
ŠKODA AUTO currently generates about 8% of the Czech Republic’s 
total exports, supplying vehicles to over 100 countries on five con-
tinents. Its product portfolio comprises models in all categories. 
The seven-model series meet virtually all customer needs. Each 
model has its own unique positioning and interprets the ŠKODA 
brand pledge differently for each of its target groups and market 
segments, from the ŠKODA CITIGO city car and the small ŠKODA 
FABIA to the compact ŠKODA RAPID and the ŠKODA OCTAVIA in the 
family compact class; from the ŠKODA yETI off-roader through to  
the ŠKODA SUPERB at the high end of the model range, as well as 
the brand’s new large SUV, the ŠKODA KODIAQ, first presented to  
the public in September 2016.
2016 marked the fifth year of the ŠKODA AUTO growth strategy, 
with 1,126,477 cars sold worldwide. ŠKODA’s European market  
share remained above 4%, while China maintained its position as 
the brand’s strongest market with 317,088 cars sold – an increase  
of 12.6% over 2015. 
In recent years, ŠKODA AUTO has regularly featured at the top of the 
“Czech 100 Best” rankings in the “Most Important Company” and

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2016
Millions Donated to Good Causes
In 2016, ŠKoDA employees raised more than two million Czech koru-
na for NGo projects that were selected by the employees themselves. 
The company’s fund-matching donation doubled this figure, bringing 
it to four million koruna. In line with ŠKoDA’s CSr priorities, most of 
the money went into supporting charitable projects for children, ed-
ucation, barrier-free access for the disabled, and road safety. A certain 
amount of money was donated to a children’s home in Aurangabad, 
India, as part of ŠKoDA AuTo’s international aid initiative. 
Teribear Charity Runs 
In 2016, ŠKoDA sponsored the Tereza Maxová Children’s Foundation’s 
“Teribear charity runs”. Every kilometer in the 10-day “Teribear moves 
prague” event and the one-day “Teribear moves Mladá Boleslav” event 
raised money for disadvantaged children. runners in the prague event 
ran day and night, with event partners donating various amounts in 
Czech koruna per kilometer for projects to support children in need. A 
total of 9,456 people took part, covering a distance of 159,348.75 kilo-
meters overall and raising more than 8 million koruna. The Mladá 
Boleslav run on behalf of Nymburk Children’s Home involved a large 
number of ŠKoDA employees, as well as members of the general pub-
lic. During the one-day event, more than 1,687 people covered a total 
distance of 14,426.4 km, raising almost 300,000 koruna.

OTHER PROJECTS 
Half a Million Trees for the Czech Republic
As part of ŠKoDA’s long-term “A tree for every car sold in the Czech republic” project, the company planted more than 640,000 trees in 
some 50 locations between 2007 and the end of 2016. Trees are planted for the benefit of towns and communities throughout the Czech 
republic. The project focuses in particular on the regions in which ŠKoDA has production facilities. From the start, employees at ŠKoDA 
production sites have been actively involved in implementing the campaign. They assist in the search for suitable locations, as well as 
with the actual planting. From the outset, one of the initiative’s key objectives was to strengthen the bonds between employees and the 
areas in which they live and work by encouraging active involvement.
ŠKODA Academy
The ŠKoDA Academy comprises three main parts – an adult training program, a vocational school, and an employee potential assess-
ment center. The adult training program is designed to foster the personal development of ŠKoDA AuTo employees, as well as broaden 
and improve their technical and interdisciplinary skills. 31,948 participants took part in off-the-job adult training courses in 2016, and 
61,291 participated in eLearning courses. ŠKoDA AuTo’s vocational students regularly rank among the best in national and international 
competitions. Students are invited to enhance their skills in the so-called Apprentice Car project, in which they are asked to build their 
own prototype car. under the guidance of professional ŠKoDA designers, the project was launched in 2013. In 2016, the students’ team-
work resulted in a car named ATEro, based on a ŠKoDA rApID and equipped with a variety of amazing special features. The vocational 
school offered 14 courses in IT mechatronics, logistics, auto mechanics, electrical engineering and tooling, including a special course for 
disabled apprentices. The courses were attended by 911 full-time students.
Z. E. B. R. A. Idea Management
ŠKoDA AuTo has implemented the so-called Z. E. B. r. A. idea management program, a motivational program dedicated to supporting 
employee activities that aim to introduce improvements or innovative cost-saving measures. Since the program was launched in 2010, 
the number of proposals submitted has increased from 11,620 to around 26,000 in 2016, generating total savings of 302.4 million 
koruna. Z. E. B. r. A. has thus become a powerful tool under the management of ŠKoDA’s “Suggestions Centre”. 
Healthcare – Focus on Prevention
The ŠKoDA polyclinic, located at the main plant in Mladá Boleslav, provides outpatient medical care for both employees and the 
general public. The range of care provided includes general medicine, cardiology, dentistry, dermatology, ENT, gynecology, internal 
medicine, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, pulmonology, sonography, surgery, urology and X-ray diagnostics.
ŠKoDA employees can participate in the prevention programs free of charge. These include individual and group training sessions 
aimed at preventing health problems resulting from workplace or lifestyle factors. In the reporting year, a number of ergonomic 
interventions were implemented. The company also continued to carry out ergonomic risk assessments using the EAWS (Ergonomic  
Assessment Worksheet) to analyze and evaluate risks caused by physical stress in the manufacturing process. The EAWS can be used 
to perform a comprehensive ergonomic assessment of work tasks that takes account of both the intensity and duration of any form of 
stress. A new project for the psychological assessment of workplaces was introduced, providing an important perspective for im-
proved workplace monitoring.
STAKEHOLDER DIALOG
As a brand, ŠKODA always aims to maintain close contact with its 
main stakeholders such as employees, communities, customers, 
governmental and other administrative bodies, suppliers, academics, 
NGOs, and professional organizations. ŠKODA identifies relevant 
needs and requirements through personal discussions, meetings, 
and participation in public forums, seminars and university lectures. 
So far, ŠKODA has always used information from the Volkswagen 
Group’s stakeholder survey and materiality matrix. In 2016, ŠKODA 
AUTO launched its own stakeholder assessment process in coopera-
tion with PriceWaterhouseCoopers. After reaching major milestones 
by the end of 2016, the process will be continued in 2017.

Lamborghini – Biopark and Biomonitoring Project
The biopark, situated in the small Italian municipality of Sant’Agata Bolognese in the city of 
 Bologna, includes a 70,000 m2 plantation of 9,000 young common oaks (quercus robur) and a fruit 
garden (30 different species on 900 m2). Since 2008, similar projects have been carried out by   
Audi at many of its production plants around the world. These plantations will be monitored over 
the coming years and decades in a project that will provide insights into forest productivity, sto-
cking (forest density) and the ability of forests to store carbon and maintain biodiversity. Special  
attractions in the forest include a nature walk featuring native tree species and a wetland area, 
where local schoolchildren can learn more about the environment. The forest even features a 
 fitness area!
In April 2016, Lamborghini established an apiary in Lamborghini Biopark. The aim is to set up a  
biomonitoring program that will track several different pollutants by analyzing honey, wax and the 
honey bees themselves. 
Bees are excellent environmental indicators, in that they can be used to indirectly monitor the  
state of health of the surrounding area. Their natural inclination to explore every corner of a  
neighborhood in search of vital resources means that every day, foragers from beehives make mil-
lions of withdrawals from various environmental matrices: pollen and nectar from flowers, honey-
dew (later transformed into honey) from leaves infested by sap-feeding insects, various resins from 
buds and twigs (used to produce propolis), and of course water sources.
Lamborghini’s apiary consists of eight hives. During 2016, samples of all the hive matrices (honey, 
pollen, wax, and the bees themselves) were taken from three of the eight hives and examined  
for local environmental pollution, including heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 
 dioxins, as well as pesticides used in agriculture and urban and private green spaces.
In 2016, the apiary produced 240 kg of honey. The honey was found to be free from all the residues 
under research.
The Lamborghini Biopark project is an opportunity for mutually profitable collaboration between 
Lamborghini and its host municipality of Sant’Agata Bolognese, because in addition to being a  
research site, the oak forest adds value to the regional landscape and environment, and also has 
an educational dimension.

Trigeneration Plant 
Trigeneration, also known as CCHp, is a system which uses a single fuel to simultaneously produce energy for heating, cooling and electricity. 
The trigeneration plant at Lamborghini, for example, uses natural gas. The thermal energy produced by the fuel is used for air conditioning  
via the refrigeration cycle of an absorption chiller, which is based on a phase-changing refrigerant combined with an absorbent. The trigener-
ation plant at Automobili Lamborghini has an installed capacity of 1.2 MWh. Electricity is supplied to the plant as a whole via a transformer, 
while the thermal energy is delivered via a new hot-water piping network. The original cogeneration plants are used to provide back-up when 
there are peaks in demand. 
The installed thermal capacity of 1,190 kWh is used to meet demand during the winter months from November to March. In summer 
(from April to october), the refrigeration output of approx. 890 kWh is absorbed by the company’s main refrigeration units. This project  
has a  number of different objectives, the most important of which is to reduce Co2 emissions. By operating the system on natural gas,  
greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by an estimated 823 t Co2. With a number of minor modifications, it will be possible to convert  
the system to run on biogas in the future.
Biogas-Powered District Heating System Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Automobili Lamborghini is the first Italian automaker to operate its own district heating system. This system pipes hot water to the plant 
from a biogas-powered cogeneration plant in Nonantola, approximately 6 kilometers away. The hot water (85°C) is pumped through under-
ground pipes to the plant, where the thermal energy is used for heating. Forecasts indicate that the biogas cogeneration plant, which  
has a total capacity of 1 MW, will in future provide Lamborghini with at least 7,200 MWh of thermal energy annually. This will reduce annual 
greenhouse emissions by an estimated 1,780 t Co2.

20 Years of Environmental Certification at Zuffenhausen
Saving energy, avoiding waste, printing on both sides of the page –  
every porsche employee knows about conserving resources and  
contributing to the company’s environmental sustainability. on 
May 20, 2016, a team of independent assessors from TÜV carried  
out their audit of porsche’s compliance with environmental standards 
in operations and production. In 1996, porsche was one of the first 
companies in the federal state of Baden Württemberg to introduce 
an EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) compliant environ-
mental management system at its Zuffenhausen facility. The company 
obtained this certification in recognition of the system’s clearly defined 
processes, lines of responsibility, and effective implementation.
Refugee Integration Program
In spring 2016, porsche AG introduced a comprehensive refugee in-
tegration program. Ten men and five women aged between 16 and 38 
were given the opportunity to qualify for vocational training or direct 
entry to a profession by attending a six-month integration program 
drawn up by porsche. The program participants came from Eritrea, Syria,  
Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. The program focuses on teaching German 
as well as basic technical skills and cultural awareness. The 13 people 
who took part in the first year of the program completed the course 
successfully, with outcomes such as going directly into employment, 
embarking on a course of vocational training or participating in further 
initiatives. A new cohort of 15 refugees joined the ongoing program in 
January 2017.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOG
Informing Local Residents about Construction Work  
in Zuffenhausen
Stakeholder groups involved: local residents and interested  
members of the public. 
Form of dialog: letters were sent to residents living in the vicinity  
of the main plant in zuffenhausen inviting them to attend an in-
formation event; this event included an explanation of the planned 
construction works, a question and answer session and a tour of the 
“Central Workshops” construction site. 
“targa” Newspaper for Residents
BStakeholder groups involved: local residents living in the vicinity of 
the zuffenhausen, Weissach and leipzig sites.
Form of dialog: site-specific information was provided to local resi-
dents and interested members of the public about new develop-
ments at Porsche such as construction projects, far-reaching company 
decisions and social outreach activities. Also, two email addresses – 
targa@porsche.de and nachgefragt@porsche.de – were set up so that 
interested readers could ask questions and provide feedback. 
Customer surveys
Stakeholder groups involved: customers
Form of dialog: the Sales and Marketing department has christened 
2015 “Customer Satisfaction year” with a view to further improving 
the quality of customer care worldwide. Under the “Customer Experi-
ence Management” initiative, Porsche has implemented hundreds 
of measures aimed at ensuring high standards of customer service 
throughout the entire customer lifecycle. As part of the initiative, cus-
tomer satisfaction surveys generate approximately 17,000 responses 
every month. This feedback directly reflects customer experience and 
feeds into the continuous improvement process. 
Identification and Analysis of Key Stakeholder Topics in 2015
The 2015 stakeholder survey on Porsche’s sustainability performance 
identified the following topics as particularly relevant (top five, in 
descending order of priority): long-term economic stability, long-term 
customer relationships, health and safety, fuel consumption/vehicle 
emissions, and staff development. These and all other survey findings 
are translated directly into a “materiality matrix”, where they are 
ranked according to their relevance to stakeholders on the one hand, 
and to the company on the other. This materiality analysis is then 
used by Porsche to set priorities for its sustainability reporting. In 
particular, it underpins the selection and editing of content in the 
Sustainability Report itself. At the same time, stakeholders’ opinions 
are also taken into account in internal decision-making, for example 
in issue prioritization and strategic planning.

The New e-Crafter – Highlight of the IAA 2016 Commercial Vehicles Show 
 § World premiere for the first all-electric Crafter
 § Concept shows solution for zero-emission urban delivery vehicle  
nearly ready for series production
 § No limits on load space
 § Carries up to 1.7 tons
 § Range of over 200 km
 § First vehicles hit the roads in 2017
Electric power has not altered the character of the new Crafter. The concept vehicle still offers 
attractive yet robust internal features, including the largest possible payload capacity, an ideal 
11.3 m3 load space and a maximum load height of 1,961 millimeters. A generous 1,380 mm pay-
load width between the wheel arches and a maximum load space length of 4,855 mm round  
off the vehicle – with no change to package dimensions.
The 100 kW electric drive accelerates the road-ready concept (with a dependable gross weight of 
4.25 t) up to the maximum permitted speed of 80 km/h. The vehicle is equally at home on delivery 
routes along urban highways as it is driving across country. With maximum torque of 290 Nm, 
available almost instantaneously, real-world driving situations can easily be handled even when 
carrying a full load weighing 1,709 kg.
Highly Efficient Environmental Solutions at New Crafter Plant in Września
The new Crafter plant in Września, approximately 50 km from poznań, was officially opened in 
october 2016. The design and construction of the new plant met the most demanding environ-
mental standards right from the start, in line with the “Think Blue. Factory.” strategy. From an envi-
ronmental protection perspective, one of the highlights here is the paintshop, which is exception-
ally resource-efficient and consumes remarkably little energy, water or materials. paint is applied 
automatically, by 36 robots. Efficient, high-speed rotating atomizers and color changers use much 
less paint than conventional systems. In the paint booths, process air is scrubbed using a dry sepa-
ration system, reducing energy consumption in the booth by up to 60%. No water or chemicals are 
required, and process air volumes are reduced as well. A new system for energy-optimized spray 
booth air conditioning is also in operation. 
The body dryers are equipped with energy-saving heat recovery technology. The body shop uses the 
latest, most energy-efficient robots and state-of-the-art laser technology that is substantially more 
efficient. The factory buildings and infrastructure were also built in accordance with Volkswagen’s 
strict environmental criteria. Ventilation technology and energy media supply meet high standards 
of efficiency, while the lighting system makes use of natural daylight and LED technology. Water 
savings were also made in assembly, where the sprinkler booths used to check that vehicles are 
watertight achieve savings of up to 75% compared to traditional processes. In December 2016, the 
plant was awarded the Golden Certificate of the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB). The 
plant in Września is the only automotive production center in the world to be honored with this 
distinction, as well as the first and the only building in poland.
The e-Crafter concept incorporates 
the latest developments in battery 
technology that allow a freely config-
urable range up to 400 km, depending 
on customer needs and the demands 
of the job. This performance makes 
the vehicle an intriguing prospect for 
many sectors, over and above urban 
transport.

OTHER SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS
Golden Bulli 2016
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles launched its new “Golden Camper” prize in 2016, recognizing craft workshops that are committed to 
social responsibility. The prize is open to all workshops licensed under the German Crafts and Trade Code. A specialist panel comprising 
experts from the industry press, associations and businesses selects the winner. The first prize was presented to roland Ketterer GmbH, 
from Donaueschingen-pfohren in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. Chair of the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Brand Board of 
Management Dr. Eckhard Stolz handed over the prize at a ceremony held on December 13, 2016. roland Ketterer, owner of the plumb-
ing firm that bears his name, and his employees came up with the idea and raised funds for the construction of a specialist school for 
drinking water and solar energy expertise in the Tanzanian town of Chala, home to some 10,000 people. In recognition of its outstanding 
efforts, the company, which employs 12 people, was rewarded with a versatile, new Transporter panel van.
Steadily Reducing CO2 Emissions:  
Caddy and T6 Reflect Progress
Volkswagen has set itself the target of reducing fuel consumption for each new model by 10–15% compared with its predecessor. 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has taken up the challenge and set new benchmarks with the introduction of new engines for the 
commercial variants of the Caddy 4 and T6 models. In the Caddy, we have succeeded in reducing emissions by up to 30g Co2/km – up to 
20% less than the previous version. 
The engine range includes a 3-cylinder TSI unit and a natural-gas engine in the Caddy TGI. Meanwhile, fuel efficiency in the T6 range has 
been improved by 20% on average. BlueMotion Technology, including a start-stop system and brake energy regeneration, is standard on 
these models.

“Think Blue. Factory”: Volkswagen Environmental Program  
Meets 2018 Targets Ahead of Schedule
In the reporting period, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles once again achieved a significant cut in energy consumption at its Hanover 
site. Compared with the 2010 baseline, when the “Think Blue. Factory.” program was launched, the site consumed around 15% less 
energy in 2016 despite producing a record 189,600 vehicles. The energy savings equate to the annual average energy usage of around 
10,000 households. 
Compared with the 2010 baseline, the company now uses 17% less water and has slashed waste for disposal (non-recyclable waste) 
by an amazing 75%. Co2 and solvent emissions have fallen by 11% and 13% respectively. At the same time, production volumes have 
risen significantly in all areas of activity, with 45% more vehicles, 6.4% more cooling systems and 52% more castings.
The savings for each of the five key indicators are even more impressive after adding the number of vehicles produced into the 
equation; efficiency improvements range from 31% (water) to 85% (waste). Thus the Hanover site has already exceeded Volkswagen’s 
stated aim of improving these figures by 25% by 2018.
ralf ohliger, the Environment officer in Hanover, reported that “the successes of the ‘Think Blue. Factory.’ environmental program 
have come about as a result of technical solutions and the many innovative ideas and measures suggested by our workforce. Green 
production has become a major competitive advantage for us. And our Hanover plant is definitely benefiting from the progress we 
have made.”
The monetary value of the reduced costs associated with these environmental improvements amount to some €6.5 million over  
the year.
The key measures that contributed to the success of “Think Blue. Factory” included:
 § New, efficient servo press lines (“pXL”)
 § upgrades to the latest, energy-efficient laser technology in the body shop
 § Smart finish-drying control system (LAVA load-dependent volume flow adjustment)
 § Installation of innovative color changers and highly efficient application technology in the paintshop
 § optimization of the rinsing processes and introduction of  
a VoC-free rinsing thinner in the paintshop
 § Implementation of a new ventilation concept combined with a modernized power supply for the  
ventilation system in vehicle assembly 
 § Commissioning of new low-energy, resource-efficient  
smelting lines in the alloy foundry
 § Changeover to a waste water-free process in the radiator manufacturing plant
 § Systematic out-of-hours shutdown of production equipment and infrastructure
Since the “Think Blue. Factory.” initiative was introduced in 2010, all Volkswagen and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand produc-
tion sites have been working to achieve major improvements in plant resource efficiency while simultaneously reducing emissions. 
The five key indicators that “Think Blue. Factory.” is seeking to improve by 25% per production unit by 2018 include energy and water 
consumption, waste disposal, and solvent and Co2 emissions.
SPRINT” Language and Integration Project
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has joined forces with the Hanover-based Volkswagen Akademie vocational training organization

Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles models won 32 international 
first-place awards in reader and expert rankings published by  
renowned industry journals and committees in 2016. The Caddy,  
T6 and other vehicles also won awards for their sustainability 
credentials. For example:
The Caddy from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles won the “Green 
Van” prize in 2016. Once again, VerkehrsRundschau and Trucker 
magazines presented this award for the most environmentally 
friendly commercial vehicle in 2016. The Caddy Maxi was nominat-
ed in a category comprising five other vans. It emerged as the victor 
in the competition thanks to its low fuel consumption, compliance 
with Euro 6 exhaust emission standards across the range, and 
ability to transport up to 669 kg in a 4.2 m3 load space. The tests 
run by VerkehrsRundschau and Trucker magazines were based on a 
standardized test route involving a mix of city streets, motorways 
and minor highways. All of the vans in the test were driven by the 
ency. Company representatives make a point of listening to critical 
questions from local residents, for example about emissions or the 
local traffic situation. This neighborhood dialog has been in place 
at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles since 1998. The open dialog 
format has helped to break down skepticism and fostered a climate 
of mutual understanding. The ongoing discourse with the factory’s 
neighbors has become an integral part of Volkswagen Commercial 
Vehicles’ corporate and environmental policy.
Dialog and Community Involvement
Volkswagen’s Polish plants in Poznań and Września also maintain 
regular dialog with their neighbors. At least two meetings with 
local residents are held each year by all four plants. The meetings 
are organized with local leaders such as village elders or commu-
nity councils. Agenda items include the current situation at the 
factories, as well as social responsibility. One of the social projects 
in 2016 was the creation of a football pitch in a joint initiative with 
the neighbors of the Crafter plant in Września. 
same test driver on the same roads, carrying the same 500 kg load. 
According to the magazines’ results, the Caddy used 5.8 liters of 
fuel per 100 km. In addition to the fuel consumption under test 
conditions, the ratings also took account of the load space dimen-
sions and actual payload weight (based on the calculated weight  
of the empty test vehicle with a full tank of fuel and driver). Addi-
tional points were awarded for fuel-saving technology and the  
Euro 6-compliant diesel engine.
The new generation of diesel units used in the Caddy meets the 
latest Euro 6 requirements, as well as the new limits applicable 
to commercial vehicles from September 2016. TGI versions of 
both the Caddy and Caddy Maxi are also available. These 1.4-liter 
engines are tuned to use less fuel and run on cost-efficient CNG. 
All Caddy engines are fitted with a start-stop system, brake energy 
regeneration, and tires with optimized rolling resistance.
“SprINT”, the language and integration project, teaches the  following content over a 12-month period:
 § Module I: German language skills (15 hours per week, at vocational school)
 § Module II: Introduction to regional culture and traditions (10 hours per week, at vocational school)
 § Module III: Introduction to the local world of work (10 hours per week, at Volkswagen Akademie in Hanover)

The New Premium
In August 2016, Scania marked its 125th anniversary with the launch of a new generation of 
trucks, the biggest investment in the company’s history. Created to set a new premium standard  
in the transport industry, the new products and services also represent a major landmark on the 
journey toward the future of sustainable transport. The new truck delivers 5% fuel savings on  
average due to an improved powertrain and better aerodynamics. As part of the focus on safety, 
the new vehicle also includes the world’s first rollover side curtain airbag for trucks. Scania’s unique 
solution has the potential to significantly reduce the severity of injuries from rollover accidents.
BRT Accra Ghana
Scania aims to drive sustainable mobility in rapidly growing cities by offering clever, cost-efficient 
bus and coach systems and associated services. In Ghana’s capital city of Accra, Scania is rolling  
out the most comprehensive and complete Bus rapid Transit (BrT) system in the company’s history. 
With 245 connected buses operating in their own dedicated lanes, the system is improving the 
quality of life in one of Africa’s largest cities.
World’s First Electric Road
In June 2016, the world’s first electric road was inaugurated near the Swedish city of Gävle.  
Scania’s electrically powered truck was the first to drive the route in open highway traffic, using 
conductive technology developed by Siemens. The truck on the road is a Euro 6-certified hybrid 
that operates as an electric vehicle when on the electrified road lane and as a regular hybrid  
running on biofuel at other times, for example when overtaking. A second truck will go into opera-
tion in June 2017.
OTHER PROJECTS
Transport Academy to Support Ghana’s BRT System
To ensure that the new BrT system in Accra continues to operate successfully, skilled technicians are needed more than ever. To provide in- 
demand knowledge of heavy-duty vehicles, Scania offers students vocational training at its modern workshop facility. In collaboration with 
the Government Technical Training Centre (GTTC), a vocational school, Scania provides specialized training for 30 students per year.
ETHA – Fossil Fuel Alternatives
During 2016, Scania launched the ETHA initiative in cooperation with Lantmännen, a Swedish agricultural cooperative. The purpose of ETHA 
is to make it easy for companies to choose a sustainable solution without compromising on their needs. ETHA is a full-scale solution for 
customers, with Scania providing the vehicle technology and Lantmännen providing locally produced bioethanol as well as the necessary

Skill Capture
Skill Capture is Scania’s framework for developing diversity and inclusion practices and implementing them in our everyday business. The 
purpose of Skill Capture is reflected in the name: to help Scania capture the diversity of skills, expertise and viewpoints of our most valuable 
assets – our employees. 
The process starts with Skill Capture Initial Labs, which focus on establishing ways of working that will allow all our present and future employ-
ees to perform at their full potential in a diverse, inclusive corporate culture. This results in concrete actions taken by our management teams.  
To spread best practices and bring together the most urgently needed improvements, Scania will track how corporate attitudes change 
throughout the process. Starting in 2016, Initial Labs have been conducted with Scania’s top management teams, including the Executive 
Board. To measure the progress of employees’ perception of Scania as a diverse and inclusive company, questions on this issue were included  
in the 2016 Employee Satisfaction Barometer survey.
New Ways of Working
Aiming to find new ways of working and new ideas for dealing with challenging issues surrounding sustainability, the procurement depart-
ment launched the Wild and Crazy project. The Wild and Crazy project is about giving interested purchasers from different departments  
the opportunity to work together on developing new solutions for challenges facing the procurement division. The project team members 
split up into groups to tackle specific issues. After working on each issue for two to three months, they present the results to representatives  
of Scania’s senior management.
Scania’s Own Transport
Scania wants to be the benchmark in sustainable logistics. In parallel with actively improving our own transportation network to increase 
efficiency in logistical flows and minimize Co2 emissions, we also ensure that social and legal issues are taken into account. To adopt these  
best practices, decisions within our logistical operations are based on achieving the best balance between three imperatives: Co2 emissions, 
quality and cost. When sourcing transport solutions, Scania assigns the same value to Co2 reduction as to cost-cutting measures or quality 
improvements. In two important tenders, this approach immediately resulted in emission reductions of 19% and 22% respectively, without 
compromising quality or increasing costs.
STAKEHOLDER DIALOG 
Sustainable Transport Forum
On August 23, 2016, Scania held a Sustainable Transport Forum 
in Paris, bringing together some of the world’s most prominent 
decision- makers and influencers in the sustainability sphere.  
“Driving the Shift” focused on how the transport industry can play  
a crucial transformative role in moving the world toward a sustain-
able future. There was unanimous agreement in the Forum on  
the overwhelming and urgent need to make lasting changes for 
the good of all.
Swedish Leadership on Sustainable Development (SLSD)
Scania is an active member of SlSD, a multi-stakeholder network 
for sustainable development. The members of this network share 
knowledge and carry out joint projects to promote sustainable  
development and reduce poverty. In addition to climate and environ-
mental issues, focal topics in 2016 included promoting the decent 
work agenda and tackling corruption.
ABC City
By steadily increasing the demand for transport solutions that are  
efficient, high-capacity and low-carbon, cities are a key driver of

We provide efficient transportation 
and energy solutions
The MAN Group is one of the leading commercial vehicle, engine  
and mechanical engineering companies in Europe. As a supplier  
of trucks, buses, transporters, diesel engines, turbomachinery  
and special-purpose transmissions, MAN is a market leader in all 
areas of business activity. In 2016, its 53,824-strong workforce  
generated sales revenues of €13.6 billion and an operating profit 
of €204 million.
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR
Munich Cogeneration Plant and Climate Pact with City Business Community 
2016 saw the completion of the project to build a cogeneration plant (CHp) at the Munich site. 
When the 2.5 MW natural gas CHp went on line in December, it started to contribute toward mee-
ting the site’s electricity and heating requirements, marking a major milestone in MAN’s climate 
strategy and “Green production” initiative. up to 20% of the site’s electricity requirement can now 
be generated by this local facility. 
In addition, by using the heat that is produced during the electricity generation process, the CHp 
helps to make significant energy and carbon savings. This measure alone will contribute some 40% 
of the carbon emission reduction target for the Munich site.
As part of the Munich business community climate pact launched by the City of Munich, MAN is  
in touch with 14 other large local firms that share the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
The agreement was signed by all partners at the City Hall in 2016, when an initial workshop was 
held. The result of the workshop was a joint measure involving apprentices from all participating 
companies, who trained as “energy scouts” in sessions provided by the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. MAN’s principal contribution to the climate pact is the construction of the Munich CHp, 
as well as other climate-friendly construction projects on site.

Energy-efficient LED Lighting 
All parts of the MAN SE group of companies ramped up their efforts to switch over to energy- 
efficient lighting in 2016. Following successful testing of installations completed in previous years, 
MAN has now completed indoor and outdoor LED lighting installations at over 20 of the sites ope-
rated by MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Diesel & Turbo, MAN Latin America and renk. Not only do these 
projects tap into LEDs’ great potential for improving energy efficiency, they have also optimized the 
way lighting is used. Modern lighting control systems are helping to deploy efficient lighting in a 
targeted manner.
Refugee Relief 
Auch 2016 arbeitete MAN eng mit dem SoS-Kinderdorf zusammen. Schwerpunkt bildeten in  
In 2016, MAN once again worked closely with SoS Children’s Villages. With total donations of 
€150,000, MAN is currently supporting a range of educational projects that prepare children and 
young people for independent living. This year’s focus was on refugee relief initiatives. 
An example of the projects that were funded is the social lunch club at the SoS Children’s Village 
in Salzgitter. This club provides children from deprived families with a hot meal before helping 
them with their homework.
MAN also supports projects at the SoS Children’s Villages in Ammersee and Augsburg, where un-
accompanied child refugees are looked after in several residential homes. In addition to activities de-
signed to teach important life skills, these children receive German language tuition to help them 
integrate successfully into their new home. 
MAN’s commitment to SoS Children’s Village is not simply financial; employees are also encouraged 
to do charitable work. For example, MAN trainees organized a basketball match and a MAN factory 
tour for young refugees. In addition, four MAN employees in Munich work as mentors, helping 
young people with their schoolwork and in their search for jobs. 
In fiscal year 2016, 39 refugees joined the MAN Group via introductory courses, apprenticeships, in-
ternships or various forms of employment.
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF MAN CLIMATE STRATEGY
MAN continued to pursue its climate objectives in 2016, as the 
company seeks to reduce carbon emissions by 25% by 2020. 
Co2 emissions from the company’s plants have been reduced by 
19.8% compared with the 2008 baseline. 
At first glance, this marks further progress. Even at second 
glance, it confirms the success of the measures that have been 
adopted. Despite a 5% increase in sales at MAN Truck & Bus, 
the direct correlation between production volume and Co2 
emissions is steadily declining. A number of projects were com-
pleted in 2016, the effects of which had not yet become fully 
evident in the year under review; thus their full impact will only 
become clear in the 2017 report. 
These include:
 § The Munich CHp, where two 2.5 MW generators are helping  
to reduce annual Co2 emissions by approximately 9,500 t
 § Further expansion of the central well water supply for energy- 
efficient cooling
 § Comprehensive renovation of lighting systems at over  
20 different production locations
 § replacement of distributed heating systems by a central CHp 
at the rheine plant
 § replacement of pump systems and drives by more efficient 
installations at several sites

In addition to cutting Co2 emissions from its sites, MAN has 
also made major leaps forward in reducing the carbon foot-
print of its products. More than 90% of carbon emissions are 
produced during the use phase of a product’s life cycle. For this 
reason, research and development activities are now focusing 
on making commercial vehicles, engines and turbomachinery 
more efficient, more economical and greener.
However, driving style can also have a significant impact on the 
fuel consumption of buses and trucks. This has been borne out by 
the Connected Co-Driver Training program run by MAN profiDrive, 
in which a trainer, acting as a virtual passenger, gives advice to the 
driver over a set period. Several hundred test drives have shown 
that this training approach can result in annual savings of up to 
3,500 liters of diesel fuel over a total distance of 150,000 km of 
long-haul operation.
STAKEHOLDER DIALOG
Customer Participation and Dialog
Engaging in dialog with our customers is a core initiative of our 
climate strategy, offering valuable opportunities to share ideas 
about reducing global carbon emissions. After all, many of them 
have also set targets to for limiting CO2. Understanding the future 
needs of our customers is essential for us at MAN. By incorporating 
customers’ requirements into the development of our products 
and services, we can improve the value added. Since 2009, focus 
groups comprising selected truck and bus customers have been 
giving us their feedback and holding discussions with MAN experts 
and MAN Truck & Bus sales executives. We also seek to enter into 
dialog with customers at trade fairs in order to discuss specific 
topics. For example, at Power-Gen Europe 2016, MAN Diesel & 
Turbo introduced a modular power plant concept, while our entire 
maritime portfolio was present at the leading maritime trade fair 
SMM 2016. 
Customer Satisfaction
Alongside our employees, our customers are our most important 
stakeholders, because they have a significant impact on our business 
success. To foster long-term relationships with customers so that 
we can better understand their needs, we carry out regular surveys 
across all areas of our business. These help to establish whether 
customers are satisfied with our products and services. For example, 
MAN Truck & Bus is constantly gaging customer satisfaction through 
its ongoing Customer-First Study (CFS). In 2016, around 40,000 cus-
tomers were interviewed by phone as part of the CFS study – consid-
erably more than in the previous year. Over 90% of the respondents 
rated MAN Truck & Bus as “good” or better, and 70% as “very good”. 
Thus, customer satisfaction has improved compared with 2015. 
Every two years, MAN Diesel & Turbo sends out a comprehensive 
customer survey as part of the company’s Customer Satisfaction 
Monitoring program. In 2015, some 4,000 customers were asked 
about the company’s products and services. 35% of the respondents 
rated MAN Diesel & Turbo’s performance as “good”, 42% as “very 
good” and 9% as “excellent”. MAN Diesel & Turbo’s next global cus-
tomer satisfaction survey will be conducted in 2017.
We will use the results of these surveys to test the effectiveness of 
the measures introduced to improve customer satisfaction and to 
determine what further actions to take.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2016
My Finance Coach 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG provided funding for the My Finance Coach social enterprise 
 through to the summer of 2016. This initiative aimed to encourage children and young people to 
take a closer interest in economic affairs, and to teach them life skills for dealing with money. Some 
280 of Volkswagen Financial Services AG’s employees volunteered and were trained as Finance 
Coaches. They were deployed in pairs to secondary schools, where they worked with teaching staff 
to explain complicated monetary and financial concepts to the students. using a range of school-
friendly classroom materials, the volunteers showed the young people how to manage their own 
personal finances responsibly. 
In addition, Volkswagen Financial Services AG was involved as a jury member in a nationwide com-
petition for youngsters learning about financial affairs. The competition is a core component of  
the My Finance Coach course materials, and pupils attending a wide variety of schools across the 
country take part in the competition throughout the academic year.
For more than ten years, Volkswagen Financial Services AG has been supporting free mobility for 
children, young people and the elderly with its “Bus project”. This project, organized in cooperation 
with the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, enables participants to experience modern works of art exhi-
bited at the art museum over a 16-week period each year. More than 60,000 school students and 
some 7,500 senior citizens have visited these exhibitions since the project first started in 2002.

Social and Regional Responsibility 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG founded its charitable foundation for disadvantaged children 
in Braunschweig in December 2008. “Stiftung – unsere Kinder in Braunschweig” provides nine 
establishments – including daycare centers, primary schools and high schools – with customized 
educational support, including healthy eating, physical education and early musical training.  
Several other institutions such as sports and youth clubs are also supported on an ad-hoc basis. 
In 2016, the foundation continued to fund the “Gewaltfrei Lernen” (non-violent learning), “Klasse  
2000” (class of 2000) and “Vorbereiten auf das Berufsleben” (preparing for working life) projects. 
Two new schemes for 2016 included a project that uses theater as a tool for teaching language 
skills, and another that gives primary schoolchildren the opportunity to experience a day out in 
nature.
Volkswagen Financial Services AG also carries out regular fundraising campaigns for charities. Its 
employee donation program, “Belegschaftsspende Mai”, supported a regional charity. Money 
from the “restcentspende” (spare cents) initiative was donated to the terre des hommes “one 
hour for the future” campaign. For the third year running, the workforce held a very successful 
collection to donate articles to the “Fairkauf” charity department store.
Among the company’s various voluntary activities, the Works Council’s Christmas Tree Wishlist  
initiative, carried out in cooperation with a range of charities, has become a firm favorite. In 2016, 
employees answered the Christmas wishes of 547 socially disadvantaged children.
As in the previous year, we continued to make donations to refugee charities. A dedicated website 
at www.fsag-hilft.de acts as a permanent portal for employees seeking volunteer opportunities. 
The money raised by employee donations in 2015, which was doubled to €68,490 by the company, 
is being used to fund refugee aid projects managed by refugium, a refugee relief organization  
in Braunschweig.
Partnership between Volkswagen Financial Services  
and German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) 
The aim of the joint venture between Volkswagen Financial Services and German Nature and  
Biodiversity Conservation union is to help NABu with wetland conservation projects. 
over the past few years, the two partners have received numerous awards for their commitment. 
For example, in addition to the project being named an official project of the uN Decade on Bio-
diversity in 2014 and 2016, they also received the EcoGlobe in 2010, as well as an award in Germany’s 
 “Ausgewählter ort im Land der Ideen” contest in 2012. This provides further evidence that under 
Volkswagen’s environmental program, ecological and economic benefits go hand in hand. Volkswagen  
Financial Services and NABu have extended their joint involvement in wetland conservation at in-
ternational level, too. NABu and Volkswagen Financial Services launched the International peat-
land Conservation Fund to provide finance for international nature conservation and climate  
protection activities in, for example, the Slowinski National park in poland. By 2019, we plan to 
con tri bute €1 million in funding to this initiative. The fund complements the German peatland Con-
servation Fund, founded in 2012, to which we have already contributed €2 million.

Argentina
While Argentina’s economic problems continued in 2016, and the 
automotive industry was obliged to adjust production headcounts 
in response to declining demand from Brazil, VW Argentina was able 
to continue with all CSR projects currently in progress. Despite the 
above-mentioned production problems, VW Argentina maintained 
its market leadership in Argentina for the 13th year running.
Employee volunteers played an important role in helping children 
in kindergartens and social institutions. Nearly every weekend, 
volunteers organized trips in the Amarok pickups provided by VW, 
bringing donations of clothes, shoes and educational materials to 
schools and kindergartens in the interior of the country. As Christmas 
approached, we organized the “A smile for Christmas” campaign, 
during which employees donated toys and traditional Argentinian 
Christmas pastries and sweets to children at five kindergartens and 
nursery schools. The company also made financial donations for 
improving the infrastructure in the five schools.
VW also continued to organize the eye exam program for elemen-
tary schools in the Tigre region. Since this program was launched 
in 2008, more than 10,000 children with impaired vision have been 
given support.
In a joint project with VW, the Ferdinand Porsche Institute and the 
National Technological University have continued to run a teaching 
program for engineers specializing in the automotive industry. Over 
the last year, 400 students have taken part in the program – in fact, 
it was the most popular course at the university. This year will see 
the graduation of the first student intake, helping to improve the 
competitiveness of Argentina’s automotive industry.
ELECTRIC MOBILITY
VW Argentina has also subscribed to the global “TOGETHER – 
 Strategy 2025” and has started to focus on electric mobility.
Commercializing and developing all-electric vehicles in Argentina 
will require close cooperation between the industry and government 
agencies, in order to generate favorable legal conditions and an in-
frastructure capable of supporting the new vehicles’ unconventional 
characteristics. This work has already started, and although there is 
still a way to go, we firmly believe that e-mobility is the future and 
are determined to bring it to fruition.
With this in mind, we have already started to show off electrically 
powered vehicles to our customers in the form of the GTE Golf at the 
e-Golf exhibition on our Summer Stand in Cariló, Buenos Aires.

In 2016, Volkswagen launched its regionalization Strategy and created a new structure in South America that also incorporates Central 
America and the Caribbean. The president and CEo of Volkswagen do Brasil, David powels, is now responsible for all the Volkswagen 
brand’s operations and activities in the new SAM region (South America, Central America and the Caribbean), supported by an Execu-
tive Committee. The SAM region is composed of 29 countries, has a population of 500 million people and boasts annual vehicle sales 
of 4.4 million units. In this region, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and peru represent 85% of the brand’s sales. With this regionaliza-
tion strategy, Volkswagen aims to connect more closely with consumers, becoming even more agile and competitive in all regions of 
the world. The aim is to enchant customers by offering products and services that are updated and adapted in response to local needs. 
Through lean structures and more agile decision-making, the brand intends to strengthen internal entrepreneurship and profitability 
in order to foster sustainable growth. Volkswagen do Brasil will continue to work in cooperation with Volkswagen head office, but will 
have more autonomy to make decisions, plus greater responsibility for targets and results.
STAKEHOLDER DIALOG
Every three years, Volkswagen do Brasil reviews its materiality 
matrix in order to update the key topics of interest to stakeholders 
covered in the document. By late 2014 and early 2015, the company 
had expanded the stakeholder survey process last performed as 
part of the document’s development process in 2012, by contacting 
representatives of the following priority stakeholders: individual and 
corporate customers, communities surrounding all four production 
plants, dealerships, companies in the automotive sector, employees 
at all four units, Class Entities, vendors, public-sector agencies, finan-
cial institutions, company executives, German head offices, NGOs, 
and trade unions/associations. This process involved more than 
400 interviews and discussion meetings. 
A total of 38 topics were mapped, 15 of which were prioritized as 
the topics of greatest relevance for both the company and its stake-
holders. These topics include:
1. Eco-efficient products
2. Efficient production: use of resources and materials
3. Sustainable supply chain
4. Economic performance in Brazil
5. Risk management, compliance and conformity 
6. Business ethics 
7. Vehicle safety 
8. Employment
9. Emissions
10. Mobility 
11. Social investments 
12. Vision and strategy 
13. Disposal of materials, parts and vehicle maintenance
14. Customer satisfaction 
15. Occupational health and safety
Upon due analysis of the materiality matrix results in a meeting of 
the company’s Executive Committee, executives decided not to cover 
the Mobility topic in this year’s edition due to its strategic business 
nature. The Executive Committee members did, however, decide to 
cover the three following topics in this edition. These topics were 
mapped in the materiality matrix, but ranked below the cut-off line, 
set at 50% for both company and stakeholders. The executives chose 
to cover these topics in this document due to their high relevance for 
the business:

Volkswagen Group China Environmental Education Fund Established to Support China’s  
Environmental Education Activities Nationwide
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel joined Chinese premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on June 14, 
2016, to witness the signing of an agreement between Volkswagen Group China and the Chinese 
Ministry of Environmental protection’s China Environmental protection Foundation. The agree-
ment creates a new fund supporting environmental education training for teachers across the 
country. 
The “1,000 Environment-Friendly Youth Ambassadors Action program” was initiated, is managed 
and executed by the Ministry of Environmental protection’s Center for Environmental Education 
and Communication (CEEC). Volkswagen is the sole sponsor of the ¥10 million phased program, 
which will run for at least three years, initially from 2016 to 2019. Stated goals include: training 
1,000 teachers nationwide each year on environmental issues and environmental education methods,  
thereby enabling them to develop and tailor suitable curricula. The program will also deliver envi-
ronmental education and eco-planning skills to thousands of students, empowering them to make 
an impact in their schools and communities.
Volkswagen will open its Chinese manufacturing facilities for teacher visits, sharing best practices 
and key lessons in environmental protection.

SAIC VoLKSWAGEN’s CHp project represents the efficient use of natural energy, 
maximizing the utilization of energy resources and significantly reducing emissions 
of Co2, greenhouse gases and TSp. The implementation of this project will reduce 
energy consumption by the equivalent of 11,594 t of standard coal each year, and 
reduce annual Co2 emissions by 59,308 t. It is making an important contribution to 
the protection of air quality.
Second Stage Sewage Treatment Facility at FAW-Volkswagen Car Plant in Foshan
The second stage of the sewage treatment station at the FAW-Volkswagen car plant 
in Foshan is used to treat industrial and sanitary sewage with a treatment capacity 
of 2,200 m3/d. Thanks to an aerobic MBr process, effluent water quality can match 
the GB/T18920-2002 “reuse of recycled urban water – water quality standards for 
urban miscellaneous water consumption”. The recycled water is reused for irrigation 
and toilet flushing. Some 200,000 t of water is recycled annually. The plant has an 
advanced treatment capacity of 300,000 – 400,000 t of recycled water for delivery to 
the cooling water circulation system.
The sewage station is mainly equipped with high-efficiency motors and water 
pumps (all with frequency control); the degree of automation at the sewage station 
is well above 90%. The latest flat-membrane process has been implemented for the 
first time at any FAW-Volkswagen plant, capable of dealing with more than double 
the usual sludge load. The membrane is also easy to maintain and does not retain 
pollution. Biological deodorization technology has been used to maintain good air 
 quality around the sewage station area.
Recycling Industrial Steam Condensation instead of Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water  
for Washing Machines at Volkswagen Automatic Transmission (Dalian) Co., Ltd.
At VWATD, water from industrial steam condensate was plumbed through to 
washing machines by adding pipes connecting the industrial steam system to the 
ro water tank. The main impact of the improvement is a considerable saving in 
freshwater, as well as a reduction in the working frequency of the ro water pumps 
and discharges of domestic sewage. 
In 2016, the improved process saved 4,800 t of ro water by generating 400 t of 
condensation water per month. Since the ro water system’s production efficiency 
is around 60%, this represents a saving of around 8,000 t of fresh water. In financial 
terms, this is equivalent to an annual saving of ¥35,200.

Fighting Water Shortages
Volkswagen India has built a series of embankments (bunds) for water storage in a 
drought-affected village in the State of Maharashtra. This CSr project was undertaken 
under the aegis of a State Government initiative (Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan) that aims to 
declare around 5,000 villages in the state drought-free every year till 2019.  
These water bunds will have sufficient capacity to store more than 7,500  cubic meters 
of water and will be especially beneficial for irrigating farmlands.
This is the second water conservation project undertaken by Volkswagen India after  
the recharging of water resources in the village of Guilani in 2013. 
Key Environmental Goal Achieved – Three Years ahead of Schedule
The Volkswagen plant in pune is one of 27 Volkswagen car production plants worldwide participat-
ing in the “Think Blue. Factory.” environmental program. With this initiative, Volkswagen is seeking 
to reduce the impact of its vehicle production on the environment by 25% per vehicle around the 
world. The program was rolled out in 2011 and the pune plant has been working to achieve this 
goal since 2012. During the reporting period, the plant celebrated an important achievement: by 
the turn of the year 2014/2015, waste generation had been reduced by 30.5%. This meant that 
the pune plant had met an important target three years ahead of schedule. However, successes 
were also achieved in other key areas: Co2 emissions fell by 21.2% and specific energy consumption 
decreased by 20.6%.
OTHER PROJECTS
Promoting Women in Pune
In the reporting period, Volkswagen Group India launched an initiative to promote women at the pune plant. The aim of this program is to 
increase the number of women in the workforce to 30% by 2025. Currently, only around 12% of employees are female. The starting shot was 
fired at a kick-off meeting in March, attended by more than 120 female employees, who were given the details of the skills development ini-
tiative aimed specifically at women. In practice, there are three cornerstones to the initiative: the Sakhi (friend) Group, the Compass program 
and the Mentor program. The Sakhi Group seeks to encourage communication between women on a range of different topics, for example 
the impact of women on the world economy, best practices, Volkswagen’s business, networks and personal careers. under the Compass 
program, a select group of women, all of whom have already made progress and established themselves in their respective fields, meets on a 
regular basis. They are given several months of training to enable them to further develop their high potential. The Mentor program supports 
women who have already progressed to another level. The focus here is on mentoring, training, strategy and best practice.
Dual Education Mechatronics Apprenticeship Program
In 2011, Volkswagen India Academy introduced a 3.5-year dual education Mechatronics Apprenticeship program. Based on the German dual 
vocational education and training system (VET), the program imparts theoretical and practical knowledge across fields such as mechanical, 
electrical and electronic engineering, as well as IT. This is complemented by training in interpersonal skills. Each year the program recruits 
16 students who have graduated from class X and meet other eligibility criteria. A unique feature of this program is its focus on recruiting ac-
ademically bright and financially deserving students from local towns and villages. The students are provided with stipends for the duration 
of the program. VW also endeavors to ensure that each new intake comprises at least 25% female students.
The students take the tests administered by the National Council for Vocational Training India and Deutscher Industrie-und Handelkam-
mertag (IGCC). The curriculum is made more challenging by giving the students opportunities to participate in both national and internation-
al skills-based competitions. Two cohorts of students have successfully completed the program and are now employed at VW. The fifth cohort 
was enrolled in 2015.

Support for Charitable Institutions
Volkswagen Group rus supports a number of institutions and organizations committed to social welfare. one example is the children’s hos-
pice in St. petersburg. Since 2010, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has been supporting the children’s hospice in St. petersburg, which is also 
the first children’s hospice in russia. During the reporting period, the company provided two VW Multivans to the hospice for medical and 
other trips. Around 300 families made use of the assistance provided by doctors, nurses and psychologists both at home and directly at the 
hospice, with further support for improving the quality of life of both patients and their families.
ŠKoDA Auto russia has been part of Volkswagen Group rus since 2011, and has provided continuous support to well-known international 
charity SoS Children’s Villages. Currently, the charity uses 11 ŠKoDA octavia and Yeti cars in various locations to provide much-needed mobili-
ty across this enormous country’s vast territories. In 2016, the company invited children under the charity’s supervision to the Ice Hockey 
World Championship 2016 in Moscow. It was an unforgettable experience, and for some children the first time they had ever visited the capital. 
At Christmas time, Volkswagen Group rus employees from Moscow, Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod traditionally pay visits and organize dona-
tions of gifts or money to orphanages and charities in the vicinity. In 2016, visits were made to six children’s institutions and charities. In June, 
employees of the VGr factory in Kaluga spent a day at Kondrovo orphanage organizing sports programs and master classes and talking about 
environmental issues with the children. Also in 2016, a group of volunteers from the company’s Moscow office initiated a project with an 
orphanage in Kolomna, 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital. Every month throughout the year, they visited 27 children, bringing 
food and other goods, as well as books and presents. They discussed a wide variety of topics and organized educational games and activi-
ties for the kids.
Sport for a Good Cause / Young Football and Hockey Professionals 
The company has provided regular support for sports activities in russia, and in 2016, became involved in the development of youth  
sports at the national level. Volkswagen and ŠKoDA both continued to organize the Volkswagen Junior Masters Cup and ŠKoDA Junior  
Ice Hockey Cup in russia, supporting and developing talented young players from all over the country and popularizing sports and a healthy 
lifestyle. 
The Volkswagen Junior Masters Cup has been held in russia since 2006. The winning team at the national level represents the country bian-
nually in the international finals. In 2015/2016, five teams from Moscow and the Moscow region – a total of 65 young football players aged 
11–13 – competed to represent russia at the VW Junior Masters World Cup in France in May 2016. The project is ongoing and will continue  
to run across russia in the future, with the aim of raising further interest in sport generally and football in particular among young players  
and potential future football stars.
The partnership and joint venture between ŠKoDA in russia and the russian Ice Hockey Federation and National Ice Hockey Team has been 
extended to provide active support for youth sport in the country. The ŠKoDA Junior Ice Hockey Cup is a significant nationwide project aiming 
to encourage children’s interest in youth sport. The games are organized at professional venues, and famous ice hockey players share their  
experience with future professionals. In 2016, the company invited the winning team to the Ice Hockey World Championship 2016 in Moscow.
VW Commercial Vehicles has been cooperating with the charitable foundation Flag of Kindness in russia for over five years. Every year 
(including 2016), Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles helps the charity with its transport. The Cup of Kindness is a mini football cup organized 
across the country as part of the “under the Flag of Kindness” charity campaign, with 12 teams from well-known companies and enterprises,  
as well as famous actors, musicians, singers and sportsmen, who all compete in Moscow to raise money for charity and in particular for medical 
research into cures for seriously ill children.
Support for “Day of the City” in Kaluga (up to your decision if this is a relevant item)
Jointly with its dealers, Volkswagen Group russia traditionally supports “The Day of the City” in Kaluga, where the Group has a production 
facility. VW and ŠKoDA cars are showcased at the center of the festivities, and factory employees play an active part in the walking parade 
along the main streets of downtown, one of the major events of the year in Kaluga.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 
Group of America Joins the Fight Against Breast Cancer 
in september 2016, Volkswagen of America collaborated with The Pink Agenda, a 
non-profit devoted to eradicating breast cancer, along with breast cancer survivor 
and television personality giuliana Rancic and her FAB-U-WisH initiative, to help 
raise money for breast cancer research and improve the lives of those undergoing 
breast cancer treatment. As part of the collaboration, Volkswagen auctioned the first 
limited-edition 2017 Volkswagen #PinkBeetle to arrive in the U.s. market, raising 
$30,272.00, with proceeds benefiting The Pink Agenda’s and FAB-U-WisH’s efforts to 
fight against breast cancer. 
employees across the Volkswagen group of America network also celebrated #Pink-
Beetle Day to kick off the launch of Volkswagen’s new #PinkBeetle, in conjunction 
with Breast Cancer Awareness Month in october. Women in Motion (WiM) employee 
Resource group (eRg) chapters from VWgoA locations across the country planned 
company-wide fundraisers throughout the month to raise money and awareness 
for breast cancer research. VWgoA colleagues from across the country helped raise 
close to $10,000, with the company matching donations program, for breast cancer 
awareness.
in the same month, VW Chattanooga participated in the America Cancer society’s 
Making strides Against Breast Cancer event, where more than 2,500 supporters and 
140 teams raised $150,000 to help the ACs save lives from breast cancer.

Sponsoring Young Artists with Disabilities
Volkswagen group of America is proud of its ongoing relationship with the Kennedy 
Center and 14-year sponsorship of VsA’s work. VWgoA has provided more than 
$1 million in funding to support these accomplished artists, as well as underscoring 
its commitment to diversity and inclusion. The program, which annually features 
artwork by artists aged 16 to 25, supports individuals with disabilities during a critical 
time in their lives when many are deciding whether to pursue the arts as a career.
in september 2016, fifteen talented visual artists converged in Washington, D.C. for 
the culmination of the VsA emerging Young Artists Program. every year, this program 
awards outstanding young artists with disabilities with cash prizes, professional op-
portunities, and visibility for their work. Alongside a weekend of career development 
activities in D.C., the 2016 winners attended celebratory receptions on Capitol Hill and at the VWgoA’s headquarters Herndon, Va. Their 
artwork has embarked on a nine-month tour of galleries and schools throughout the United states. The professional connections and 
exposure that each winner receives through this program allow them to take profound steps in their artistic journeys and careers alike.
Volkswagen Group of American Employees Give Back
in 2016, more than 300 Volkswagen group of America employees volunteered 
approximately 900 hours with charitable organizations in the communities where 
they live and work as part of the company’s “get involved Month,” an initiative 
empowering employees across the country to support and give back to their com-
munities within a dedicated month of service. 
VWgoA also encourages employees to “get involved” year-round, providing robust 
incentives for employees to serve their communities. They include a matching 
employee donations initiative, a company-wide Dollars for Doers Program that 
provides a yearly one-time financial donation to a charity at which a full-time em-
ployee has volunteered for eight hours or more, and providing employees with  
a paid time off to volunteer.

About this RepoRt
REPORT STRUCTURE
The Volkswagen Group is committed to providing transparency to 
all its stakeholder groups. For the first time, this Group Sustainability 
Report 2017 includes a combined separate nonfinancial report that 
complies with sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 of the Handels-
gesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code), hereinafter referred to 
as the “nonfinancial report”. The nonfinancial report serves to meet 
the disclosure requirements of the CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz 
(CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implementation Act).   
In the Group Sustainability Report, all text passages, tables and  
graphics that form part of the nonfinancial report are indicated by a 
gray background. The Group Sustainability Report 2017 is supplemented  
by a detailed description of the sustainability activities of our brands 
and regions and of the Volkswagen Group’s CSR projects. This additional  
information, which does not form part of the nonfinancial report, can 
be found on the Volkswagen Group’s corporate website at:  
www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting 
Information on conflicting sustainability objectives and the “diesel 
issue” may be found in our separate sustainability magazine, Shift 2017.

REPORTING PRINCIPLES
For the first time, Volkswagen AG will issue a nonfinancial statement 
at company level for reporting year 2017 and a nonfinancial Group 
statement for reporting year 2017, which will be published together as 
a combined separate nonfinancial report in the sense of HGB sections 
289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 as part of the Group Sustainability  
Report 2017. The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with  
HGB sections 315b and 315c, in conjunction with sections 289c 
through 289e. Furthermore, the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) were used as the framework for drawing up the non-
financial report. In this nonfinancial report, Volkswagen has system-
atically used the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
as the underlying structure for the materiality analysis and reports 
on management approaches, as well as the specific standard disclo-
sures also included in the GRI Content Index. As required by CSR-RUG, 
this nonfinancial report concentrates on those action areas that are 
necessary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s business 
development, performance and position, as well as the Volkswagen 
Group’s influence on nonfinancial aspects. 
In terms of content, the Group Sustainability Report was prepared in 
compliance with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI), applying the “Comprehensive” option. At the same time, the  
GRI Content Index shows how we are implementing the requirements 
of the United Nations Global Compact (UN GC) and have committed 
ourselves to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  
as well as the criteria of the German Sustainability Code (DNK).
Important ideas for the report’s content were provided by the ques-
tionnaires and appraisals of sustainability-oriented rating agencies.  
We also took our lead from Stakeholder Engagement Standard AA1000.
To validate issues of material significance for the Volkswagen Group 
resulting from various global challenges, we drew upon the findings  
of the Volkswagen Group’s Stakeholder Panel, which has been in place 
for many years now, as well as the results of the latest comprehensive  
stakeholder surveys conducted by Group companies Audi, MAN, 
Porsche and Volkswagen Financial Services.
This sustainability report also takes account of the recommendations 
made by the previous Stakeholder Panel following the latter’s evalua-
tion of the Group Sustainability Report.
To manage its sustainability performance, the Volkswagen Group re-
cords strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance with 
the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the 
framework for ESG (environment, social and governance) indicators 
defined by the European Federation of Financial Analysts’ Societies 
(EFFAS). Increasingly, shareholders and investors are calling for trans-
parency, making them an important target group for our sustainability 
reporting. 
The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators presented 
in previous years. We have made no changes in the methods used to 
collect and measure the data on our sustainability performance. The 
Volkswagen Group’s global production network comprised 120 produc-
tion sites at the end of the reporting year. This is now the sixth time we 
have reported our emissions in line with Scope 3 of the WBCSD/WRI 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG).
In general, the KPIs relate to the entire Group. In addition to Volkswa-
gen AG, the Group includes all major subsidiaries inside and outside 
Germany that are directly or indirectly controlled by Volkswagen AG. 
In the financial data, our joint ventures in China are reported using the 
equity accounting method. However, they are included in full (100%) 
in volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) and environ-
mentally relevant data. 
 GRi 102-45, 102-48, 102-49 
 
REPORTING PRACTICES
The nonfinancial report and Group Sustainability Report are published 
annually. In addition to information about the Group’s sustainability 
activities in the 2017 fiscal year (1 January to 31 December 2017), the 
sustainability report also contains selected information from the 2018 
fiscal year. The editorial deadline was 6 February 2018, and both re-
ports appear in German and English. The next nonfinancial report will 
be published in the second quarter (Q2) of 2019, and we anticipate that 
the next Group Sustainability Report will also appear in Q2 2019. 
REPORT AUDIT
The combined separate nonfinancial report prepared in accordance 
with HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 was subjected to a 
voluntary, limited assurance audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC) in accordance with ISAE 3000 
(Revised), to verify that its disclosures comply with the principles of 
the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initia-
tive and the relevant statutory requirements. 
Further information on the audit can be found in the independent 
auditor’s remarks on nonfinancial reporting in the Independent 
Assurance Report.

ADDITIONAL REPORTING WITHIN THE GROUP
The nonfinancial report was drawn up in compliance with HGB 
section 315c in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. By 
referencing this combined separate nonfinancial report, all Group 
companies required by national legislation to disclose nonfinancial 
and diversity-related information pursuant to Directive 2014/95/EU 
are exempted from the obligation to submit their own nonfinancial 
reports. 
More detailed insights into our environmental management approach  
can be found in the environmental statements published by numer-
ous Group locations as part of their voluntary participation in the 
European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The sustain-
ability reports published by the Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania and 
ŠKODA brands also bear testimony to the Group’s commitment to 
sustainability.

FRAME OF REFERENCE
The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group as a 
whole. Where information relates to individual Group brands only, 
this is clearly indicated in the text. 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This sustainability report contains statements relating to the future 
business development of the Volkswagen Group. These statements 
are based on assumptions regarding the development of the eco-
nomic and legal conditions in individual countries and economic 
regions, in particular as they relate to the automotive industry, 
which we have made on the basis of the information available to us 
and which we consider to be realistic at the time of publication.  
The resulting estimates entail a degree of risk, and actual develop-
ments may differ from those predicted. Any changes in significant 
parameters relating to our key sales markets, or any significant 
shifts in exchange rates of relevance to the Volkswagen Group, will 
have a corresponding impact on the development of our business. 
In addition, there may be departures from our expected business 
development if the assessments of factors influencing sustainable 
value enhancement, and of risks and opportunities, presented in 
this sustainability report develop in a way other than we expect at 
the time of publication, or if additional risks and opportunities or 
other factors emerge that affect the development of our business.
CALCULATION OF FLEET EMISSIONS IN EUROPE
The figure for Group fleet CO₂ emissions is the figure annually record-
ed in the course of official monitoring pursuant to “Regulation (EC) 
443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 
2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars 
as part of the Community’s integrated approach to reduce CO₂ emis-
sions from light-duty vehicles” by the European Environment Agency 
(EEA) on behalf of the European Commission for the brands belong-
ing to the group of connected manufacturers “VW Group PC”. This 
figure is the volume-weighted average of all specific CO₂ emissions 
from new passenger cars registered for the first time in the respective 
calendar year, based on the calculation logic defined in EU Regula-
tion 443/2009. Provided that the figure for fleet CO₂ emissions is set 
down in a Commission Implementing Decision to confirm or amend 
the average specific CO₂ emissions and specific emissions targets for 
manufacturers of passenger cars for the respective calendar year in 
accordance with Regulation (EC) 443/2009 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council, this figure is published; otherwise, provisional CO₂ 
emission figures are published, which are evaluated on the basis of 
internal systems using the same logic.
NOTICE PURSUANT TO EU DIRECTIVE 1999/94 EC
Further information on the official fuel consumption and official  
specific CO₂ emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the 
“Guide on the Fuel Economy, CO₂ Emissions and Power Consumption of 
All New Passenger Car Models Offered for Sale on the German Market”, 
which can be obtained free of charge from all sales outlets of and directly

INDEX FOR THE NONFINANCIAL REPORT
The following index provides an overview of the disclosures required 
for the nonfinancial report in accordance with HGB section 315c in 
conjunction with sections 289c through 289e, together with appro-
priate references to the sections of this Group Sustainability Report 
in which these disclosures may be found. 
PwC has subjected the elements of the Group Sustainability Report 
that make up the nonfinancial report to a voluntary limited assur-
ance audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised).
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are indicated by a 
gray background. 
References to disclosures outside the summarized management 
report are supplementary information and do not form part of the 
nonfinancial report.
Based on various global challenges, the Volkswagen Group has drawn 
up a list of 18 key action areas. This analysis was based on external 
studies, industry analyses and stakeholder surveys, as well as internal 
policies and guidelines from our different divisions. These action 
areas were largely defined on the basis of the findings of expert work-
shops held in the past that addressed topics relating to the economy, 
the environment and civil society.
In the course of evaluating the statutory reporting requirements, 
Volkswagen expanded its materiality analysis and revised the action 
areas in terms of the requirements of the CSR Directive Implemen-
tation Act (CSR-RUG). In line with CSR-RUG, this nonfinancial report 
will concentrate on those action areas that are necessary for an under - 
standing of the Volkswagen Group’s business development, overall 
performance and position, as well as the Volkswagen Group’s influ-
ence on nonfinancial aspects.
The Volkswagen Group’s action areas were evaluated in terms of  
their strategic importance for TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 and their 
stakeholder relevance. In addition, the implications of CSR-RUG for  
the disclosure of nonfinancial information were discussed with 
representatives of the brands and corporate functions in four work-
shops. Furthermore, the significance of what is known as the “impact 
outlook” for the evaluation of action areas for the Volkswagen Group 
was discussed in the Group CSR Meeting (GCM).
In the course of this process, Volkswagen identified a total of 11 
material aspects as defined in CSR-RUG. A detailed description of 
this materiality process can be found in the section on Strategy and 
Management on page 28.

Strategy and 
Management
As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, our Group bears a  
special social responsibility. We wish to put our creative powers to good use  
for the benefit of people and the environment. Every year we produce more than 
10 million vehicles. This gives rise to positive effects – such as new jobs,  
regional prosperity and individual opportunities for participation – but also to  
negative impacts, due above all to emissions and resource consumption. And in 
 view of the growing trend toward digitalization, we will be obliged to confront  
new issues in the future – what we do with our customers’ data, for example,  
how we ensure this data is secure and protected at all times, and what legal and  
ethical quandaries are raised by automated driving.

DEAR READERS, 
In real terms, what will mobility look like the day after tomorrow? How important will the car be as a 
means of transport? When will artificial intelligence finally replace the driver? None of these questions 
can be answered with absolute certainty today. Only one thing is certain. The scope of the change facing 
the Volkswagen Group, and indeed the entire automotive industry, is more wide-reaching than anything 
our industry has experienced in its 130-year history.
In truth, our Company faces a dual challenge. We have not yet surmounted the diesel crisis for which we 
ourselves are responsible; its consequences will continue to weigh on us for the foreseeable future. We have 
taken significant steps to strengthen our internal processes and control mechanisms, and to refocus on 
compliance and integrity – by revising our Code of Conduct, for example, and extending our whistleblower 
system. We continue to work on the renewal of our corporate culture, by flattening our hierarchies, giving 
our employees more personal responsibility and decentralizing our management, and by drawing up our 
Code of Cooperation as a platform for open collaboration in and between our Group companies. 
But all these initiatives, as well as the impressive commitment of our workforce to this process of change, 
must take a back seat when news of the misconduct and poor judgments that unfortunately took place 
within our Company once again becomes public. And it shows that both as a Company and as an industry, 
we must deal much more seriously and sensitively with ethical issues, and act even more decisively on 
sustainability issues. 
In our program for the future, TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, we clearly describe our way forward into a 
new world of mobility. Our plans build on Volkswagen’s qualities: our innovative strength, our technical 
expertise, the enormous commitment of our employees around the world. But we also set ourselves new 
priorities. For example, Roadmap E, published in September 2017, put flesh on the bones of our electrifi-
cation strategy. By 2025, our Group companies will make more than 80 new electric models available to 
our customers. By 2030, we will electrify our entire model portfolio. By doing so, we are convinced that 
the Volkswagen Group can make a significant contribution to boosting the e-mobility breakthrough. 
Living up to this self-imposed commitment will not only require a great deal of effort, but also a great deal 
of money. Over the next few years, we will be investing more than €34 billion in e-mobility, autonomous 
driving, digitalization and new mobility services. The lion’s share will be spent on electrification. This is 
how we will turn Volkswagen into a pioneer of zero-emission mobility. As far as our Group is concerned, 
the transport revolution and the energy revolution are inseparably intertwined. 
E-mobility is still in its infancy. And there are still many unresolved questions regarding the e-mobility 
value chain and product life cycle – from raw materials and energy production through to infrastructure 
and recycling. As the Volkswagen Group, we are helping to answer these questions, both by contributing 
our expertise and by assuming responsibility.

Volkswagen will play a courageous, consistent and responsible role in the systemic shift to new drive  
technologies. And we will do so without neglecting current technologies and vehicle projects. This is  
how we will earn money today so we can invest it in tomorrow.  
The recommendations of the Group Sustainability Council we appointed in 2016 should help to restore 
the trust and confidence of our employees, our customers and the general public. By working together, we 
aim to prepare our Group for the future, molding Volkswagen into the perfect model of a corporation that 
operates sustainably, with integrity – and is at the same time commercially successful. 
For a long time, Volkswagen could be found at the top of the most prestigious sustainability indices – and 
we aim to reclaim that position. As a Group, our intrinsic mission is to make a key contribution to solving 
critical problems. We want to work with others to mitigate climate change and improve urban air quality. 
This is why we are setting ourselves new, ambitious production targets. By 2025, we intend to reduce neg-
ative environmental impacts in our production plants by a further 20%. This means 45% less energy, CO₂, 
water, solvents and waste per vehicle compared with our 2010 baseline.
Traditionally, the social aspects of sustainability are very important to us at Volkswagen. Consequently, 
even at a time when the automotive industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation, we continue 
 to regard economic success and job security as equal priorities. We want to help shape the future of 
work in an increasingly digitalized world. We are committed to equal opportunities, education, stronger 
social values and support for disadvantaged people in all walks of life. Many thousands of our employees 
around the world are also working as volunteers in social and environmental projects. By doing so, they 
are making an important contribution to social cohesion – even outside the factory gates.
The Sustainability Report for 2017 before you will give you an insight into our efforts. To make the disclosures, 
figures and data in this report transparent, understandable and easy to compare, we have followed the guide-
lines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  
of the United Nations. This report also represents our Communication on Progress under the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC) and serves as our Nonfinancial Declaration under the CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungs-
gesetz (CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implementation Act). 
We look forward to receiving your suggestions and feedback.

Annual Report 2017.
The diesel crisis was made public on September 18, 2015 – a date 
etched in the Group’s collective memory. Key events are shown in the 
timeline below. 
The diesel issue prompted a process by which we strengthened our 
corporate culture, particularly in the areas of compliance and inter-
nal control mechanisms. This development led to the initiation of 
programs and projects designed to intensify Volkswagen’s collective 
awareness of integrity.  
We honed our internal control systems for the product development 
process and vehicle testing, overhauled our Code of Conduct and the 
whistleblower system, and increased the frequency of the training 
courses provided to staff on these topics. 
The combination of integrity, compliance and culture is an important 
and indispensable part of the transformation process we are under-
going. We are renewing ourselves from the inside out and are evolving 
on a daily basis to merit our most important asset – the trust of our 
customers and shareholders.  
Our exhaustive investigation continues; it also touches on a wide 
range of legal issues. Further information on this complex subject 
area can be found in the Management Report in our Annual Report 
2017. A critical analysis also appears in our sustainability magazine,

PRODUCTS
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups in the 
automotive industry. The Company’s business activities comprise the 
Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All brands in the Auto-
motive Division – with the exception of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands – are independent legal 
entities.  
The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Commercial  
Vehicles and Power Engineering Business Areas. The Volkswagen 
Group’s passenger car brands are mostly consolidated in the Passenger 
Cars Business Area. This Business Area focuses primarily on developing 
vehicles and engines, producing and selling passenger cars, and dealing 
in original (genuine Volkswagen) parts. The product portfolio extends 
from fuel-efficient small cars through to luxury vehicles in the premi-
um segment, and also includes motorcycles, and will successively be 
supplemented by mobility services. 
The Commercial Vehicles Business Area focuses above all on the devel-
opment, production and sale of light commercial vehicles, trucks and 
buses under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN 
brands, supported by our original parts business and related services. 
Collaboration between commercial-vehicle brands MAN and Scania  
is managed and coordinated under the umbrella of Volkswagen  
Truck & Bus GmbH. The Commercial Vehicles Business Area’s portfolio 
ranges from pickups to heavy trucks and buses. 
The Power Engineering Business Area manages business activities 
involving large-bore diesel engines, turbomachinery, special gear units, 
propulsion components and testing systems. 
The activities of the Financial Services Division comprise dealer and 
customer financing, vehicle leasing, banking and insurance activities, 
as well as fleet management and Mobility offerings. 
With its brands, the Volkswagen Group has a presence in all relevant 
markets around the world, with Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil 
and Mexico currently representing its key sales markets.
LOCATIONS AND EMPLOYEES
The Volkswagen Group’s production network is comprised of 120 loca-
tions in which passenger cars, commercial vehicles and motorcycles, 
as well as powertrains and components are manufactured.
With 71 locations, Europe remains our most important production 
region for vehicles and components. There are 28 sites in Germany 
alone. The Asia-Pacific region has 31 locations. We have five locations 
in North America and nine in South America. The Group operates four 
locations in Africa.
MARKETS
Despite difficult economic conditions, the Group – including our 
Chinese joint ventures – delivered a total of 10,741,455 cars and com-
mercial vehicles in 2017. The Group was able to maintain its strong 
competitive position in the reporting period thanks to a wide range of 
attractive and environmentally friendly vehicles. Worldwide, for the 
manufacture of its products, the Group purchased goods and services 
with a total value of €173.6 billion. This includes purchasing figures 
for our Chinese joint-venture companies.

RECYCLING
year for year, the Volkswagen Group invests more in research and development than any 
other automotive company in the world, laying the foundations for new models and 
innovative concepts with which to master the challenges of the future: digitalization, 
networking and electric mobility (e-mobility).
every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of 43,000 vehicles. 
efficient production ranks alongside employee health and safety as one of our core goals. 
New concepts help prepare employees for the future, covering every step from vocational 
training onwards.
our service provision includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality 
advice and maintenance, managing our original parts business, and providing innovative 
vehicle-related financial services. Driver training courses in fuel-efficient driving play an 
effective part in cutting fuel consumption and thus co₂ emissions.
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ impact on the environment and conserv-
ing resources. this is not just about recycling vehicles at the end of their useful life; recycling starts 
at the new-vehicle development stage, during which we pay close attention to the recyclability of the 
required materials, the use of high-quality recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants. At the 
same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, for instance the treatment and disposal of service 
fluids and high-wear components.
every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, components 
and other goods. A sustainable supply chain and environmentally compatible transporta-
tion play key roles in our responsible and comprehensive championing of human rights, 
environmental protection and the battle against corruption.
the Volkswagen Group markets its vehicles in 153 countries. Around the world, comfort 
and safety are considered the key customer requirements. we continuously reduce our 
models’ fuel consumption and offer alternative mobility services.

In 2016, the inception of TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 launched the 
biggest change process in the history of Volkswagen. Our new program 
for the future is making the Volkswagen Group more focused, efficient, 
innovative and sustainable – bringing us closer to our customers and 
setting us on a steady course of profitable growth. It defines the frame-
work and key building blocks of our vision – to become a world-leading 
provider of sustainable mobility.
Setting our sights on 2025 shows that we are thinking and acting  
long-term, looking forward to the future. The term “TOGETHER” de-
scribes the collective mindset within the Volkswagen Group, which will 
be even more important for our sustainable success going forward. 
With the help of this Group strategy, we in the Volkswagen Group are 
working together to thrill our customers with amazing vehicles and 
advanced, flexible mobility solutions – building a portfolio of strong 
brands that will meet their many different needs now and in the 
future. 
Every day, we assume and exercise responsibility for the environ-
ment, safety and society, as we seek to become a role model in these 
areas. Integrity, reliability, quality and passion are the cornerstones 
of our work. By pursuing these goals and principles, we strive for 
techno logical leadership in the industry, strengthen our competitive 
profitability and, at the same time, remain an excellent, safe and 
dependable employer.
The Code of Collaboration that forms part of our program for the  
future is the foundation on which our Group strategy rests. It describes 
how we cooperate within the Group and in our daily interactions, 
based on such core values as “open and honest”, “uncomplicated”, 
“without prejudice”, “on an equal footing” and “for one another”.
THE FOUR BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR PROGRAM FOR 
THE FUTURE: TOGETHER – STRATEGY 2025
Our Group strategy comprises a raft of far-reaching strategic decisions 
and practical initiatives, all essentially aiming to safeguard the Group’s 
long-term future and generate profitable growth. It comprises four 
building blocks, embracing a total of 16 strategic Group initiatives. 
The first building block is the transformation of our core automotive 
business. Developing, building and selling vehicles will remain essen-
tial for the Volkswagen Group going forward. However, there will be 
far-reaching and lasting changes to this business in the future. This is 
why we are comprehensively restructuring our core business for this 
new era of mobility. 
Establishing a new mobility solutions business is the second building 
block of our Group strategy. Within this business area, we are develop-
ing innovative and efficient mobility services that are also attractive, 
profitable and tailored to customer requirements – with the aim of be-
ing one of the leading provider in this growth market moving forward.
With the third building block, we are boosting the Group’s traditional 
innovative strengths and placing them on an even broader footing. 
This is necessary not only for the transformation of our core business, 
but also for building our new mobility services business. To this end, 
we are pushing ahead with the digital transformation of all parts of 
the Company. 
We aim to achieve lasting success in tomorrow’s world of mobility by evolving into a global leader 
in the provision of sustainable mobility. With this in mind, we have embedded our program for 
the future, TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, at the heart of our corporate activities.

Becoming one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable  mobility 
calls for substantial capital expenditure. This investment is to be 
funded primarily through efficiency gains along the entire value chain – 
from product development and sourcing through to production and 
distribution, as well as in our corporate support functions. We can 
also generate additional resources for future investments by optimiz-
ing our existing portfolio of brands and equity investments. Bringing 
us to the fourth building block of our Group strategy, which involves 
securely financing the Volkswagen Group and placing it on a solid

GROUP STRATEGY GOALS AND KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS  
Our strategic initiatives describe how we intend to achieve our vision 
of becoming a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility. For this 
purpose, we have defined four target dimensions – thrilled customers;  
excellent employer; role model for the environment, safety and in-
tegrity; and competitive profitability – which are intended to help us 
grow sustainably.
These target dimensions apply across the Group. However, the strategic 
KPIs which we will use to measure our future progress in implement-
ing our Group strategy will differ according to business model. This is 
because our car-manufacturing brands have a different business model 
from our truck and bus brands, which in turn differs from the business 
models of our Power Engineering and service businesses.
Below we describe the Group strategic goals which have been assigned to 
each of the target dimensions.
The definitions of the strategic KPIs for the target dimension of com-
petitive profitability have been standardized and established across 
the Group. In some cases, however, the substance of the strategic KPIs 
for the other target dimensions is still being defined as we continue 
to flesh out our Group strategy.
TARGET DIMENSION: THRILLED CUSTOMERS
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our customers  
and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to exceed our 
customers’ expectations and generate maximum customer benefit. 
This calls not only for the best products, the most efficient solutions 
and the best service, but also for flawless quality and an outstanding 
corporate image. We want to thrill our existing customers, win over 
new ones and retain their loyalty in the long term – because only loyal 
and faithful customers will recommend us to others.
Our strategic KPIs include the Net Promoter Score, conquest rate and 
key indicators for loyalty, customer satisfaction and retention.

TARGET DIMENSION: EXCELLENT EMPLOYER
Skilled and dedicated employees are one of the keys to sustainable 
success. We seek to boost our employees’ job satisfaction and motiva-
tion by offering equal opportunities, a modern and attractive working 
environment, and a forward-looking work organization. This offering 
is based on exemplary leadership and corporate culture, enabling us 
to retain our core workforce and attract new talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension cover internal employer 
attractiveness determined by means of the opinion survey, external 
employer attractiveness, an external employer ranking as well as a 
KPI pertaining to cross-brand exchange and rotation and the diversity 
index.
TARGET DIMENSION: ROLE MODEL FOR  
THE ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND INTEGRITY
Every day, we in the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise responsi-
bility for the environment, safety and society. This sense of responsi-
bility informs all our thoughts, actions and all the decisions we make, 
in equal measure.
We pay particular attention to the resources used and emissions gen-
erated by our product portfolio, as well as our locations and plants. 
Our goal is to continuously reduce our carbon footprint and lower 
our pollutant emissions. Through our innovations and outstanding 
quality, we seek to meet the highest standards of product safety. 
Our paramount principles include compliance with laws and regula-
tions, the establishment of safe, reliable processes, and open acknowl-
edgment of mistakes so they can be avoided or rectified in the future. 
In terms of integrity, Volkswagen aims to become the role model for a 
modern, transparent and successful enterprise.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension include the decarbonization 
index, KPIs pertaining to emissions figures, as well as to compliance, 
process reliability and a culture of dealing openly with mistakes.  
TARGET DIMENSION: COMPETITIVE PROFITABILITY
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations 
with respect to interest payments and debt repayments. As equity 
holders, they expect suitable dividends and a lasting increase in the 
value of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth and 
strengthening our competitiveness, thereby keeping the Volkswagen 
Group on a firm footing and ensuring it remains an attractive invest-
ment option.
To achieve operational excellence in all business processes, and to 
become an industry benchmark – those are the goals we have set 
ourselves.
Here, our strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen Group 
figures.

ing strategy aimed at inspiring customers on a whole new level under 
the slogan “customer delight”. We regard ourselves as an innovative 
and sustainable mobility provider for all commercial and private 
customers worldwide – with a unique product portfolio encompassing 
twelves successful brands and innovative financial services.
We will implement the TOGETHER sales strategy step by step over 
the coming years. In the focus area of new sales, for example, we are 
realizing innovative sales and service strategies together with our 
sales partners. In the focus area of the customer ecosystem, we are 
implementing platforms for a seamless digital brand experience at 
all customer touchpoints – this is enabling us to meet ever-grow-
ing customer expectations as well as increased data protection 
standards. In the focus area of steering, we are optimizing how our 
brands capitalize profitably on market opportunities. 
Optimal coverage of markets, customer segments and customer bud-
gets are at the heart of a strategic Group initiative. To this end, we are 
establishing automobile-specific customer segmentation to steer the 
positioning of our brands. At the same time, we are examining global 
markets for potential revenue sources. In 2017, we rolled out this 
methodology in Europe and China and agreed on the region-specific, 
customer-oriented brand territories for product positioning. From 
2018, the new methodology will be applied in the Volkswagen Group’s 
product processes; other brands will also be included.
The Volkswagen Group aims its sales activities at inspiring its cus-
tomers. This is our top priority, as enthusiastic customers remain 
loyal to our brands and recommend our products and services to 
others. In addition to satisfaction with our products and services, we  
value our customers’ emotional connection to our brands. It is im-
portant for us to retain customers and win new ones. To measure 
our success in this area, we collect data on and analyze three strategic 
indicators for the major passenger car-producing brands:
 § Net promoter score: Proportion of customers who would recom-
mend us to others minus the proportion of customers who would 
not recommend us. In terms of customers’ willingness to recom-
mend them, Porsche and ŠKODA lead the core European markets 
when compared to other Group brands and competitors.
 § Loyalty rate: Proportion of customers of our car brands who have 
bought another Group model. The loyalty of Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars, Audi, Porsche and ŠKODA customers has kept these brands 
in the upper loyalty rankings in comparison with competitors for 
a number of years. Compared to other manufacturer groups, the 
Volkswagen Group therefore holds the top spot, with a considerable 
margin over the competition.
 § Conquest rate: Newly acquired passenger car customers as a propor-
tion of all potential new customers. Here, too, we have a top ranking, 
primarily thanks to the good scores for the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand. 
The downward trend in brand image and brand trust at the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars brand following the diesel issue did not continue in 
2017. Instead, the first signs of recovery were evident. Porsche remains 
in top position in the image ranking.
We also use a strategic indicator to measure the satisfaction of cus-
tomers with our products and services in the truck and bus business:
 § Customer satisfaction: In the markets relevant for the Volkswagen 
Group, we aim to be one of the industry leaders in terms of the 
satisfaction rate for our commercial vehicle brands. To evaluate 
these criteria, we use customer satisfaction studies, which delivered 
positive satisfaction figures in line with our targets in the report-
ing period. 
In the financial services business, we use two strategic indicators:
 § Customer satisfaction: In addition to looking at customer satisfac-
tion with our products, we measure this by examining reviews of 
our service staff; both aspects are an indicator for our customer and 
service focus. The results continued their positive trend in 2017. 
To achieve our goal of very high customer satisfaction throughout 
the Financial Services Division by 2025, we regularly evaluate what 
action is needed and how ideas can be shared and implemented 
across different countries.
 § Customer loyalty: Trust in and loyalty to our services rely on cus-
tomer satisfaction with our product range and service. The loyalty 
scores that are regularly calculated based on product sales to our 
customers are impressive proof of customers’ trust in our financial 
services. Ambitious targets underscore the focus on customers and 
fulfilling their needs at Volkswagen Financial Services.

E-MOBILITY AND DIGITALIZATION IN GROUP SALES
By 2025, as part of our Roadmap E, we plan to offer our customers 
around the world more than 80 new electric models, including some 
50 pure battery-driven vehicles and 30 plug-in hybrids. This campaign 
will be complemented by vehicle-related, customer-focused offers, 
such as customized charging infrastructure solutions and mobile  
online services. This is turning the Volkswagen Group from an 
automotive manufacturer into a mobility service provider, posing 
completely new sales challenges.
We are making highly targeted use of the opportunities of digitali-
zation in sales. Our actions are guided by a clearly defined strategy 
that requires extensive cooperation between the brands to achieve 
the greatest possible synergies. Our aim here is to create a completely 
new product experience for our customers – one which is impressive 
with its seamless customer communications, from the initial interest 
in purchasing a vehicle, to servicing, and ultimately to the sale of the 
used car. In the process, we are thus opening up new business models 
and opportunities in every aspect of the connected vehicle – in par-
ticular mobility and other services. Vehicles are becoming an integral 
part of the customer’s digital world of experience. We take great care to 
make all processes transparent so that customers always retain control 
of their own data.
We also gear our internal processes and structures to the pace of 
digital innovation. The result is project teams operating across 
different business areas, new forms of cooperation, a more intensive 
relationship with the international start-up scene, a consolidation of 
venture capital expertise – as a form of supporting innovative ideas 
and business models – as well as new lean systems and cloud-based 
IT solutions.
FLEET CUSTOMER BUSINESS  
Our business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term 
partnerships. In a volatile environment, this customer group guaran-
tees more stable vehicle sales than the private customer segment.
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet 
customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular. Our ex-
tensive product range enables us to satisfy their individual mobility 
needs from a single source.
In fiscal year 2017, the share of fleet customers in total registrations 
in Germany remained stable at 14.1% (14.1%) amid a 2.7% growth in 
the market. The Volkswagen Group’s share of this customer segment 
decreased to 44.7% (47.1%). Outside Germany, we recorded growth 
in the Group’s share of registrations by fleet customers in Europe to 
25.2% (24.5%). On the whole, the Volkswagen Group’s share in Europe 
remained constant at 28.9% (28.9%). This shows that fleet customers 
still have considerable confidence in the Group.
AFTER SALES AND SERVICE 
In addition to individual service, the timely provision of genuine 
parts is essential in ensuring passenger car customer satisfaction in 
After Sales. The genuine parts supplied by our passenger cars brands 
and the expertise of the service centers represent the highest level of 
quality and ensure the safety and value retention of our customers’ 
vehicles. With our global after-sales network including more than  
120 of our own warehouses, we ensure that almost all our authorized 
service facilities around the world can be supplied within 24 hours. 
We regard ourselves as a complete provider of all products and ser-
vices relevant to customers in the after-sales business. Together with 
our partners, we ensure the worldwide mobility of our customers. The 
partner businesses offer the entire portfolio of services in all vehicle 
classes. We are continuously expanding our range of tailored services 
in order to improve convenience for our customers and increase 
customer satisfaction.
Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also prides itself 
on products of the highest quality and on strong customer focus. Our 
range of trucks, buses and engines is complemented by services that 
guarantee fuel efficiency, reliability and good vehicle availability. The 
workshop service and service contracts offer customers a high degree 
of certainty in addition to high quality. We are reducing servicing 
times and costs with a view to reducing vehicles’ total operating costs 
and helping them retain their value. 
In the Power Engineering segment, we help our customers ensure the 
availability of machinery with MAN PrimeServ. The global network 
of more than 100 PrimeServ locations guarantees excellent customer 
focus and offers, among other things, replacement parts of genuine 
parts quality, qualified technical service and long-term maintenance 
contracts.

stRAteGy AND MANAGeMeNt  |  sustAiNAble Mobility
It is our task to ensure responsible and efficient production, and to 
make mobility not only as safe, convenient and environmentally com-
patible as possible, but also affordable for large numbers of people. 
We have firmly established e-mobility as a key action area in our 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 program for the future – while at the same 
time setting out our goal of becoming one of the world’s leading 
providers of e-mobility by 2025. Coupled with e-mobility and auto-
nomous driving, digitalization will transform our business – with 
implications of which many people are not yet aware. 
As we work to develop pioneering mobility solutions, we do not limit 
our focus to automotive mobility, but also consider other modes of 
transportation, as well as issues such as urbanization, urban develop-
ment, traffic-related services and the quality of transport infrastructure. 
We also take account of trending demands, such as vehicle-sharing. For 
these reasons, we have embedded new mobility solutions and digital 
services as core elements in our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 program. 
By 2025, we intend to generate a proportion of our revenues from 
mobility solutions. With the Volkswagen Group’s new company for 
mobility services, MOIA, we are laying the foundations of lasting suc-
cess in tomorrow’s world of mobility – across the Group, and across 
all our brands. MOIA develops and markets its own mobility services, 
either independently or in partnership with cities and existing trans-
port systems. In parallel with MOIA, the brands continue to move 
forward with their own specific services. 
We are working on other innovative mobility concepts as part of 
the #WolfsburgDigital initiative. We recently made our on-demand 
X-Shuttle service available to our employees. Five modified Volkswagen 
Crafters transport commuters between our Braunschweig and Wolfs-
burg sites – they even provide a traveling concierge service. Group em-
ployees can use a smartphone app to specify their pickup location and 
destination and book the shuttle digitally. An algorithm combines the 
commuters’ requests, figures out optimal routes, and calculates travel 
and arrival times for each passenger. And the X-Shuttle service offers 
additional benefits – parcel and laundry services, snacks and drinks, 
free Wi-Fi and smartphone charging ports. X-Shuttle is more than just 
a ridesharing service; it is a pilot for future concepts in urban mobility 
and conceivably the future of carpooling. 
In the future, autonomous vehicles will enrich many people’s 
mobility experience. A mobility concept based on heavily used 
autonomous vehicles will take up less space, consume less energy, 
and be significantly safer and more sustainable. With SEDRIC (for 
SElf-DRIving Car), not only have we created precisely such an innova-
tive, integrated mobility concept for the urban traffic of the future, 
we have also developed a totally new kind of concept car. SEDRIC is 
a cross-brand ideas platform for our Group. It features an intuitive 
control system that gives an entirely new meaning to the idea of 
autonomous driving. The touch of a button, a verbal command or a 
smartphone app is enough to summon the self-driving automobile, 
which then delivers its passengers conveniently, reliably and safely to 
their destinations.

Sustainable Mobility
MOIA
Just one year after its inception, MOIA has introduced an in-
tegrated ride-pooling concept with a mission: “One Million 
Cars off the Road”. Starting in 2018, the initiative will provide 
new mobility options aimed at significantly reducing traffic 
in cities. We will launch this mobility service in 2018, initially 
in Hamburg.
MOIA has been testing the service in Hanover since October 
2017 and is continuously developing the various components 
based on real-world operation. A fleet of 20 Volkswagen  
Multivans is currently being used for the tests. 
Thanks to the MOIA ridesharing vehicle we introduced in 
December 2017, we can now cover the entire ride-pooling 
value chain – or just individual links in the chain, as required.

Starting in 2018, in a further step along the road to a new world 
of digitized mobility, we are planning to join forces with Israeli 
company Mobileye to implement a new navigation standard for 
automated driving. Future Volkswagen models will use Mobileye’s 
Road Experience Management™ (REM™) camera-based mapping and 
localization technology. 
 
However, the economic, social and environmental requirements our 
mobility solutions must satisfy often contain a number of inherent-
ly conflicting goals. Whenever we fail to achieve a balance between 
economic, social and environmental objectives, long-term risks 
emerge both for our stakeholders and for the financial success of 
our Group. Some examples of such conflicting goals include:
 § Individual mobility solutions facilitate participation in society and 
individual autonomy. In the future, many people will still want to 
run their own cars – despite the steadily increasing availability of 
innovative mobility concepts. This is particularly true of the growing 
consumer markets in emerging and developing countries, as well as 
sparsely populated regions. However, the desire for individual mobil-
ity also contributes to increased consumption of natural resources 
and accelerates the process of anthropogenic climate change.

Mobileye can be found at: https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/
 § The market success of SUVs underscores the attractiveness of 
Volkswagen products. Fulfilling these existing customer wishes 
safeguards the business success of our Group and provides job 
security for our employees. But the higher fuel consumption of SUVs 
compared with other vehicle models makes it more difficult for us to 
meet the climate targets we have set ourselves.
 § Government legislation, and especially changes to regulations 
governing CO₂ emissions, have made ecologically driven structural 
change inevitable. However, this far-reaching change poses a chal-
lenge to existing production methods and workforce qualifications. 
At the same time, the shift toward e-mobility and the associated 
investments in production capacity are also generating new employ-
ment opportunities.
 § Electric mobility also raises new environmental questions, such as 
how to measure the environmental impact of electric and hybrid 
vehicles compared with conventional vehicles in terms of the use of 
mineral resources in production and the recycling of battery cells at 
the end of the product life cycle.
 § Automated vehicles and new mobility services offer more 
convenience, enhance road safety, and encourage optimization 
of transport and traffic systems, especially in heavily populated 
urban areas. The new demand for collective mobility is creating a 
new competitive environment with brand-new players, to which 
we must continually adapt.
 § Connected driving and digitalization depend on data sharing 
and big data analysis, but we must also comply with legislation 
governing personal data protection. Before automated mobility 
can succeed, we need to clarify a large number of ethical and legal 
questions.

Sustainable 
Management
Our aim is to operate responsibly along the entire value chain. This 
means our corporate governance must be sustainable and transparent 
to its core. 
Largely in line with the recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code, we practice Group-wide sustainability coordina-
tion, integrated compliance and risk management, the continued 
development of a culture of integrity, and responsible supply chain 
management. The forward-thinking handling of environmental is-
sues, responsibility toward our employees and social engagement by 
our brands and in the various regions provide the framework for our 
Group’s sustainability approach. The greatest challenge to effective 
sustainability management is our complexity, with our 12 brands, 
more than 640,000 employees and 120 production sites.
Voluntary undertakings and principles applied across the Group form 
the basis and backbone of our sustainability management. These 
include our Model of Sustainable Development, our stakeholder guide-
lines and our corporate guidelines.
The Model of Sustainable Development provides a benchmark for 
sustainable corporate policy with three key elements:
 § a lasting balance between economic, environmental and social 
systems and our efforts to achieve long-term equilibrium between 
divergent interests,
 § responsibility for our own actions at regional, national and global 
level, with
 § transparent communications and fair cooperation. 
COORDINATION OF SUSTAINABILITY
We have created a clear structure for coordinating our sustainability 
activities that includes internal and external sustainability committees.
Our internal sustainability coordination is based on the tight inte-
gration of our corporate and sustainability strategies. In 2017, in its 
function as our Sustainability Board, the Group Board of Management 
under the leadership of CEO Matthias Müller regularly worked on the 
strategic issues surrounding a holistic sustainability management 
approach.
The Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee regularly updates 
the Group Board of Management on issues of relevance to sustain-
ability. The steering committee includes top managers from corporate 
functions, as well as representatives of the Group Works Council and 
brands. Its tasks include defining strategic sustainability goals and 
position statements, identifying key action areas and approving the 
sustainability report. Management indicators are used to monitor the 
extent to which these sustainability goals are being met. The steering 
committee meets regularly under the leadership of the external affairs 
and sustainability function.
In turn, the steering committee is supported by the sustainability office. 
Its duties include coordinating all sustainability-related activities with-
in the Group and the brands. The office also handles the monitoring 
and coordination of sustainability ratings. Finally, it is responsible for 
drawing up the sustainability report and supporting the Sustainability 
Council and its workshops.
As part of the environmental and socio-political regulatory process, 
we also maintain an ongoing dialog with policymakers.
At divisional level, the CSR project team ensures that information on 
current projects is regularly shared between the various sustainability 
experts within the Group. In addition, other project teams work across 
business areas on topics such as reporting, stakeholder management 
and sustainability in supplier relations. These coordination and work-
ing structures have also been established across the brands and are 
subject to ongoing development. 
In our efforts to continuously improve our sustainability concept, we 
have set up two external committees to provide us with independent 
advice: the Sustainability Council and the Stakeholder Panel.
Appointed in 2016, the international Sustainability Council regularly 
consults with the Board of Management, senior managers and em-
ployee representatives. It is authorized to proactively propose topics 
and implement projects subject to prior agreement. Its first projects 
included an investigation of innovation and cultural change related 
to sustainable mobility, an international initiative related to crisis 
prevention as a consequence of climate change, and a scientific study 
on defining the future parameters of transportation and climate 
policy. More detailed information on the council’s members and 
activities can be found here: www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability 
> Sustainability Council.

In cooperation with experts in the field, we set up a Stakeholder Panel 
that has kept track of our sustainability reporting in particular over 
the past 20 years and provided a critical commentary. In 2017, the 
panel included some 200 national and international stakeholders 
from government, academia and research, the financial markets and 
civil society. We regularly conduct interviews and apply the findings 
in order to refine our understanding of our external stakeholders’ 
expectations.
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 
GRi 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 102-49
Our approach to the analysis and identification of significant issues is 
as follows:
1. Based on various global challenges, we drew up a list of 18 key 
action areas. We did this on the basis of the following sources: 
external studies, industry analyses and our brands’ stakeholder 
surveys, as well as internal guidelines such as the Group-wide 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 and the individual strategies of our 
divisions. These action areas were largely defined on the basis 
of the findings of expert workshops held in the past addressing 
topics related to the economy, the environment and civil society.
2. In August, “Group Guideline No. 25: Sustainability Reporting” 
was approved by the Group Board of Management. This policy 
regulates organization and responsibilities, and also defines the 
process for the annual materiality analysis. 
3. The changeover to the new sustainability reporting framework of 
the Global Reporting Initiative – the GRI Standards –, which will 
become mandatory in July 2018, was carried out in cooperation 
with external experts. 
4. Following our evaluation of the modified reporting requirements 
and in line with the strategic approach of TOGETHER – Strategy 
2025, we have expanded our materiality analysis. Going forward, 
we will further intensify our focus on a holistic approach to 
sustainability which takes account of the Group perspective, the 
perceptions of our stakeholders, and the environmental, economic 
and social impacts of our business. For this reason, as a first step, 
we have decided to extend our key action areas to include the 
issues of integrity and human rights.
5. The 18 action areas identified by the Volkswagen Group were 
evaluated in terms of their strategic importance for TOGETHER – 
Strategy 2025 and their stakeholder relevance. 
6. In 2017, the implications of CSR-RUG (for the disclosure of 
nonfinancial information) and of the new GRI standards were 
discussed with representatives of the brands and corporate func-
tions in four workshops, and subsequently reconciled with our 
divisional strategies. 
7. Furthermore, in the Group CSR Meeting (GCM), we discussed the 
importance of taking an “impact perspective” when evaluating 
the action areas for our Group.
 
The outcome of this systematic materiality process was that, due to 
our size, our impacts and our resulting responsibilities, all minimum 
disclosure requirements under CSR-RUG were once again identified as 
material. This also applies to all topics defined as “material” by the GRI 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative. The graphic below shows 
our material action areas in line with CSR-RUG and the GRI Standards:

The specific content of the action areas in terms of objectives, values 
and indicators is still being fleshed out as part of the implementation 
of our new Group strategy. 
Our relationships with our stakeholders, as well as their requirements, 
expectations and attitudes, are of fundamental importance in identi-
fying issues of material significance for the Volkswagen Group. For this 
reason, in addition to our established Stakeholder Panel and the stake-
holder surveys carried out by the Group companies, we have worked 
with other internal and external representatives to further refine our 
key action areas.
The graphic below shows the Group’s most important action areas in 
the view of our stakeholders. Our desk research focused on the inter-
ests of more than 40 national and international stakeholder groups 
whose concerns formed part of a multi-stage analysis which informed 
the identification of our action areas:
* This analysis is based on the action areas defined in 2015 and stakeholder perspectives at that time.

In view of our broad international standing, we have deliberately 
avoided any prioritization of these action areas. On the one hand, the 
relevance of the individual areas may vary by region; on the other 
hand, we do not wish to judge, for example, whether the health of over 
640,000 employees worldwide is more important than, for example, 
resource conservation throughout the vehicle life cycle – or vice versa. 
As we understand it, sustainable development means taking equal 
account of economic, environmental and social interests and main-
taining an appropriate balance between them.
STRATEGIC STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT 
GRi 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-46
As an automobile manufacturer with 12 brands and 120 production 
sites, offering vehicles in 153 countries, we are confronted with a 
broad spectrum of requirements, expectations and attitudes on a 
daily basis. In addition to the opportunities presented by our rela-
tionships with our stakeholders, this diversity of interests is also a 
challenge, because it can result in conflicting objectives.
Stakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations who influence 
or are influenced by our corporate decision-making processes and/
or their outcomes. At the center of our stakeholder universe are our 
customers and employees. Based on those with whom we regularly 
come into contact, we have identified 12 additional stakeholder groups 
surrounding this core, all of whom are given equal priority.

In the 2017 reporting year, our stakeholders took advantage of surveys 
and dialog events to communicate numerous expectations to the 
Volkswagen Group:
We have a strategic stakeholder management system in place to help 
us organize our many different stakeholders and their needs, and 
ensure they are included in our business decisions. To successfully 
facilitate a dialog of equals, our stakeholder management system 
must meet the following criteria:
 § Systematically recording the expectations placed on Volkswagen
 § Productively sharing the knowledge of all parties involved
 § Jointly developing solutions to problems
 § Making our decision-making processes transparent 
Successful stakeholder management requires systematic and strategic 
planning, implementation and monitoring of our activities. With this 
in mind, we restructured our stakeholder management system in the 
2017 reporting year: 
 § Planning and Governance: Our brands and divisions are responsi-
ble for maintaining direct contact with our stakeholder groups. We 
combine and manage the resulting commitments at Group level 
(sustainability management).
 § Standardization: Our stakeholder management is guided by 
the standards established at many different levels of regulation 
(policies).
 § Partnerships: At Group level, our work with selected stakeholders 
takes the form of strategic partnerships. An overview of our partner-
ships can be found in the Supplementary Information. 
 § Participation: We see our stakeholders as partners and involve 
them in our decision-making processes. In addition to the strong 
culture of co-determination at Volkswagen, the activities of our 
Group Sustainability Council should also be mentioned here.
 § Consultation: An overview of our programs and initiatives for dia-
log and interaction can be found in the Supplementary Information.  
Information received from NGOs may also prompt us to initiate 
discussions and examine opportunities for cooperation.
 § Evaluation: Each year, we collect feedback from our stakeholders 
through our Stakeholder Panel and our stakeholder surveys.  
The results of our 2017 reputation study can be found in the  
Supplementary Information.
 §  Documentation and Communication: Our Sustainability Report is 
our primary medium for documenting our activities, supplemented 
by Shift, our sustainability magazine. We regularly provide addition-
al information on current projects in press releases and newsletters 
and on social media.

In the 2017 reporting year, two examples of platforms for stakeholder 
communication were the Stakeholder Panel Dialog and the 2017  
Global Stakeholder Reputation Survey. 
We invite the members of our Stakeholder Panel to Stakeholder Dialog 
events at regular intervals. Stakeholder Panel Dialog events provide 
a format for coming together to openly and critically discuss current 
Group initiatives. In the 2017 reporting year, two of these events took 
place in our offices in Hanover (June) and Berlin (December). In each 
case, we discussed topics such as further steps in the implementation 
of our corporate strategy TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, the Volkswagen  
Group’s e-mobility initiatives, the ongoing development of our 
materiality analysis, and the scope and contents of our nonfinancial 
reporting with between 20 and 30 panel members. 
We also conducted our 2017 Global Stakeholder Reputation Survey in 
the reporting year, in collaboration with an opinion polling service 
provider. In Germany, the USA and China, a total of 300 opinion 
leaders representing research and academia, civil society, the media, 
government and financial markets were surveyed. The survey was 
designed by reference to our TOGETHER strategy and the Volkswagen 
Code of Values, as well as an analysis of material issues as required for 
our sustainability reporting. The results showed that along with prod-
uct perception, our stakeholders believe that corporate culture, values 
and integrity, as well as corporate governance, all play an important 
role in the building of trust. And in their view, this is precisely where 
further action is needed.

Supplier  
Management
As a multinational corporation, we also bear a global responsibility. 
The localization strategies at our production sites are generating ever 
more globalized and complex supplier structures. We have more than 
40,000 tier 1 suppliers worldwide, who employ more than 5 million 
people. This is why our sustainability efforts do not stop at our factory 
gates. At 41 locations in 21 countries, our procurement network  
ensures that our production facilities are supplied with production  
materials of the requisite quality, in the required quantities, at 
competitive prices. The goods and services we purchase around the 
world to manufacture our products are worth a total of €173.6 billion 
(including our Chinese joint ventures).

SUSTAINABILITY IN SUPPLIER RELATIONS 
Only by cooperating closely with our business partners can we ensure 
compliance with our sustainability standards. With this in mind, we 
rolled out our Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept in 2006. 
To identify the latest developments and long-term challenges in each 
country, we rely on the dialog which takes place between our brands 
and regions through the Sustainability Procurement Network. This 
network supports the continuous exchange of information between 
more than 20 experts.
Our Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept is based on three key 
criteria: requirements, monitoring and development. In this respect, 
we define what we expect of our suppliers in terms of sustainability, 
and then turn these expectations into requirements. We use targeted 
monitoring instruments to ensure compliance, and organize training 
initiatives to steadily raise suppliers’ awareness of sustainability 
issues.

SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS
The Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept is based on the 
“Volkswagen Group requirements regarding sustainability in its 
relationships with business partners (Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners)”. The latter embeds our expectations of our business 
partners’ conduct with respect to key environmental, social and 
compliance standards in our contractual agreements. We also call 
on our tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements down along the 
supply chain. Among other things, these requirements are based on 
the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International Chamber 
of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Development, and 
  the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization. 
 
Before we consider working with potential suppliers, we use a country 
risk analysis and other data to obtain a clearer picture of the social, en-
vironmental and human-rights risks in the areas where they operate. 
This analysis is based on third-party information and the results of 
in-house analyses. We also subject all potential new business partners 
and suppliers to an integrity check (Business Partner Check). 
During the fiscal year, prior to being awarded contracts, 137 supplier 
 locations were evaluated against sustainability criteria based on self- 
assessments. 89 of them were subjected to further on-site verification 
by an external specialist.
Our early-warning systems also screen, for example, press and internet 
coverage of relevant sustainability issues. 
Before submitting a quotation, our suppliers must confirm that they 
acknowledge our sustainability requirements; this explicit acknowl-
edgment must be repeated after 12 months have elapsed if they wish 
to submit new quotations. These requirements are an integral part of 
our contracts with all suppliers to General Procurement and with all 
suppliers of production materials. They apply to all goods and services 
purchased worldwide.

relationships with business partners can be found at:

sustainability_1/sustainability.html
CONFLICT MINERALS AND SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT 
OF RAW MATERIALS  
To us, sustainable supplier management means providing special 
protection to those groups along our supply chain who are potentially 
at high risk of human rights abuses. In this context, we regard the 
due diligence requirements for building responsible supply chains of 
minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas as an additional 
contractual requirement for our suppliers. 
In 2017, to comply with our duty of care and build responsible 
supply chains of minerals from countries affected by conflicts or 
classified as high-risk, we published – among other things – a guide-
line on sustainable raw material procurement. It can be found at: 
www.volkswagenag.com/en/sustainability/policy.html. This step also 
reflects our commitment to fulfilling the stipulations of the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals 
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. In this respect, we ex-
pect our suppliers to refrain from using any minerals sourced from 
non-compliant smelters. Minerals are considered conflict minerals if 
non-governmental armed groups are supported directly or indirectly 
through their extraction, transportation, trade, handling, processing 
or export. 
Upon request, suppliers and subcontractors must disclose to us the 
smelters or refineries from which they source the metals tin, tantalum, 
tungsten and gold. In 2017, suppliers provided us with specific infor-
mation on their supply chains that enabled us to identify 315 smelters 
of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. In cases of suspected non-compli-
ance, we also expect our suppliers to disclose the sources of materials 
that may have some connection with human rights violations such as 
child, forced or compulsory labor, as well as any other forms of mod-
ern slavery or human trafficking. This also applies to labor conditions 
in the extraction of raw materials such as cobalt and mica. 
For this purpose, we advise suppliers to use the standardized report-
ing template available from the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). 
With the help of data provided by RMI, we inform suppliers in business 
relationships with non-compliant smelters and/or refiners about alter-
native options for working with conflict-free smelters and/or refiners. 
We call on our suppliers to practice due diligence along the supply 
chain. This includes implementing measures to ensure that the min-
erals used by suppliers – in particular tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold 
and cobalt – do not directly or indirectly promote or support armed 
conflicts, and are in no way connected to human rights violations.
In 2017, as a member of the DRIVE Sustainability Working Group 
(www.drivesustainability.org), we partnered with other automotive 
manufacturers to launch an initiative on raw materials sourcing. 
This involves systematically identifying sustainability risks in the ex-
traction of raw materials and devising measures to reduce these risks.

SUPPLIER MONITORING  
In the course of the business process, our business partners are re-
quired to complete our sustainability questionnaire and to document 
their activities relating to specified areas of responsibility. The ques-
tionnaire covers the areas defined in our sustainability requirements. 
We are transferring our sustainability questionnaire over to the 
self-assessment questionnaire developed for use throughout the in-
dustry in a joint project with other automotive corporations involved 
in the DRIVE Sustainability Working Group organized by CSR Europe. 
By the end of the reporting year, over 25,000 of our suppliers had com-
pleted a sustainability self-assessment questionnaire and submitted 
it to us. This covers around 89% of our total procurement volume. We 
use the responses to these self-assessments to help identify ways to 
enhance sustainability performance, and then communicate the latter 
to our suppliers. In the last fiscal year, by taking appropriate measures 
to enhance suppliers’ sustainability performance, we were able to im-
prove the sustainability performance of more than 1,500 suppliers.

As one of our environmental requirements, we require our tier 1  
suppliers to put in place a certified environmental management  
system that complies with ISO 14001 and/or EMAS. To date, 88% of  
our tier 1 suppliers have documented such a system. In accordance 
with the EMAS and ISO 14001 environmental certification and audit-
ing procedures at our sites, contractors and suppliers who work on  
site and have an environmental impact are also subject to regular  
audits. In addition, we encourage our suppliers to put in place a  
certified occupational health and safety management system that 
complies with OHSAS 18001, SA8000 and/or AA1000. 
Where selected business partners are identified by self-assessments or 
our internal analysis system as being at increased risk of non-compli-
ance with sustainability requirements, they are – for example – audited 
by an external specialist on site. These audits cover all our sustain-
ability assessment criteria, as well as interviews with employees of the 
selected suppliers; 321 suppliers were audited in the current fiscal year.
If there is reason to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their subcontractors 
are failing to comply with our sustainability requirements, we ask the 
party concerned for a written statement using a standardized report 
(6D Report). Based on the six points we specify in the report, our busi-
ness partners can describe the situation and any remedial measures. If 
the answers prove unsatisfactory, we take further steps, such as exam-
ining documentation or visiting the supplier’s premises. 
What we refer to as “ad-hoc cases” represent a significant proportion 
of our supplier assessment activity. These refer to the sudden dis-
covery of instances where a supplier is suspected of non-compliance 
with our sustainability requirements. This may happen, for example, 
during an on-site audit.
Where such an ad-hoc or suspected case of non-compliance occurs, 
the ad-hoc expert team from the relevant brand or region coordinates 
the implementation of a series of remedial measures, as appropriate. 
In such cases, the team receives support from the corporate ad-hoc 
expert team in Wolfsburg.
In 2017, for example, we worked with selected suppliers to identify 
challenges involved in complying with sustainability requirements 
related to their management of subcontractors. Due to the complexity 
of the supply chains involved, we will continue to work on these issues 
with our suppliers in 2018.
Apart from sustainability issues, last year, for example, we identified 
non-conformances in the management of occupational health and 
safety during a third-party audit. Together with the supplier and the 
local ad-hoc expert team, we developed a plan of action. As part of 
implementing the action plan, the supplier’s plant was inspected and 
the supplier was given practical help by the ad-hoc team. All remedial 
measures were completed by the end of 2017.

In addition to 62 ad-hoc cases, our Internal Audit function uncov-

measures being agreed with suppliers. These cases involved supplier 
conduct that failed to comply with regulatory or contractual require-
ments, which was either reported by individuals or discovered in the 
course of regular program audits.
In addition, both employees and third parties can address possible 
cases of non-compliance via the Volkswagen Group’s employee rep-
resentation bodies or trade union associations, as well as through the 
Volkswagen Group’s ombudsman system.
As a result of these audits and the above-mentioned ad-hoc cases,

SUPPLIER TRAINING 
To anchor the Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept more 
firmly throughout the Group, we are making employees more aware 
of sustainability issues along the supply chain and providing them 
with appropriate training. The concept is an established part of the 
skills profile for all Procurement employees. In 2017, more than 
2,000 procurement staff worldwide were given training in this area. 
In addition, buyers of components associated with higher sustain-
ability risks were given an intensive training program in a separate 
format.
To facilitate ongoing supplier development, we make an e-learning 
module on sustainability available to all suppliers as part of our 
business relationship, as well as to Volkswagen Group procurement 
staff, in all languages of the countries which have been defined as 
compliance risks. By the end of the reporting year, 29,000 suppliers 
– representing 80% of our procurement volume – had completed the 
e-learning module.

personnel employed by some 360 of our suppliers were given training 
on sustainability issues at these events. 
In 2015, as part of our efforts to work with our suppliers to minimize 
the negative environmental impacts of our vehicles, we also joined the 
CDP Supply Chain Program, which documents greenhouse gas emis-
sions along the entire value chain.

Integrity
Because we value a neutral outside perspective, in 2016 we also 
appointed a Sustainability Council of experts in research, academia, 
science and politics. With their independent expertise and recom-
mendations, they support our efforts to fulfill our social responsibili-
ties, promote integrity, foster our stakeholder dialog, and advance the 
steady, sustainable development of our Company. 
Furthermore, the remuneration of the Group Board of Management is 
geared to the Company’s long-term results. We have overhauled our re-
muneration system to balance the interests of our different stakeholder 
groups, ensuring that it:
 § aligns with established market practice and regulatory requirements
 § is geared to capital markets and reflects personnel-related transfor-
mation objectives
 § incorporates the strategic goals of our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025
 § sets ambitious goals for sustainable corporate growth
 § incorporates an extended long-term perspective
 § represents a key element of the Group’s strategic realignment
 § does not reflect any past events, hence focuses entirely on the future
 § is based on a transparent target-compensation approach
 § includes a total remuneration cap that is markedly lower than the 
caps for individual remuneration components
 § is based on clear remuneration policy guidelines
 § is transparent and easy to understand
further information on the work of the sustainability council can be found  
in our sustainability magazine shift 2017 at:  
https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/sustainability/shift.html
The massive loss of trust that followed the diesel issue in particular 
made it clear that our primary aim must be to become a role model 
for integrity. This intention represents one of the key objectives of our 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025. In our integrity program, we are pursuing 
a three-dimensional approach that unites the dimensions of corporate 
culture, integrity and compliance:

The integrity management function is responsible for planning,

clarify and intensify our collective awareness of integrity, as well as 
reinforcing a shared culture of integrity within the Company. On  
1 January 2016, we also created the Group Board of Management  
position for Integrity and Legal Affairs.

INTEGRITY PROGRAM
Our goal is to enhance the culture of integrity in the Group and create 
a collective awareness of integrity. To this end, in 2016 we launched 
an integrity program that includes all employees and is based on six 
action areas:
1.  Dialog & communication: We regularly distributed information on 
the concept of integrity and its importance, and on the develop-
ment of the integrity program. We also set up an integrity mailbox 
to facilitate direct communication between our employees and the 
integrity management function. In addition, we held a live chat on 
our internal social network to encourage discussion.
2.  Sounding Board program: This program aims to improve dialog 
between the integrity management function and the workforce. 
This aim is facilitated by our Integrity Ambassadors – voluntary 
supporters drawn from our management and staff. 
3.  Executive program: The special responsibility of members of man-
agement to serve as role models for integrity was emphasized in a 
letter signed by the entire Group Board of Management. 7,300 man-
agers, from group leaders to Board-level executives, participated in 
integrity training in the form of a mandatory web-based training 
course for all managers, as well as a mandatory four-day confer-
ence. We also provided managers with tools for communicating 
topics such as integrity, culture and compliance to the workforce.

4.  Processes & tools: We continuously assess ways of integrating our 
principles of integrity into our key management functions, such 
as personnel processes. For instance, information on integrity is 
already a core element of our onboarding package for all newly 
hired employees, and in 2018, our web-based training course will 
become mandatory for all non-managerial employees. 
5.  Monitoring & reporting: Regular monitoring helps us to fine-
tune and readjust our integrity program and to underscore the 
relevance of integrity as a topic. This includes the evaluation of 
feedback received from our Integrity Ambassadors, employees and 
managers, as well as reports in internal media and external publi-
cations. We are currently developing strategic KPIs, in some cases 
in consultation with external specialists.
6.  Internationalization: Following the pilot phase at our Wolfsburg 
site, we are planning to expand the integrity program to include 
all brands, companies and regions. Employees responsible for gov-
ernance, risk management and compliance will play an important 
role in this process.

In the long term, we can only succeed as a Company if we act with 
integrity, respect statutory provisions worldwide and stand by our 
voluntary undertakings and ethical principles, even when this is the 
harder choice. Compliance must be second nature to all employees 
of our Group.
The principles set down in the Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct, 
which were completely reworked in the reporting year, are of essential 
importance to our employees and have been communicated through-
out the Group. The responsibility of each and every employee to 
comply with rules and regulations is given special emphasis in the 
new Code of Conduct. We have included real-world examples under 
each topic and improved the readability of the text with the aim of 
making it relevant and useful to all employees. The Volkswagen Group 
Code of Conduct was signed by every member of the Group Board of 
Management. 
 
the Volkswagen Group’s complete code of conduct can be found at: 
https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/nachhaltigkeit/documents/ 
policy-intern/code_of_conduct_2017_Vw_Group_english.pdf
 
Since 2016, the Board of Management’s Integrity and Legal Affairs 
function has been responsible for compliance. A new Group Chief 
Compliance Officer has been in place since April 1, 2017. In the report-
ing year, new structures were created within the compliance organi-
zation and its staff expanded. In addition to centers of competence 
at Group level, the structure includes Divisional Compliance Officers 
and a Regional Compliance Office. The Group Chief Compliance Officer 
reports directly to the Board Member for Integrity and Legal Affairs. 
The compliance organization is closely interconnected by various 
arrangements, including regular conferences and teleconferences. 
In addition, we have established the Volkswagen Group Compliance 
Committee under the direction of the Board Member for Integrity 
and Legal Affairs. The committee addresses monitoring, as well as the 
long-term, coordinated and continuing development of responses to 
fundamental compliance-related issues within the Volkswagen Group. 
The Group Compliance Committee is charged with the evaluation, im-
plementation, coordination and documentation of any adjustments 
that may be required to structures and processes across all divisions 
and Group companies.
The Compliance department has positioned itself to meet fu-
ture challenges. With the aim of better fulfilling this mission and 
drawing on lessons learned from past incidents, our whistleblower 
system, which was put in place in 2006, was improved and partially 
restructured in 2017; further optimization of the processes was 
completed on November 1, 2017. Among other initiatives, a central 
Investigation Office was set up in the Compliance department at the 
beginning of the year. It is responsible for coordinating the Volk-
swagen Group’s whistleblower system and for processing tip-offs 
relating to Volkswagen AG or the Group, including all brands and 
companies.
In addition, AUDI AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG and Volkswagen 
Truck & Bus GmbH are setting up individual brand investigation 
offices for themselves and their subsidiaries. 
Reports of compliance violations can be submitted in all of the 
Group’s main languages and are handled confidentially. The people 
providing the information need not fear being punished by the 
Company for doing so. Whistleblowers always decide for themselves 
whether or not they wish to remain anonymous.
Thus in 2017, an additional, specially protected online reporting 
channel was set up to allow violations to be reported anonymously 
to the Investigation Office. As part of the ongoing development 
of the whistleblower system, employees of Volkswagen AG and 
other Group companies were made more aware of the system for 
reporting non-compliances and the system itself was restructured – 
among other things, to ensure that there was a uniform procedure 
in place across the Group. In 2017, 1,489 reports were registered 
across the Group via the whistleblower system, of which 841 were 
substantiated. In the case of all substantiated reports, investigations 
were or are being carried out, and any misconduct uncovered was or 
is being appropriately punished.
The whistleblower system focuses on the disclosure of suspected 
serious violations as defined in our guideline. We define serious vio-
lations as cases that could cause substantial harm to the interests of 
the Volkswagen Group or one of its Group companies – in particular, 
financial harm or damage to reputation. This includes, for example, 
breaches of criminal laws, violations of U.S. environmental regula-
tions, and especially human rights violations. Infringements of our 
Code of Conduct or other internal regulations may also constitute 
serious procedural violations as defined in our whistleblower guide-
line.

Experienced lawyers and defense attorneys work in the whistleblow-
er system. They follow up the tip-offs, taking both incriminating 
and exonerating factors into account. A full investigation is only 
launched after very careful examination of each report, and only if 
there is concrete evidence of a serious breach of the rules. The per-
sons implicated are presumed innocent until proof of misconduct 
has been established. They are treated fairly, allowed to respond as 
soon as possible, informed of the outcome of the investigation, and 
vindicated if they have been wrongly accused. The process provides 
comprehensive protections both for the whistleblower and for the 
person accused.
Detailed information on the Volkswagen Group’s whistleblower system can be 
found in the Group Management Report in our Annual Report 2017.
 
PREVENTION THROUGH INFORMATION
To raise awareness of the importance of compliance, all new employ-
ment contracts between Volkswagen AG and management staff on 
the one hand, and employees covered by collective agreements on the 
other, include references to the Code of Conduct plus the obligation to 
comply with it. As part of the hiring process, all new employees receive 
a copy of the Code of Conduct, and participation in training courses on 
the Code of Conduct is mandatory for all employees under permanent 
contract to Volkswagen AG.
We are aware that the risk of individual misconduct can never be com-
pletely eliminated. To raise employee awareness of compliance-relat-
ed issues, we use both traditional communication channels such as 
employee newsletters, magazines and information stands (at works 
meetings, for example), and also electronic media such as intranet 
portals and Group Connect. 
In 2017, around 219,549 employees throughout the Group were given 
various forms of compliance training. Mandatory compliance training 
courses are held for specific target groups, following a risk-based 
approach. In addition to traditional lectures and online e-learning 
programs, case studies, role-play and other interactive formats are also 
used in employee and management training courses.
Employees are able to obtain advice on compliance issues by writing 
to dedicated e-mail addresses. Advice provided to employees of the 
Volkswagen brand focused in particular on the Code of Conduct and 
corruption prevention. Employees of Volkswagen AG are able to obtain 
personal advice about compliance issues by contacting the compliance 
organization via a dedicated e-mail address. 
The Volkswagen Integrity, Culture and Compliance Convention also 
took place in the reporting year. A total of more than 7,300 executives, 
managers and Works Council members from Volkswagen AG, Volkswa-
gen Sachsen and Volkswagen Osnabrück attended the event. 
The aim of the convention was to continue driving forward the change 
process at Volkswagen. Executives from different levels of the man-
agement hierarchy explored topics such as integrity, cultural change 
and compliance in their everyday work, as well as their responsibility 
to lead by example. Participants prepared for the event by using an 
e-learning program to familiarize themselves with the issues.

Risk Management
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with our 
operating activities and taking a forward-thinking approach to manag-
ing them is crucial to our Company’s long-term success. A foresighted 
risk management process and effective internal control systems are 
therefore vitally important to us. Not only do we set high internal stan-
dards, we also insist that all our suppliers along our entire value chain 
comply with these standards.
Our risk management and internal control system (RMS/ICS) defines 
the primary principles and elements of our Group, forming the basis 
for the appropriate and effective management and control of material 
risks. This includes not only risks with impacts limited purely to the 
Volkswagen Group, but also risks that could have impacts on the envi-
ronment and society.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  
CONTROL SYSTEM (RMS/ICS)
Our comprehensive RMS/ICS helps us deal with risks in a responsible 
manner. The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/
ICS is based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Orga-
nizations of the Treadway Commission). In the reporting year, we 
continued to pursue a risk management approach that combines 
aspects of the internal control system with aspects of the compliance 
management system. 
Our organizational guideline on risk management requires all 
divisions and business units to put a RMS/ICS in place. The exact 
operational form of the RMS/ICS is up to the risk managers in the 
individual divisions and business units. The Group Risk Management 
function supports the divisions by providing necessary training and 
participating in conceptual development.
The Board of Management receives ad-hoc, quarterly and annual risk 
reports. 
In 2017, we continued to reinforce our internal control system in 
the area of product compliance. This includes what are known as the 
Golden Rules. 
Any assessment of the probability and scope of future events or 
developments is, by its nature, subject to uncertainty. We are therefore 
aware that even the best RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and 
even the best ICS can never completely prevent irregular or non-com-
pliant actions.
Another key element of our RMS/ICS is the three lines of defense 
model – a basic element required, among others, by the European 
Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). In line with 
this model, our RMS/ICS has three lines of defense that are designed 
to protect us from the occurrence of material risks. 
A detailed overview of our risk management and internal control system can  
be found in the Report on Risks and opportunities in our Annual Report 2017 on 
page 165–168.

> Risks from the Diesel issue
VOLKSWAGEN GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

stRAteGy AND MANAGeMeNt  |  Risk MANAGeMeNt
 § The first line of defense is formed by the operational risk manage-
ment and internal control systems of the individual Group divi-
sions and companies. The RMS/ICS is an integral part of our Group’s 
organizational structures and processes. 
 § The second line of defense is the Group Risk Management function, 
which sets standards for the RMS/ICS and coordinates the quarterly 
risk survey and annual governance, risk and compliance (GRC) con-
trol process. It reports to the Group Board of Management on any 
material risks, which are also defined in terms of quantitative and 
qualitative assessment criteria and given probability ratings.
 § The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which carries out 
regular checks on the structure and implementation of the RMS as 
part of its independent audit activities.
 
A detailed overview of our risk management and internal control sys-
tem can be found in our 2017 Annual Report, in the Group Manage-
ment Report’s Report on Risks and Opportunities. 
The diesel issue both causes intrinsic risks for the Volkswagen Group 
and has an impact on existing risks. 
Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general envi-
ronmental risks and climate-change risks.
These include risks that could result from differing CO₂ and emissions 
regulations. Extreme weather situations, storms or floods can cause 
failures of information and communication technology, supplier fail-
ures resulting in production stoppages, or general production down-
time at one or more of our production facilities around the world. Our 
evaluation of the overall risk situation includes the potential impacts 
of natural disasters and resource shortages. Our risk assessment takes 
the form of a net analysis, i.e. taking account of any countermeasures 
initiated to minimize the risk.
Our Group risk management processes also take account of the risks 
associated with six nonfinancial aspects:
 § Environmental matters
 § Labor matters
 § Social matters
 § Customer matters
 § Respect for human rights
  § Combating corruption and graft
The Report on Risks and Opportunities in the Management Report 
provides an overview of the risks judged by the Volkswagen Group  
to be of material significance, including risks related to the six non-
financial aspects subject to mandatory reporting. It also includes risks 
arising from the diesel issue under the nonfinancial aspects of envi-
ronmental matters (see link below). Otherwise no other high-proba-
bility risks with potentially severe negative impacts on nonfinancial 
aspects were identified in fiscal year 2017.

Climate change, resource availability and urbanization are among the major  global 
challenges facing us in the Volkswagen Group. Our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 
aims to make a significant contribution to ensuring that mobility has less impact 
on the environment. We also want to help attain the United Nations Sustainable 
 Development Goals (SDGs). Our aim is to become a role model for environmental 
protection. We believe the transformation of our core business is the right  
way to meet these objectives.  
Products and 
Production
VOLKSWAGEN GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

Products and Production  |  ManageMent aPProach –  Products and Production
Our Group has a long tradition of commitment to environmental 
protection. It is firmly embedded in our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 
as one of our four corporate objectives. As one of the world’s leading 
providers of sustainable mobility, we also want to become an Environ­
mental Role Model. We are working toward this long­term goal by 
taking responsibility for the environment – day in, day out. 
With this in mind, we have defined the following targets:
 § To continuously improve our carbon footprint
 § To continuously reduce our pollutant emissions
  § To continuously reduce our resource consumption
For us, effective environmental protection means complexity and 
consistency in equal measure. This is why we are focusing on the 
 development of environmentally friendly products by ensuring that 
our powertrain and fuel strategy is fundamentally sustainable. Road­
map E, which we adopted in 2017 as the centerpiece of our electrifi­
cation drive, will be supported by innovative solutions for modern 
combustion engines and alternative drive systems. Research into 
sustainable mobility solutions and digitized business models is the 
final element in our strategic realignment. 
We look at the entire life cycle from product development through 
production, from logistics – including the supply chain – through 
the use phase, right through to recycling (LifeCycle Thinking). At 
every stage, we take a holistic approach to analyzing environmentally 
relevant factors such as energy and CO₂ emissions, material manage­
ment and recycling concepts, water management, recycling solutions, 
pollutants and nature conservation, in order to meet our ambitious 
decarbonization, pollutant reduction and resource conservation 
targets. We ensure that our progress toward meeting these targets is 
visible by participating in ratings and rankings.
We have set ourselves the goal of becoming one of the world’s leading 
providers of sustainable mobility. Consequently, alongside traditional 
environmental management, we are making the quality assurance 
and safety of our products our top priority. This is the only way we 
can guarantee that our products meet the very highest standards of 
vehicle and transport safety.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND  
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Group Board of Management is the highest internal decision­ 
making authority on environmental matters; it also functions as 
the Group’s Sustainability Board. The Group­wide management of 
 environmental protection is the responsibility of the Corporate 
 Environment and Energy Steering Committee, with the support of 
numerous specialist bodies.
The Corporate Environment and Energy Steering Committee coordi­
nates our brands and companies, and provides regular progress 
reports to the Board of Management.
All environmental protection activities in our Group are centered on 
our global principles. We continue to steadily expand and improve 
on these principles. The following principles are binding for all Group 
brands:
 § Group Environmental Policy 
 § Group Environmental Principles Locations/Production 
 § Group Environmental Principles Product 
  § Mission Statement on Biodiversity 
All responsible parties within the Group, working for our brands and 
at our locations, are required to comply with these environmental 
principles. The environmental policies and targets of our various 
brands are also derived from these principles. 
Environmental Officers from every part of the Group regularly meet 
at the Group Environmental Conference (G.E.C.), seeking to optimize 
our eco­friendly alignment along the entire value chain. 
Environmental protection is teamwork. This is why we involve em­
ployees across the whole Group in our efforts to jointly achieve the 
Group’s environmental goals. One of the building blocks we use for 
this purpose is the “Works Agreement on Environmental Protection”, 
which has been in place at Volkswagen AG factories (including the 
Technical Development department in Wolfsburg) since 1995 and was 
most recently updated in 2013. In support of the production process, 
the Volkswagen brand has appointed 318 ambassadors, including 
196 Environmental Ambassadors (SfU) and 122 Energy Experts (SfE). 
As at the end of 2017, 100 of our 120 production sites, as well as the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s Technical Development depart­
ment, held a valid ISO 14001 or EMAS certificate. This equates to 99% 
of our workforce.
Management Approach –

Products and Production  |  ManageMent aPProach –  Products and Production
RESOURCE CONSERVATION THROUGHOUT LIFE CYCLE
Our vision of forward­thinking, environmentally minded mobility 
spans every stage in the value chain. A comprehensive environmental 
assessment must consider all the environmental impacts of a  vehicle 
over its full life cycle, from the manufacturing process – including 
resource extraction, production of materials, supplier  processes and 
our own in­house production at all locations – through the use phase 
– including driving emissions, fuel preparation and supply – through 
to the ultimate recycling of the vehicle at the end of its life cycle.
The Group Environmental Conference held in September 2017 posi­
tioned “LifeCycle Thinking” as one of the key elements in our future 
business activities. 
Improving each vehicle’s environmental performance over its full life 
cycle is one of the environmental objectives of the Technical Develop­
ment function of our Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles brands. To meet this goal, we prepare detailed 
life cycle assessments (LCAs) for new vehicles, powertrains, compo­
nents and materials. One of the outcomes of these activities was the 
creation of our in­house software package LEAD (Life Cycle Environ­
mental Assessment Database). The system supports the Group­wide 
sharing of harmonized data that guarantees the use of standardized 
routines for calculating environmental footprints. 
Further information on sustainability standards as value creators  
for our brands can be found at: 
– Audi | aluminium stewardship initiative 
In addition, 44 production sites have had their energy management 
systems certified under the ISO 50001 standard. Since 2009, the 
“ Integration of Environmental Factors into the Volkswagen Brand’s 
Product Development” model used in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand’s Technical Development department has also been certified 
to ISO/TR 14062.
In order to devise and implement savings initiatives at Group loca­
tions, the Environment Task Force analyzes production processes 
and workshop infrastructure. This optimization team from Corporate 
 Environmental Research investigates and evaluates resource and 
 energy flows in production, together with the resulting environ­
mental impacts. Based on experience gathered from more than 
30 analyses, the team is now able to systematically strengthen and 
drive forward the sharing of initiatives. With the Environment Task 
Force’s support, we were able to transfer these initiatives to South 
America, North America and China. Existing ideas – as well as many 
newly  developed ones – were evaluated in terms of their local and 
climate­specific impacts and implemented wherever possible.
We use the “Massnahmen@web” IT system to record and catalog 
 environmental measures and make them available for Group­wide­
sharing of best practices. In the reporting period, some 1,600 imple­
mented initiatives relating to energy and the environment were 
documented in this system, all serving to improve our passenger car 
and light commercial vehicle infrastructure and production processes. 
As well as being worthwhile from an environmental viewpoint, these 
activities also make financial sense, resulting in annual savings of 
more than €37 million.

Products and Production  |  ManageMent aPProach –  Products and Production
We lay the foundations for maximizing the fuel economy and 
resource efficiency of our vehicles during the product development 
process.
In 2017, we further extended our innovation and technology leader­
ship by investing in new models, eco­friendly drive technologies and 
enhanced production processes. At the same time, we sought to make 
our cross­brand innovation management even more efficient, and to 
improve the interaction between our brands’ development processes. 
During the 2017 fiscal year, we concentrated our research and 
develop ment activities across the Group on expanding our  product 
port folio and improving the functionality, quality, safety and environ­
mental compatibility of our products – while simultaneously reducing 
the number of platforms we use. Our Group invested €13.1 billion 
in research and development in 2017. Much of this was spent on 
 efficiency­enhancing technologies.
With respect to resource efficiency, we also evaluate life cycle improve­
ment measures in economic terms. Our Corporate Research unit is 
currently involved in two long­term research projects, examining 
what the resource­efficient factory and resource­efficient vehicle of 
the future will look like. New technologies such as electric and fuel­cell 
vehicles play a key role here – especially in terms of their resource 
requirements – as do new closed­loop recycling concepts.
To ensure a holistic approach to optimization, we also involve our 
suppliers along the entire value chain so that together, we can mini­
mize the environmental impacts of our vehicles. We became active 
members of the CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP) back in 2015. In 
2017, we once again used the SCP to survey more than 100 suppliers 
who together represent 43% of our production­related procurement 
spending (excluding services, VW Brazil, Scania and our joint ventures 
in China). Overall, the response rate in 2017 rose to 84% (2016: 83%). 
 According to our suppliers’ self­assessments, they reduced their 
overall emissions by a total of 16.5 million t of CO₂­e compared to 
the previous year (2016: 16 million t of CO₂­e). In reporting year 
2016, the CDP included Science Based Targets (SBT) in the question­
naire for the first time: 25% of the suppliers who responded have 
already set themselves SBTs or undertaken to do so. These emission 
reduction  developments within our supply chain are contributing 
to  Volkswagen’s positive evaluation under the CDP rating’s Leader­
ship index.
ACTION PLAN – PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION  
In our 2025 environmental program, two indicators record the 
 progress we are making toward attaining two strategic objectives:
 § In this context, we define the decarbonization index (DCI) as a strate­
gic indicator which we use to measure progress. It measures products’ 
CO₂ emissions along the entire value chain. It is calculated by dividing 
our CO₂ footprint by the number of vehicles produced. It thus incor­
porates both direct and indirect CO₂ emissions from the individual 
production sites (Scope 1 and 2), as well as all other CO₂ emissions 
occurring throughout the life cycle of the vehicles sold – from the 
extraction of raw materials through the use phase to the recycling 
of end­of­life vehicles (Scope 3). The DCI thus makes it possible to 
pursue milestones in a transparent, holistic way as we make our way 
toward climate­friendly mobility. We are currently defining DCI target 
values for 2025, in consultation with the Volkswagen Group brands. 
The outcome should ensure that our target values contribute to  
the two­degree target set in the Paris Agreement concluded at the  
UN Climate Conference in December 2015.
 § Environmental impact reduction production per unit (UEP) was 
defined as part of our environmental production strategy, and target 
values were specified for the Group and brands. By 2025, we intend to 
reduce production­related environmental impacts per vehicle by 45% 
compared with 2010. UEP includes the consumption of energy and 
water, emissions of CO₂ and VOCs, as well as the volume of waste. 
 
By the end of 2017, we achieved a 30.8% reduction in environmental 
impacts. The status at the end of 2017 compared with the 2010 base­
line breaks down as follows (2016 figures in brackets):
 § specific energy consumption: –17.9% (–17.1%)
 § specific CO₂ emissions: –26.1% (–19.5%)
 § specific VOC emissions: –49.4% (–40.2%)
 § specific water consumption: –17.1% (–14.3%)
 § specific waste for disposal: –43.3% (–34.7%)

The automotive industry is about to make the next quantum leap 
in innovation. We assume that by 2025, about one in every four new 
vehicles manufactured by the Group – so up to three million units 
per year, depending on market developments – could run entirely on 
battery power. Volkswagen’s Roadmap E, first presented in public at 
the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA 2017), underscores the Volkswagen 
Group’s ambition to massively accelerate the electrification of its 
entire vehicle portfolio.
The Volkswagen Group’s powertrain and fuel strategy paves the way 
for carbon­neutral, sustainable mobility – entirely in keeping with 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aim 
to boost powertrain and fuel efficiency with each new generation of 
 vehicles – whether they are driven by combustion engines, hybrid 
drives, plug­in hybrids, all­electric powertrains or, perhaps at some 
point in the future, fuel­cell systems. All our mobility concepts are 
 tailored to the requirements and customer needs of our respective 
markets. By taking this approach, we will broaden our portfolio 
of drive systems such that traditional powertrains will coexist with 
 electric mobility (e­mobility) systems in the future. Our current 
 modular matrix platforms are designed so that different drive systems 
can be deployed in various combinations and flexibly fitted on 
production lines in manufacturing facilities around the world. In the 
future, we will focus on expanding our range of electric powertrains. 
We will also be adding an electrically powered version of our modu­
lar matrix (the Modular Electrification Toolkit or MEB) to form the 
backbone of upcoming electric vehicles. The MEB offers a number 
of significant advantages, especially in terms of packaging, meaning 
the arrangement of powertrain components, auxiliary systems and 
interior features.

ROADMAP E
With Roadmap E as a core element of our TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, 
we are launching the largest electrification drive in the automotive 
industry. By 2025, we want to become a world leader in e­mobility. 
To do so, we will make more than 80 new, electric models available 
for purchase to our customers around the world, including some 
50 all­electric vehicles and 30 plug­in hybrids. We are assuming that 
by 2025, one in every four new vehicles manufactured by our Group 
around the world will run on all­electric powertrains. Depending on 
how the market develops, this could be as many as 3 million electric 
vehicles per year. In subsequent years, this figure would then increase 
in leaps and bounds. 
By 2030, we intend to electrify our entire model range. By this deadline 
at the latest, there will be at least one electrically powered version of 
each of the 300 or so models manufactured by the Group, across all 
brands and markets. This makes us the first major mobility company 
to commit to a specific deadline for the full electrification of its fleet. 
Roadmap E anticipates that we shall make more than €20 billion 
available for direct investments in the industrialization of e­mobility 
by 2030 – including investment in vehicles based on newly developed 
electric platforms with ranges of up to 600 km (375 miles). 
Just to equip our own e­vehicle fleet, we will need a battery capacity 
in excess of 150 GWh per year by 2025. This corresponds to the annual 
battery cell manufacturing capacity of at least four “Gigafactories”. 
To make this possible, we have put one of the largest procurement 
volumes in the history of the industry out to tender: more than 
€50 billion.
Further information on e-mobility can be found in the  
sustainability sections of our brands:  
– Audi | e-tron   
– Porsche | ionity  
– Volkswagen | i.d. Family 
– Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles | e-crafter  
– MAN | etrucks 
 
At the moment, we are using lithium­ion cells for our all­electric and 
plug­in hybrid vehicles; we assemble these cells into battery systems. 
We are currently researching various types of batteries based on 
solid electrolytes, which have a higher energy density and also meet 
stricter safety standards. We are investigating ways of industrializing 
these technologies.
With the announcement of our accelerated electrification drive, we 
are simultaneously advocating an orderly systemic transition, with 
the modern combustion engine acting as an indispensable bridge to 
an emission­free future.

Products and Production  |  PoWertrain and  FueL strategy
We want to make sustainable, affordable mobility possible for the 
majority. To do so, we will continue to offer and improve our entire 
range of powertrains – from conventional to 100% electric. Even as 
we prepare for carbon­neutral, sustainable mobility, we will still need 
the combustion engine. Selected models like the Volkswagen up! 
with gasoline particulate filters already meet the stringent Euro 6 AG 
exhaust emissions standard, which will not become binding for all 
newly registered vehicles until September 2018. This year, we have 
already started the series production of an exceptionally fuel­efficient 
powertrain for our latest BlueMotion models, in the form of the 96 kW 
1.5 TSI evo. Thanks to our new “sailing” mode – whereby the engine 
is switched off while the vehicle is coasting – and other technical 
inno vations, the 1.5 TSI evo can achieve outstanding fuel efficiency 
of as little as 1.0 l/100 km in real­world conditions, depending on the 
customer’s driving style. 
Today, every new diesel built by our Group is fitted with an SCR 
 catalytic converter as standard, and we equip new gasoline engines 
with soot particulate filters across the board. 
We feel it is more important than ever for us to rigorously pursue 
our modular approach. So that we can offer a broad product portfolio 
as economically as possible, we are reducing the variety of individual 
modules. In the case of our conventional combustion engines, for 
 example, we will cut the number of variants within the Group by 
more than one third over the long term. 
As vehicles become increasingly electrified, CO₂ emissions in the prod­
uct life cycle are steadily shifting back toward the production phase; 
that is to say, the production of electric vehicles results in significantly 
higher CO₂ emissions than does the production of conventional vehi­
cles, due in particular to battery production.
During the use phase, however, the tables are turned in favor of 
electric vehicles. If we consider both the CO₂ emissions resulting from 
the production of fuel or generation of electricity during a vehicle’s 
service life (approx. 200,000 km or 125,000 miles), as well as the CO₂ 
emissions produced by the actual combustion of fuel (in conventional 
vehicles), electric vehicles show a decided advantage. This advantage 
is so great that despite higher CO₂ emissions during the production 
phase, electric vehicles have a better carbon footprint over their entire 
life cycle than conventionally powered vehicles. This applies almost 
regardless of the electricity mix used by the electric vehicles (with the 
exception of heavily coal­dependent electricity mixes as found in e.g. 
China or Poland).

ALTERNATIVE FUELS  
Decarbonization begins with the type of fuel used. We are already in a 
position to use so­called “reduced­carbon” fuels across all our brands. 
The practical suitability of these fuels for use in combustion engines 
has already been comprehensively demonstrated, and in  certain fields 
their use is already regarded as state of the art. They make it  possible 
to achieve almost carbon­neutral long­distance  mobility while 
simultaneously reducing other exhaust emissions (such as NOX and 
particulate emissions). Reduced­carbon fuels include biofuels (spe­
cifically, second­generation biofuels) and synthetic fuels (sometimes 
known as e­fuels) manufactured using hydrogen electrolysis powered 
by electricity from renewable sources.
By using compressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation purposes, 
that is, using methane as a fuel, we offer our customers an immediately 
available and affordable drive technology that supports sustainable 
mobility based on the combustion engine. With a broad pallet of 
CNG­powered models in the passenger car and commercial vehicle 
sectors, we are a market­influencing technology leader in this field. 
Just by using the fossil natural gas (methane) already available in the 
global gas network, we could cut CO₂ emissions by up to 25% com­
pared with today’s gasoline engines – while at the same time signifi­
cantly reducing exhaust­gas emissions. And over the next few years, 
the use of biogas or e­gas (synthetic gas produced using electricity 
from renewable sources) could make CNG mobility almost entirely 
carbon­neutral.
A number of projects within the Volkswagen Group and among our 
brands, such as the Audi “Power­to­Gas” project (a power­to­gas plant 
in Werlte) and the SEAT “SMART Green Gas” (waste­to­gas) project are 
producing reduced­carbon fuels (biofuels, e­fuels) and renewable gas 
(biogas, e­gas).
Our Group is also exploring significant synergies with e­mobility 
through “sector coupling”, meaning the joint use of energy sources in 
the power generation, heat and mobility sectors. 
Further information on our brands’ reduced-carbon fuels  
can be found at: 
– Audi | e-fuels strategy  
– SEAT | smart green gas 
– Scania | hybrid technology 
 
For heavy commercial vehicles like trucks and buses in particular, 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an economical and clean alternative, 
because its high energy density is ideal for long­distance applications.
However, in order for natural gas to become a widely usable energy 
source, better infrastructural conditions are needed. For example, 
natural­gas filling station networks are only sufficiently developed in 
a few countries. 
Further information on our brands’ alternative powertrain concepts  
can be found at: 
– Audi | e-gas system offer  
– Scania | alternative fuels  
– MAN | innovative transport and energy solutions  
– Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles | cng powertrain 
Under Audi’s leadership, we are also investigating hydrogen (H₂) as an 
energy source. We have been working on fuel­cell technology – used 
to transform H₂ into electrical energy in the vehicle – for more than 
15 years. While operating our test fleets, we have gathered extensive 
practical experience of suitable powertrains. One of the key factors 
required for H₂ to succeed is a suitable refueling infrastructure. Based 
on what we know at present, H₂ will not be widely available as a fuel 
in the medium term. For this to be possible, hydrogen filling stations 
and plants for producing hydrogen as a renewable energy source must 
first be developed. For this reason, we are actively involved in the H₂ 
Mobility project, the aim of which is the systematic development of an 
H₂ infrastructure in Germany. We will make the decision on whether 
to use H₂ in production vehicles on the basis of market demand and 
infrastructure.

We welcome the ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate 
change, which aims to limit global warming to less than 2°C above 
pre­industrial levels. Referring to international climate agreements, 
our CEO Matthias Müller is calling upon the automotive industry to 
ensure that all fleet CO₂ emissions “are steadily reduced to zero by 
2050.”  
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CO₂ EMISSIONS
To reduce energy consumption and CO₂ emissions across the Group, 
we are relying on a combination of measures, including improved en­
ergy efficiency, the use of gas instead of coal for power generation, and 
the procurement of electricity from renewable sources. We now meet 
around 37% of our global electricity requirements from renewables.
Our most effective lever for reducing our global carbon footprint is 
to optimize CO₂ emissions from our vehicle fleet. After all, according 
to the Scope 3 GHG Inventory, 74% of all CO₂ emissions are produced 
during the use phase.
And this does not take into account direct CO₂ emissions from our 
company cars. We are currently working on standardizing the meth­
ods used to record emissions from our company­car fleet worldwide. 
The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (excluding 
Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 122 g CO₂/km* over 
the reporting period – well below the European limit of 130 g CO₂/
km applied in 2017. The slight increase compared with the previous 
year is mainly due to the new measurement procedures that must be 
used, and the decline in the proportion of diesel­vehicle deliveries. As 
small­volume manufacturers, the Lamborghini and Bentley brands 
each have an independent fleet for the purposes of the European CO₂ 
legislation; Bentley complied with its individual target, Lamborghini 
was slightly above its target. 
CO₂ emissions from the Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet 
outside the EU break down as follows:
In the USA, the fleet emissions figure is 163.1 g CO₂/km (Audi/VW 
calendar year; not including Volkswagen of America (VWoA)), in 
China 149.6 g CO₂/km (Volkswagen Group (Import) Co. Ltd. (VGIC) + 
Shanghai Volkswagen (SVW) + First Automotive Works (FAW­VW)), and 
in Brazil 129 g CO₂/km.

As a result of a continuous rise in production volumes, our overall 
energy consumption has increased since 2010. At the same time, 
we have been able to reduce our energy consumption per vehicle by 
–17.9% since 2010, from 2,519 kWh to 2,069 kWh. Over the past year, 
we have reduced energy consumption per vehicle by –1.0% compared 
with the previous year.
Our overall consumption of electrical energy has risen in comparison 
with 2010, even though we have taken various efficiency­enhancing 
measures to successfully reduce our electricity consumption per 
vehicle since 2010.
Heat consumption is subdivided into space heating demand for 
production and non­production areas in manufacturing facilities, and 
heating demand for technical processes. Since space heating accounts 
for the greater proportion of the total heating demand, weather con­
ditions have a major impact on trends in overall heating demand. Our 
absolute heat consumption has risen slightly since 2010.

Increased production volumes and downstream procedures for the 
thermal afterburning of VOC emissions from paint shops resulted in 
higher consumption of gases used to fuel manufacturing processes.

Since 2011, VW Kraftwerk GmbH has been investing in the ongoing 
development of renewables and the construction of highly efficient 
combined heat and power (CHP) plants driven by natural gas. Thus in 
the period to 2016, the company invested around €26 million in renew­
ables such as wind farms and photovoltaic power plants. As part of 
our fuel conversion strategy, VW Kraftwerk GmbH also invested some 
€15 million in a CHP plant in Braunschweig and some €65 million in a 
gas and steam turbine (combined­cycle) plant in Kassel. Furthermore, 
in addition to the company’s own electricity generation activities, we 
are already implementing an increasingly widespread energy pro­
gram for the Volkswagen Group’s production sites in Germany using 
carbon­neutral Volkswagen Naturstrom®. The electricity is generated 
from 100 % renewable energy sources. It is backed up by certificates 
of origin, validated for each user by the German Federal Environment 
Agency (UBA). Contractual agreements have already been signed for 
supplying Volkswagen Naturstrom® to other sites. Over the next few 
years, VW Kraftwerk GmbH will also be looking to invest in new com­
bined­cycle power plants in Wolfsburg, and in the further development 
of renewables.
As an example of such development, once we have received approval 
for the construction and operation of certified wind power plants with 
a total capacity of 12.8 MW at our MAN Salzgitter site, we are planning 
to take part in the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) tendering process in 
2018. Once our bid has been accepted under the EEG tendering pro­
cess, we can start to build the wind farm.
Despite the inclusion of new production sites (along with the associat­
ed increase in energy consumption), direct CO₂ emissions in the cars 
and light commercial vehicles category, and indeed across the Group 
as a whole, have been falling since 2010. 
Direct CO₂ emissions are associated with the combustion of fossil 
fuels, the use of which we have successfully reduced. This reduction in 
the absolute volume of emissions goes hand in hand with the decline 
in direct CO₂ emissions per vehicle since 2010.

CO₂ emissions (Scope 1 and 2) have fallen since 2010, thanks to 
improved energy efficiency and a reduced­carbon energy supply. As 
a result, we have been able to reduce CO₂ emissions per vehicle by 
–26.1% since 2010, from 1,096 kg to 810 kg of CO₂. Last year alone, 
we were able to reduce CO₂ emissions per vehicle by –8.3% compared 
with the previous year.
Volkswagen AG operates power stations and boiler plants, which gen­

tion facilities using suitable CO₂ emission factors.

We have not taken direct CO₂ emissions from company cars and 
official works vehicles into account. We are currently working on 
standardized methods for recording emissions from our company­car 
fleet around the world. Preliminary calculations for Volkswagen 
Deutschland and Audi indicate a 2.6% increase in total CO₂ emissions 
in the footprint under investigation. 
Not shown here are Group carbon offset projects equating to 6,577 t of

On the other hand, the stated CO₂ emissions do not include emissions 
produced by Volkswagen AG power plants in the course of supplying

amounted to 379,516 t of CO₂.

In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World  Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World 
Resources Institute (WRI), we report CO₂ emissions for 12 out of a 
total of 15 Scope 3 categories. Our calculations have revealed that the 
“Purchased goods and services” and “Use phase” emission categories 
account for around 92% of all Scope 3 emissions. CO₂ emissions in 
the use phase are calculated on the basis of a Group fleet value repre­
senting the global vehicle population in the four major regions (EU28, 
USA, Brazil and China). In order to provide as complete a picture as 
possible, we also collect data on emissions in this category that are 
produced during the production and transportation of fuels (“well to

In our quest to improve our environmental performance, we do not 
limit our efforts to the interiors of our production facilities, we also 
look at our Group real estate as a whole. In 2017, Volkswagen Immo­
bilien GmbH formulated a holistic sustainability model. Not only does 
the model focus on the entire life cycle of each property, including 
construction, operation and maintenance; it also examines how each 
asset is funded. By taking this holistic approach, we aim to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s strategy. We would also like to 
take a leading role in the residential real­estate sector as a sustainable 
investor in the region. In 2017, we completed a number of construc­
tion projects that complied with our own “Blue Building” sustainability 
standard and subsequently leased them in full.

EMISSIONS TRADING
32 of our Group locations take part in European emissions trading. 
For 2017, a total of 1,116,441 emissions certificates were allocated to 
the Volkswagen Group free of charge (69,977 fewer than in the previ­
ous year).
The European Commission is planning further modifications in emis­
sions trading when the fourth trading period begins (from 2021) that 
may lead to reinforcement of the system and thus to price increases in 
the certificates. In addition to the EU member states, other countries 
in which the Volkswagen Group has production sites are also consid­
ering introducing an emissions trading system. Seven corresponding 
pilot projects are running in China, for example, although they have 
not so far affected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government 
officially implemented a national emissions trading system at the end 
of 2017. Initially, the impact will only be on the energy generation 
sector; a gradual expansion is being planned.  
NEW TEST PROCEDURES FOR MEASURING EXHAUST 
EMISSIONS AND FUEL CONSUMPTION
Since 1 September 2017, new procedures have been in place for 
measuring exhaust­gas emissions (such as particulates and nitrogen 
oxides) and consumption (CO₂) by new vehicle models in the EU. On 
test benches, the new WLTP standard is replacing the old NEDC test 
cycle. The new procedure is more dynamic and should better reflect 
on­the­road driving conditions in the laboratory. A significant inno­
vation in the measurement of fuel consumption: in the future, every 
vehicle will also be assigned an individual CO₂ value. Under the NEDC 
standard, CO₂ values were arranged in families. 
The abbreviation WLTP stands for “Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty 
Vehicles Test Procedure”. The new test cycle was introduced in order to 
establish internationally standardized CO₂ emission measurements 
for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, and to provide a 
more realistic picture of levels of CO₂ emissions and fuel consumption 
for end­customers. 
The second stage of the WLTP cycle’s introductory phase is due to start 
on 1 September 2018, at which point all new vehicles will have to be 
tested using the WLTP’s fuel consumption and exhaust­gas emission 
testing methods.
In addition, under what is known as Real Driving Emissions (RDE) 
legislation, on­the­road threshold values for particulates (PN) and 
nitrogen oxides will also come into force for the first time. This means 
that for the first time, exhaust­gas emission limits will not only apply 
on the test bench, but also on the road.

Production and 
Logistics
The “Ecologically Exemplary Production” initiative is firmly anchored 
in our production strategy, which is derived from our Group strategy. 
As part of this initiative, we will be working to achieve four key objec­
tives by 2025:
 § Setting and achieving ambitious environmental targets for 
 production
 § Developing a long­term vision for environmental targets in 
 production and rolling it out across the Group
 § Improving employees’ environmental awareness and incorporating 
relevant environmental aspects into Group processes
  § Achieving top positions in prestigious environmental rankings
With this in mind, we have set ourselves the ambitious goal of 
reducing levels of the five key environmental indicators per vehicle 
manufactured – energy and water consumption, waste for disposal, 
CO₂ and VOC emissions – by 45% by 2025 (compared with the 2010 
baseline). This target applies to all the Group’s production sites and 
builds on the eco­friendly production process requirements defined 
in our Group Environmental Principles.
In addition to continuously reducing these five environmental indi­
cators, we are also actively pursuing other initiatives which aim to 
improve our material processing efficiency, recycling levels, environ­
mental protection in logistics, and nature conservation.  
 
MATERIAL INPUT AND RECYCLING
In our efforts to achieve sustainable production, the use of low­impact 
raw materials plays an important role in reducing our consumption of 
natural resources. 
To manufacture our vehicles, we need production materials com­
prised of renewable and non­renewable resources. Our efforts to 
conserve resources over the entire life cycle of our vehicles start at the 
earliest development stage. By taking this approach, we can continu­
ously reduce the environmental impacts of the materials we use by 
prioritizing renewable and secondary raw materials. 
This is why we focus on using renewable raw materials in vehicle pro­
duction: wherever possible, our Group brands use natural­fiber­based 
raw materials such as flax, cotton, wood, cellulose and hemp in floor 
insulation, trunk linings, door and side­panel trims, and hood insula­
tion. But even when using these renewable materials, we adhere to

initiative can be found at:

strict sustainability standards: in certain instances, negative envi­
ronmental impacts based on water, fertilizer, energy or land require­
ments, not to mention social factors such as competition with food 
crops, may militate against the use of renewable raw materials.
Lightweight body­shell production is a strategic development pri­
ority. In terms of functionality, quality, safety and environmental 
compatibility, we are either improving our existing products or de­
signing brand­new ones. We use hot­formed, high­strength steels in 
production models. While a lot of energy is required to manufacture 
these products, the lighter vehicle bodies make it possible to reduce 
CO₂ emissions and hence improve our products’ environmental im­
pact. We are also pursuing a composite materials approach for certain 
vehicles and platforms, using a range of different materials in one 
body shell. When developing new platforms, we also use lightweight 
materials such as aluminium. 
 
 
Another element in our sustainable use of materials is the introduc­
tion of closed­loop material cycles in our production processes. 
Instead of primary raw materials, we increasingly rely on recycled 
materials. These are obtained from production residues or end­of­
life materials – but must meet exactly the same quality standards as 
primary raw materials. 
Recycling enables us to further reduce our products’ environmental 
impact, while at the same time conserving resources. For example, 
even at the development stage of new vehicles, we pay attention to the 
recyclability of the required materials, the use of high­quality recycled 
materials and the avoidance of pollutants. This means that end­of­life 
vehicles can be 85% recycled and 95% recovered. 
Other measures that are steadily improving our vehicles’ environmen­
tal performance focus on, for example, extending the battery life of 
lithium­ion batteries and introducing closed­loop recycling of their 
materials.
The implementation of the Aluminium Closed Loop Project in 2017 
was the first time we had organized a closed loop for aluminium with 
non­Group suppliers. The project returned sheet aluminium scrap 
from our press shops directly to suppliers for subsequent reuse in 
vehicles.
To calculate the proportion of recycled materials in an entire vehicle, 
we identify the materials in all of the vehicle’s components, together 
with their recycled material content, and add them up. In order to do 
this, we depend on reliable information obtained directly from our 
suppliers, as well as data from industry­specific associations.

WATER
Conserving our planet’s freshwater reserves is one of the  pivotal 
 requirements for preserving the basic necessities of life. Water 
resources are already scarce in many parts of the world, and access 
to clean drinking water is an increasingly pressing problem for 
large  sections of the global population. During our products’ use 
phase, water consumption only plays a minor role. The supply chain 
is a  significant consumer of water, however, especially during the 
extraction or creation of raw materials. We have no direct influence 
over this upstream phase. Consequently, to reduce our water con­
sumption, we are focusing on areas which we can influence directly: 
our production plants. Our latest review indicates that 55% (around 
22  million m³) of our entire freshwater consumption is attributable 
to sites located in regions where groundwater resources are at risk. 
The water management strategy adopted by the Corporate Environ­
ment & Energy Steering Committee defines four areas of activity:  
 § ensuring safe, reliable water supply and disposal by protecting 
groundwater resources from pollutants, 
 § using water efficiently throughout the product life cycle by imple­
menting closed loops, 
 § engaging in social and environmental projects to protect water 
resources and promote public environmental awareness, 
 § enhancing transparency by supporting the CEO Water Mandate 
and the CDP Water Disclosure Project. In 2017, we were included 
on the CDP Water A­List. The list includes those companies which 
were identified over the last CDP reporting year as global leaders 
in sustainable water management. 
Our in­house White Paper defines key requirements for the vari­
ous processes in our production sequence. These requirements are 
helping us implement sustainable, water­efficient processes across the 
entire Group.

Depending on where wastewater is purified, we make a distinction 
between locations that act as so­called “indirect dischargers” by 
discharging wastewater into municipal sewers for further purification, 
and those that act as so­called “direct dischargers” by treating their 
own wastewater in­house and then discharging the purified waste­
water directly into a body of water.
The absolute demand for freshwater in our Group has risen over the 
last few years. This is due not only to the inclusion of new locations in 
our reporting system, but also to the growing numbers of passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles we are manufacturing. On the other 
hand, freshwater consumption per vehicle has steadily declined since 
2010, thanks to a raft of recycling initiatives and the introduction of 
manufacturing techniques that use minimal water. In 2017, we were 
able to reduce water consumption per vehicle to 3.76 m³ from 3.89 m³ 
in 2016.

Wastewater volumes show a similar trend to the volume of freshwater 
consumption. Differences in freshwater and wastewater volumes are 
caused by evaporation losses from cooling towers and in the manufac­
turing process. We have been able to reduce the volume of wastewater 
per car and light commercial vehicle produced by 22% since 2010, 
from 3.76 m³ to 2.92 m³ in 2017.

WASTE
Making steadily more efficient use of resources means concentrating 
on avoidance, recovery and recycling – for example by introducing 
intelligent concepts for a closed­loop economy. 
As part of our waste strategy, we aim to use materials and products 
more and more efficiently, thereby reducing the volume of waste 
per unit manufactured and recycling any unavoidable waste to high 
 standards. Specifically, this entails:  
 § Avoiding waste generation by optimizing production and ancillary 
processes and/or increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency),
 § Reducing waste volumes by localizing waste treatment at our sites,
 § Prioritizing waste recycling and reducing the amount of waste for 
disposal. 
To optimize our waste management, we are making great efforts to 
use digital waste management systems across all our divisions. Such 
systems are already used to control waste management processes in 
all German factories and some of the other European factories oper­
ated by the Volkswagen, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, 
Audi, MAN and Scania brands, and to facilitate the state­monitored 
disposal of hazardous waste in particular (Electronic Government). 
We are planning to roll out these systems in the rest of Europe and 
subsequently across regions around the world.
In 2015, we introduced waste disposal audits at many of our sites, 
in order to review our waste management and recycling processes. 
For these audits, we jointly developed a standardized procedure in 
collaboration with other vehicle manufacturers (original equipment 
manufacturers or OEMs) and major suppliers. Since then, we have 
been carrying out regular audits of locations and OEMs in Germany 
and the rest of Europe. In the regions, we have also started monitoring 
waste disposal services by introducing audits. We trained potential 
 auditors at our sites in eastern Europe, Spain and Portugal with the 
aim of setting a common benchmark for the quality standards ex­
pected of waste disposal services, carrying out quality­assured audits, 
and ensuring that the results can also be used by other OEMs and 
suppliers. 
Waste from production, logistics and workshops, as well as the 
Technical Development department, is recycled to high standards. 
For the recycling of potentially lucrative waste such as paper, plastics, 
wood or metals (described internally as recyclable waste materials), 
our  Procurement function has rolled out a Group­wide system that 
improves safety throughout the entire process.

In the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles category, rising 
production volumes since 2010 have resulted in an increase in the 
total volume of hazardous waste, while the total volume of non­ 
hazardous waste has declined. Similarly, we were able to reduce the 
volume of waste for disposal per vehicle from 15.2 kg in 2016 to 
13.2 kg in 2017. This represents a 43.3% reduction compared with 
the 2010 baseline.
Consequently, the proportion of waste for recycling – excluding 
 metallic waste – rose from around 66% in 2010 to around 81% in 2017. 
This increase in the proportion of recycled waste is also the result of 
the waste management strategy adopted within our Group, which 
aims to improve waste recycling rates.
The absolute quantity of metallic “recyclable waste materials” has also 
risen due to increased production volumes across the Group since 
the start of the reporting period in 2010. However, in 2017 we were 
able to reduce the volume per vehicle by 4% compared to 2010. Power 
stations operated by Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH inevitably produce 
power plant residues. In the last reporting year, we were able to recycle 
around 130,000 t of these residues.

VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS  
Coating processes are the main producers of VOC emissions.  Modern 
paintshops use coating and process materials containing fewer sol­
vents. During coating processes, we also take steps to collect and/or 
eliminate any solvents emitted. To do this, we usually use a procedure 
involving thermal afterburning of the exhaust air downstream of the 
actual coating process. 
Despite the increase in vehicle production since 2010 and the asso­
ciated increase in the number of coating operations, we were able to 
reduce absolute VOC emissions by 26.0%. We have also significantly 
reduced emissions per vehicle since 2010, by 49.4%.

GREEN LOGISTICS  
Logistics contributes to our Group’s eco-friendly orientation by ana-
lyzing the entire transport chain in terms of emissions. 
Our Green Logistics initiative took an approach based on what is 
known as the A-S-I-F model, originally developed by GIZ (Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH). The aim is to 
promote alternative modes of transportation, as well as sustainable, 
energy-efficient transport systems, in order to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
In brief, this provides Logistics with the following guidelines for 
 implementing specific measures: 
A – Avoid: avoid transportation wherever possible 
S –  Shift: move over to a more environmentally compatible  
mode of transport
I – Improve: use better or more modern technology 
F – Fuels: use alternative drive systems
This model was used to define universally valid internal environ-
mental prin ciples, from which we then developed strategic policies 
and guidelines. These are intended to ensure that our environmental 
requirements are implemented in our logistical processes worldwide.
An important starting point for reducing CO2 emissions is the selec-
tion of the mode of transport. One of the most efficient options in 
terms of transport capacity is maritime transport. To further improve 
the environmental sustainability of ship transport, Volkswagen Kon-
zernlogistik will put two charter ships powered by liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) into service from 2019. 
Starting in 2019, two eco-friendly vehicle transporters, powered by an 
engine developed by MAN Diesel & Turbo, will travel between Emden 
in Germany and North America.
In September 2017, we held an LNG Truck Day to dispel doubts and 
reservations regarding the new technology and actively support the 
expansion of the LNG fuel station network in Germany. Among others, 
regional freight forwarders, gas providers and representatives from 
the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure 
and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy took part. 
Furthermore, since 2014, we have gradually been adopting the Euro 5 
exhaust emissions standard as the minimum standard for all new 
contracts in Volkswagen AG’s European freight forwarding business. 
All in all the aforementioned measures show a selection of the various 
Green Logistics activities within the company and let the Volkswagen 
Group come closer to its ambitious goals for the future.

NATURE CONSERVATION  
Inevitably, industrial growth has an impact on natural resources. This 
is why we do not simply treat measures to preserve biodiversity in 
our Group as a temporary project; they have been an integral part of 
our environmental management strategy for years.
Biodiversity signifies the variety of life on our planet, encapsulating 
the multiplicity of species, genetic differences within species, and 
the diversity of ecosystems. We rely on it as the basis for our contin-
ued existence: healthy food, clean water, fertile soils and a balanced 
climate. Because of the worldwide decline of biodiversity, the United 
Nations declared the current decade to be the “UN Decade on Biodi-
versity”.
Since 2007, we have been committed to the protection of biodiversity 
at Group locations around the world. The objectives of more than 
80 projects across eight brands range from protecting water resources 
and various species through to reforestation and environmental edu-
cation. Representatives of and institutes in the respective regions are 
frequently involved, as are NGOs and scientific advisers. 
Volkswagen has been committed to protecting biodiversity since 2007 
and is a founder member of the Biodiversity in Good Company e.V. 
initiative. In our mission statement, we have pledged to support the 
protection of species across all our locations. To do so, we work closely 
together with our local suppliers. Our membership of the Biodiversity 
in Good Company e.V. initiative is temporarily on hold as a result of 
the diesel issue.
The protection of biodiversity is an integral part of our environmental 
management strategy. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
using resources as efficiently as possible, we are helping to achieve 
the objectives set down in the UN Convention on Biological  Diversity 
(CBD). To raise public awareness of the importance of protecting 
species, and to increase general knowledge on the subject, Volkswagen 
is making efforts to network with major players in business, politics, 
civil society and academia. 
To consolidate our commitment to biodiversity across the Group, 
we have, among other things, appointed a biodiversity officer and 
commissioned external assessments of the risks to water, the soil and 
biodiversity across our brands. Based on this work, we are currently 
formulating targets and methods for making our active nature con-
servation work more transparent and accountable in the future, and 
for better assessing the effectiveness of our many projects.  
 
Volkswagen FS AG is currently engaged in several projects with 
Naturschutzbund Deutschland e.V. (NABU) including, for  example, a 
peatland conservation project. In addition to supporting the  German 
Peatland Conservation Fund (13 national project areas to date), 
we also sponsor the European Union’s LIFE Peat Restore Project, 
 organized jointly by NABU with partners in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia 
and Estonia.

Product and 
Road Safety
We want to keep our customers as safe as possible on the road by 
offering them a comprehensive range of efficient, affordable and 
practical powertrain technologies combined with smart mobility 
concepts. These embrace passive and active vehicle safety systems, as 
well as climate and environmental protection. 
QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PRODUCT SAFETY  
Our customers attach the utmost importance to product safety. So we 
take a meticulous approach to quality assurance along the entire value 
chain, from procurement right through to sales.
Right at the start, when a vehicle is first being developed, we use stan­
dardized processes to exclude potential use risks. At the next stage, 
production, our product safety officers rely on lessons­learned processes 
to ensure that our products stay safe. Because the approach followed by 
our product safety officers has proved its worth, we are now gradually im­
plementing it among our suppliers, hence along our entire supply chain.
We have established quality specifications for the materials and operating 
fluids we use that focus not only on their functional properties but also 
on their longevity. These specifications provide the framework within 
which Volkswagen’s materials specialists, for example, define and verify 
components’ resistance to aggressive media.
Odors and emissions from plastic components inside the vehicle can im­
pair passengers’ wellbeing. To avoid these issues, we check the properties 
of the materials and components we use with great care. Our internal 
Group standard VW 50180 sets down our requirements for material 
characteristics. And suppliers must demonstrate that they are complying 
with these requirements by the sample prototype inspection stage at the 
very latest. Suppliers’ compliance data for selected components used in 
Group vehicles is further verified in our laboratories. In addition to check­
ing materials and components, we also evaluate odors and emissions in 
the passenger compartment when we start production of new concept 
vehicles and production vehicles.
More and more of us live in cities. Traffic noise impairs our quality of life. 
We want to reduce emissions not only inside our vehicles, but also wher­
ever the use of vehicles is increasing. For this reason, we are working to 
produce reliable forecasts of the potential impacts of future solutions on 
urban air quality, noise pollution and traffic flow (impact assessments). 
This is where models and simulations make an important contribution 
by helping us to develop the right solutions for the future – solutions that 
are more precisely tailored and optimized for their intended purposes.
But we are also going one step further. We are using a specially developed 
tool to calculate noise pollution levels in cities and further develop our 
understanding of the role of the automobile, assess interactions between 
different noise sources, and evaluate various measures for reducing noise. 
Our aim is to improve the noise situation for urban residents in general 
by entering into dialog with cities and fellow noise emitters.
Volkswagen Group companies are obliged by law to provide users of their 
products with appropriate information about the risks that may arise 
from their foreseeable misuse, and even from their intended use. Our 
Group companies fulfill this obligation by providing instruction manuals 
and, in specific instances, placing warning stickers inside the vehicle. 
Further more, since 1 December 2011, all passenger vehicles manufac­
tured in Germany must carry a weight­based efficiency label similar to 
the energy consumption labels used for household appliances. Efficiency 
ratings range from A+ (highly efficient) to G (inefficient). The label also 
informs users of fuel consumption, annual fuel costs, CO₂ emissions and 
annual tax charges under Germany’s CO₂­based vehicle tax. In the case of

SAFE VEHICLES AND ROAD SAFETY  
The ultimate aim of our Vision Zero is: zero fatalities or severe injuries 
in or due to vehicles manufactured by the Volkswagen Group. To 
 progress towards this vision, we have set ourselves the following goals:
 § avoidable accidents should not happen,
 § unavoidable accidents will be positively mitigated,
  § the severity of accidents will be minimized.
To achieve these goals, the Group’s accident researchers collect data 
from real­world traffic accidents. Their investigations include:
 § technical analyses of the vehicles involved to establish the technical 
severity of the accident,
 § medical analyses of injuries suffered by people involved in the 
accident,
 § psychological analyses of the circumstances surrounding the 
 accident.
 
We use the findings of these analyses to develop measures to protect 
people inside and outside the vehicle. These include the development 
of bodywork concepts and occupant retention systems, as well as new 
driver assistance systems capable of avoiding accidents or mitigating 
their consequences.
In best­case scenarios, the resulting active systems help to avoid 
accidents completely. Especially noteworthy are emergency braking 
systems (such as Front Assist) and lane­keeping systems (such as Lane 
Assist). Where the collision turns out to be unavoidable, a raft of pas­
sive systems ensures that the consequences of the accident for vehicle 
occupants are either obviated or mitigated. In particular, the coordi­
nated interaction of the vehicle structure with the occupant retention 
system plays a central role in our thinking.
In our efforts to make mobility safer, we contribute our expertise and 
experience to the German Road Safety Council (DVR) – of which we are 
an active member – and to major conferences on vehicle safety held 
around the world.  
The Volkswagen Group can look back on a long tradition of cultivating responsible  
relationships with our employees and our neighbors, as well as responding to the  
concerns of society as voiced by people outside the company. Through initiatives such  
as the 4-day week in the 1990s, which effectively rescued 30,000 jobs, or the creation of 
4,200 new jobs for the unemployed in 2002 as part of our Auto5000 program, we have 
repeatedly demonstrated our commitment to and equal prioritization of commercial 
competitiveness, job security and corporate social responsibility

Management Approach
Volkswagen seeks to be a responsible employer and a good corporate 
citizen. Reliability, trustworthiness and fairness are our watchwords – 
no matter whether we are talking to individual employees, negotiating 
with collective representative bodies, collaborating with regional part-
ners in local infrastructure development projects, or cooperating with 
civil society initiatives and associations. Through these endeavors to 
foster sustainability and cultivate mutual understanding, as a socially 
responsible company, Volkswagen is seeking to contribute to the reali-
zation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Our new “Empower to transform” human resources strategy, which 
the Group’s Board of Management approved in October 2016, con-
tinues this long tradition. The strategy is intended to ensure that the 
Group, our brands and our workforce are well placed to adapt to the 
ever more rapidly evolving challenges we are facing. In this era of 
digital transformation and connected mobility, the paramount goal 
of our human resources strategy is to be seen as one of the most 
attractive employers in the world. In this way, we aim to help the 
Volkswagen Group become a global leader in sustainable mobility 
on an enduringly profitable basis.
We are well aware that it takes more than just good pay, a secure job 
and appealing work to make an employer attractive. This is one of 
the reasons we are constantly expanding our social engagement 
activities – as a good “corporate citizen”, we see ourselves as a local 
driver of growth, contributing to structural development, education 
and equal opportunities wherever we operate. Accordingly, support 
for social, cultural and community projects is a core element of our 
strategy at all 120 of the Group’s production sites.
HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY –  
“EMPOWER TO TRANSFORM” 
At the time of launching the Group’s TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 pro-
gram in 2016, we also introduced our new “We empower to perform” 
human resources strategy. Following a review of our strategic successes, 
this was then rebranded “Empower to transform” in November 2017. 
This strategy sets out five overarching objectives for personnel  
management in the Group:
 § The Volkswagen Group aims to be an excellent employer across  
all our brands and companies worldwide. 
 § Highly skilled and committed employees strive for excellence  
in innovation, value creation and customer focus. 
 § Sustainable work practices ensure optimal working conditions  
in factories and offices. 
 § An exemplary corporate culture creates a working atmosphere  
characterized by openness, mutual trust and cooperation.
 § While striving for operational excellence and adding strategic value, 
personnel management within the Group is strongly focused on 
employees.
 
In implementing this new strategy, the Volkswagen Group is con-
tinuing to pursue the successful key tenets of our human resources 
policy. As well as seeking to appropriately balance performance and 
remuneration, these include a strong stakeholder focus, comprehen-
sive employee participation rights, excellent training opportunities 
and the fostering of long-term service through systematic retention 
programs. Our new human resources strategy is also setting innova-
tive new trends. For instance, we are developing pioneering forms of 
work organization in our factories and offices, as well as new working 
time models to meet employees’ wishes for greater flexibility. 
the five action areas of our “empower to transform” strategy.

PeoPle and ResPonsibility  |  ManageMent aPPRoach
At the same time as planning the socially responsible, systematic 
transformation of our human resources function, we are investing 
heavily in training and upskilling programs to carry our workforce 
forward into the digital future. We are continually expanding our 
preventive healthcare offerings. 
Volkswagen is also set to roll out a diversity management system across 
the entire Group by 2020. Different cultural circumstances in global 
markets and increasingly dynamic economic conditions mean that we 
need an ever-broader range of experiences, world views, problem-solv-
ing approaches and ideas for products. The growing diversity of our 
workforce offers potential for innovation which could be leveraged 
even more effectively in future.
Our human resources strategy also addresses the causes and conse-
quences of the diesel emissions issue. Various initiatives for transform-
ing our corporate culture are already in progress, aiming to establish 
flatter hierarchies, a more open form of collaboration and a more 
broadly entrepreneurial perspective across the Group’s divisions. 
Volkswagen’s personnel development system underwent a thorough 
review in 2017; it now provides more transparent routes into manage-
ment with a greater emphasis on individual responsibility. At the same 
time, our management principles were revised and new criteria for 
appointments to management positions were defined.
In the course of 2017 we also revised our Group-wide Code of Conduct, 
further expanded the compliance system and continued the rollout of 
the Code of Cooperation as key pillars of Group-wide cooperation. 
We are implementing our strategy in nine Group-wide strategic 
initiatives which form the key operationalization tools for our human 
resources program. These initiatives are systematically aligned with our 
five principal strategic action areas.

Strategic Objective: 
Excellent Employer
Seeking to be an attractive employer is not an end in itself. We will 
only be able to sustain the enduring commitment and motivation 
of our employees if we keep the promises we have made about the 
working conditions in our company. And only if we can make these 
promises visible to the outside world will we be perceived as attractive 
in an increasingly competitive talent market, and consequently be 
able to attract and retain the best people.

Our “Empower to transform” strategy fuses the external and internal 
aspects of employer attractiveness by seamlessly reconciling the 
consistency of our employer’s promise with the real-world employee 
experience, that is, how our quality as an employer is actually per-
ceived by individuals on a day-to-day basis. 
Participation, individual responsibility and opportunities for person-
al growth are a very important part of our promise as an employer: 
inspired by visions of the “democratic enterprise”, we wish to see our 
employees become empowered, competent and confident “company 
citizens” who actively contribute to shaping the company and partici-
pate in decision-making processes.
Such a corporate culture is underpinned by binding standards that 
protect employees from arbitrary decisions in the workplace and 
safeguard their opportunities for participation.
EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
gRi 102-41
The cornerstones of collaborative and harmonious labor relations at 
Volkswagen are universal human rights and the conventions of the 
International Labour Organization. Based on these, we have agreed 
various charters and declarations with our Group European Works 
Council (GEWC) and Global Group Works Council (GGWC) that safe-
guard the collective rights of our employees in the workplace and the 
organization of their work. They include: 
 §  The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
 Volks wagen (the Volkswagen Social Charter). We set out the 
fundamental social rights of employees in this declaration in 2002. 
These are based on the relevant conventions of the International 
 Labour Organization. A revised version of the Social Charter was 
signed in 2012.
 § The Charter on Labor Relations. This charter came into force 
in autumn 2009 and combines greater consultative rights for 
 representative bodies with shared responsibilities. It defines the 
rights to information, consultation and co-determination 
 enjoyed by employee representatives of brands, companies and 
sites  represented on the GEWC and GGWC.
by any comparative measure, the employee turnover rate at volkswagen 
is very low, indicating that the strategic focus of our hR policies has 
successfully positioned us as an attractive employer.

PeoPle and ResPonsibility  |  stRategic obJective: excellent eMPloyeR
 § The Charter on Temporary Work. In November 2012, Volkswagen’s 
executive management, the GEWC and GGWC signed this char-
ter setting out the principles governing temporary work. These 
include, for example, a guide ratio of temporary employees to core 
workforce, stipulations on equal pay, equal treatment and training 
programs, plus a time limit of 36 months before the offer of a per-
manent position must be considered.
 § The Charter on Vocational Education and Training. As well as a 
high standard of education, the Group seeks to offer attractive de-
velopment opportunities at its various locations. Approved in 2015, 
this charter recognizes vocational training as a core aspect of labor 
relations. To implement the charter, the social partners define cer-
tain aspects such as the trainee selection process, the duration and 
quality of vocational training, plus the conditions for subsequently 
hiring trainees following an apprenticeship. 
 § In addition, there are a number of country and/or site-specific 
agreements that stipulate, for example, standards for training or 
preventive healthcare measures for individual Group companies. 
  
These policy foundations underpin the rights of employees and their 
elected representatives at Group level in the European and Global 
Works Councils. They provide a binding framework for the responsible 
development of existing local labor relations using cooperative conflict 
resolution approaches.
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION THROUGH ELECTED  
REPRESENTATIVES AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
gRi 102-41
Volkswagen has an internationally recognized culture of co-determina-
tion. At many sites, employees are represented in two ways: firstly, by a 
trade union, and secondly, by representatives elected to a works council. 
Many companies in the Group also have a supervisory board on which 
the workforce is represented. The International Charter on Labor Rela-
tions allows employee representatives around the world to conclude 
agreements with local management on specific rights to information, 
consultation and co-determination.
This widespread form of participation has proved highly successful 
over many decades. When major changes are expected, as in the case 
of the pact regarding the future of the Volkswagen brand that was ne-
gotiated in 2016 and to be implemented by 2020 for example, employ-
ee representatives are involved in the planning process from an early 
stage. This ensures that such processes of change are addressed jointly 
and have the support of all employees. We attach great importance to 
informing the workforce of changes as early as possible. Where bodies 
are composed equally of employee and employer representatives, 
both sides always receive all relevant information at the same time. 
These co-determination structures are by no means static, however. Our 
international employee representative bodies are constantly evolving in 
line with the ongoing development of the Group. Executive managers 
and employee representatives meet regularly to consult on relevant 
issues. For instance, all members of the GEWC and GGWC attend a joint 
session every year. As well as discussing the current situation at the 
various sites, the respective HR managers and Group executive manage-
ment also share information about future product and workforce plans 
and consult on social welfare and personnel standards.

REMUNERATION, REWARDING PERFORMANCE,  
PROFIT-SHARING AND RETIREMENT PROVISION
A reasonable income is the most important prerequisite for living 
an independent life. As stated in our worldwide Social Charter, all 
remuneration and benefits paid to our employees correspond at the 
very least to the statutory minimums in each country concerned. 
Furthermore, this not only applies to our own workforce, but to all 
our suppliers’ employees as well. As they are collectively agreed with 
trade unions, our rates of pay are usually considerably higher than 
the prevailing minimum levels. When setting pay, we make no gender 
 distinctions: people are recruited, hired and promoted solely on the 
basis of their qualifications and skills. Remuneration is based strictly 
on the job performed and individual performance. This is usually 
calculated according to a three-tier remuneration system comprising 
basic pay plus a performance-related component that additionally 
rewards each individual’s performance. The third component is an 
entitlement to a share in the profits as laid down in the collective 
agreement. This three-tier pay structure has proved to be a convenient 
way of enabling employees to share in the company’s success. 
Employees of Group companies also enjoy further benefits. De-
pending on location, these may include subsidized transport and 
meals, low-cost accommodation, monthly childcare allowances 
and discounts on certain leisure activities. Additional healthcare or 
supplementary pension benefits round off the range of company 
benefits offered.
Along with an attractive remuneration package for our active employ-
ees, we are also concerned to make provision for those embarking on 
the next stage of their life. By offering occupational pension schemes, 
Volkswagen AG, its brands and subsidiaries make an important 
contribution to ensuring that retirees still have an income in later life. 
In addition to employer contributions, employees can convert part of 
their pre-tax salary into pension contributions. 
The extensive social rights enjoyed by employees, strong workforce 
representation, participation in decision-making processes, perfor-
mance-related remuneration and good retirement provision form 
the building blocks of our attractiveness as an employer and together 
constitute the bedrock of our human resources policy. These aspects 
are further augmented by numerous initiatives, agreements and pro-
grams which aim to develop our workforce and create versatile, highly 
qualified teams.

Strategic Objective: 
Skilled and Committed Employees
The second goal of our human resources strategy is to cultivate 
skilled and committed employees. For us, commitment means first 
and foremost actively helping to create value, but also taking change 
in one’s stride and personally initiating process improvements. It 
also means seeing the bigger picture and taking an interest in the 
environment and developments in society at large. We practice such 
corporate citizenship in numerous initiatives – for example in our 
support for volunteering activities, in the aid the Group provides to 
refugees, in the now traditional campaign where employees donate 
the odd cents on their monthly pay slips to “One Hour for the Future”, 
or the work of the Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation. Added to this 
are the  donations – €28.2 million in 2017 – which the Group makes 
directly to charitable causes. 
ON-THE-JOB COMMITMENT
We like to see our employees tackling their work enthusiastically, show-
ing commitment and team spirit while contributing their expertise. In 
return, we invest in our workforce, foster a good working atmosphere 
and offer attractive opportunities for career development. As well as 
listening to their opinions and constructive criticism, this includes 
actively involving our workforce in improving processes and assuring 
quality. 
One tool used for this purpose throughout the Group is our  Employee 
Opinion Survey. We use this standardized Group-wide survey to obtain 
regular feedback on employee satisfaction, and by  extension on 
the extent to which we have fulfilled our goal of being an attractive 
employer. The survey also helps to systematically identify scope 
for improvement and pinpoint the areas where managers need to 
take action within their organizational units. In 2016, we revised 
the  Employee Opinion Survey to include additional questions and 
new tools to help line managers discuss the results with  employees. 
The 2017 survey was conducted at 156 sites and companies in 
48  countries. Approximately 453,000 of over 570,000 employees in 
the participating Group companies responded; this is equivalent to a 
response rate of 79%. In 2017, the score on the employee satisfaction 
index – a key indicator generated by the opinion survey – was 78.3 out 
of 100 possible index points, and thus on a par with the previous year.
Our ideas management program is another important tool for 
 encouraging employee engagement. This program enables employees 
to bring their creativity, knowledge and initiative to bear and take 
responsibility for improving both processes and products. By 2017, 
over 54,000 ideas had been submitted, saving the company approxi-
mately €124 million at German sites operated by Volkswagen AG, 
Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH and Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH. Ideas 
management is an important leadership and motivational tool for 
plant supervisors and managers. It also contributes to improving 
health and safety in the Volkswagen workplace and helps us reach our 
targets for reducing energy and water consumption, waste, solvents 
and CO2 emissions.

SYSTEMATIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
As well as commitment, we place an equally strong emphasis on 
developing employees’ skills. Our education and training system is 
highly sophisticated, and we maintain close ties with public educa-
tional establishments such as vocational schools and universities all 
over the world. 
Well educated employees who regularly update their skills are vital to 
our company. We therefore regularly review the level of our employees’ 
skills and qualifications in order to identify any further education and 
training options that might be suitable for them.

Our initiatives for enabling employees to acquire further qualifica-
tions are organized around occupational “families” (Berufsfamilien). 
Employees who require similar skills to perform their jobs and who 
possess the associated competencies are said to belong to an occu-
pational family. The general and technical competencies required 
for each specific activity are defined in skills profiles. Employees are 
offered a wide range of opportunities to gain further qualifications, 
allowing them to continually update their skills and deepen their 
knowledge throughout their working lives. In the process, they 
also learn from more experienced colleagues who act as experts and 
pass on their know-how in our occupational family academies.
DUAL MODEL OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION  
AND TRAINING
The dual model of vocational education and training, in which 
theory and practice are closely intertwined, builds the foundations 
for the advanced skills and excellent performance the Volkswagen 
Group demands. Occupations in Germany are always certified by the 
relevant Chamber of Commerce and Industry and follow generally 
applicable standards, as prescribed by the German Federal Institute 
for  Vocational Training, for instance. Outside Germany, we also apply 
these high German standards, but the content of training courses 
is then also aligned with the national standards and requirements 
in the country concerned. Here, too, the content of the training is 
very much geared to the skills required in the various occupational 
families.  Volkswagen has rolled out this dual model at many of its 
locations outside  Germany as well, and continues to promote the 
model as the core framework for acquiring skilled worker qualifica-
tions. When planning new plants, we factor in dual vocational training 
as standard from the outset. Accordingly, more than three-quarters 
of all trainees in the Group are now learning their trades through the 
dual system. 
As at the end of 2017, the Volkswagen Group had trained 19,207 young 
people in some 50 recognized occupations. We also  support the 
career development of new entrants once they have completed their 
apprenticeship. Particularly talented young skilled workers are sup-
ported through “talent groups”. These two-year  training and develop-
ment programs recruit the best 10% of apprentices from each year’s 
intake at Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH in Zwickau. 
105 skilled workers joined the programs during the year under review, 
taking the total to 956 young men and women since talent groups 
were first launched in 2008. 
On completion of an apprenticeship, the “Wanderjahre” (year abroad) 
program offers young people the opportunity to spend twelve months 
working for a Group company abroad. During the reporting year, 
31 Volkswagen Group sites in 17 countries took part in this develop-
ment program. For the first time, a group of 12 such trainees were sent 
to Volkswagen (China) Investment Co. Ltd. in Beijing. In 2017, 67 par-
ticipants from Germany plus 16 from seven other countries began 
their year abroad within the Volkswagen Group in Germany.

EXTENSIVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AT ALL LEVELS
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, skilled workers can choose from 
a broad range of advanced training courses – from further training 
in occupational or cross-disciplinary areas of general interest to the 
company, to specific qualifications in occupational families, through 
to comprehensive personal development programs. In this way, all our 
employees are able to pursue lifelong learning. This further training 
is also largely based on the dual-study model, which combines theory 
with practical experience. Overall, around 93,000 qualification activi-
ties totaling 13.9 million hours of training were completed across the 
Group in 2017. Over 435 courses and programs were newly developed 
for the Volkswagen brand alone.
We have standardized many of the development programs and selec-
tion procedures for executives, managers and group leaders across 
the Group. During the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group Academy 
ran some 524 training programs and assessment centers for execu-
tives, managers and group leaders in 12 countries.
ACADEMIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
As part of the Volkswagen Group Academy, AutoUni employs top 
in-house experts and collaborates with higher-education institutions 
to equip the company with leading-edge knowledge for the future. 
Its programs and collaborative study modules use a blended-learning 
format which combines face-to-face classroom teaching with online 
content, supplemented by lectures and conferences. In 2017, around 
9,450 people took part in over 170 AutoUni events all over the world; 
a growing number were transmitted to the Group’s various locations 
via Skype.
AutoUni cooperates with internationally renowned universities, 
 institutes and research centers on numerous research projects, disser-
tations and theses, and offers PhD students in the Group a platform 
for exchanging ideas and gaining interdisciplinary qualifications. 
As at the end of 2017, around 360 PhD students were engaged in 
researching topics of future interest to Volkswagen’s various Group 
companies in Germany. 
In addition, AutoUni facilitates networking between the Group’s 
in-house contacts for higher-education institutions and keeps track 
of collaborative links with universities around the globe: during the 
year under review, over 1,700 national and international cooperation 
agreements were in place with universities, research institutes and 
universities of applied sciences.
All these measures are aimed at maintaining and enhancing the 
high standard of skills and the outstanding expertise of Volkswagen 
employees at Group locations all over the world. Above all, we are 
committed to delivering teaching and learning in our  occupational 
families by following the dual vocational training model, which 
integrates theory and practice in a mutually reinforcing continuum. 
Systematic knowledge transfer by in-house experts at all levels and 
across all brands and specialist fields is another key factor under-
pinning our success.
   
 
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE 
Our efforts to ensure that our employees have well-developed skills 
and a high level of commitment address the first two facets of our 
strategic objective to cultivate “skilled and committed employees”. 
However, alongside a willingness to perform (through participation) 
and empowerment to perform (through having the right qualifica-
tions), there is a third facet, namely capability. This requires our work-
force to be physically and mentally capable of coping with the stresses 
and strains of work. 
Consequently, we do not simply regard the protection and promotion 
of our employees’ health as a self-evident societal obligation and 
reflection of our corporate culture, but also as an integral part of our 
human resources strategy. Volkswagen’s holistic approach to health 
management goes well beyond statutory preventive healthcare and 
occupational safety; it also includes aspects such as work organiza-
tion, ergonomics, prevention, integration and rehabilitation, along 
with leadership culture.
As well as complying with Group guidelines on protecting and pro-
moting health, the medical and healthcare services we provide for our 
employees are in line with the relevant statutory requirements and 
internal regulations at each site. Among other things, we maintain 
a register of jobs that may pose particular problems (list of occupa-
tional diseases) and offer employees in these jobs special prevention 
programs plus increased opportunities for workplace job rotation. 
All sites have at least emergency health provision, while most also 
offer medical services under the oversight of a physician.

In the context of health, sustainability means ensuring that,  ideally, 
every employee is still healthy when they retire. Protecting and 
 promoting employees’ health is a priority for the company, shared by 
both management and employee representatives. As part of our 
strategy process, we have launched our own Group health initiative. 
During its very first year, the initiative had developed and imple-
mented some basic concepts relating to prevention, workplace health 
management and ergonomics throughout the Group. The aims of 
the health initiative are clearly defined: to improve employees’ quality 
of life, reduce stress, avoid chronic illnesses and consequently also 
boost employees’ performance and reduce absenteeism.

IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the con-
tinuous improvement of occupational safety is vitally important to 
us. As long ago as 2004, the Volkswagen Group drew up an occupa-
tional safety policy which is binding on all Group companies around 
the globe. The same high standards of work organization and occu-
pational safety apply worldwide. For this purpose, in 2010 the Group 
launched its own occupational safety management system (KAMS). 
This system is used to analyze the organizational structures and pro-
cesses for occupational safety at all participating Group companies. 
The findings are held in a central database with Group-wide access. 
To improve information sharing, in recent years the exchange of 
reports on serious and fatal accidents within the Group has been 
introduced. This enables us to take specific action to prevent similar 
accidents across all our sites in the future. Since 2012, Volkswagen 
in Germany has also been running mandatory occupational safety 
training modules for all prospective managers. The group leader 
 qualification modules have likewise been standardized so that occu-
pational safety forms a mandatory part of basic group leader training. 
As a result, we have successfully managed to keep the accident fre-
quency in our companies at a consistently low level.

the accident frequency index is a measure of the frequency with which 
accidents at work occurred in relation to the total number of hours 
worked. the formula for calculating the index is: number of occupational 
accidents, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of hours worked.
the accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents were 
by calculating the ratio of the total number of lost working days to the 
number of hours worked. the formula for calculating the index is: number 
of working days lost, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of 
hours worked.

For manufacturing companies in particular, sickness-related absences 
from the workplace are not only a significant cost factor, they also pre-
sent major logistical challenges when planning, for example, shift rotas. 
increased availability of diagnostic and screening measures can help 
reduce absenteeism. the working time lost to the company is calculated 
using the following formula: days of absence x 100/payment-relevant 
days i.e. days when employees are expected to be at work.

PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE AND REHABILITATION
Preventing accidents and avoiding risks in the workplace is one side 
of the occupational health equation; individual preventive measures 
are the other. The Volkswagen Checkup – a free, comprehensive 
health screening program for all employees – is now established at 
all Volkswagen AG German sites and helps employees stay fit and 
healthy and maintain their performance. Employees appreciate the 
high-quality diagnostics and follow-up preventive healthcare and 
exercise programs. 13,237 checkups were carried out at Volkswagen 
AG sites in 2017, slightly below the level of the previous year, in 
which 14,323 checkups were performed.
This checkup has now been successfully rolled out to almost all 
international sites. Other preventive healthcare programs have 
been brought into line with Group-wide standards. In many cases, 
 country-specific supplementary examinations, such as HIV and 
 tuber culosis tests, have been added. 
At many sites, we offer a tailored rehabilitation program to reinte-
grate employees following serious or prolonged illness, providing 
specific job-related support at an early stage. The aim is to restore 
an  m ployee’s ability to work within three to six months at most.
Further information on our brands’ programs for healthcare  
in the workplace can be found at: 
– ŠKODA | Prevention in focus
At Volkswagen AG, a rehabilitation program may also include specially 
tailored services, depending on a person’s individual needs in each 
case. Examples are “JobReha” which offers one to three weeks of 
outpatient, day-patient or inpatient treatment, mainly for muscu-
loskeletal problems, and the “RehaFit” program, which focuses on 
orthopedic or psychological rehabilitation. Other examples include 
physiotherapy and general or targeted stamina-building exercises 
at workplace fitness centers. We are also steadily expanding our 
provision of support and counseling services for employees with 
mental-health or psychosomatic problems.
If an employee falls ill, our involvement is not solely limited to pro-
viding assistance of a medical nature, however. Volkswagen AG also 
supplements benefits paid by social insurance providers, such as sick 
pay, and provides support to relatives of employees who die. The com-
pany also has a collective accident insurance scheme which insures 
employees against accidents resulting in death or disability. In excep-
tional circumstances of financial need, Volkswagen AG can also offer 
employees short-term loans.
Robots perform tasks that would not be ergonomic  
for humans.

Strategic Objective: 
Work Organization Fit for the Future
A job’s attractiveness depends first and foremost on the workplace 
itself. Consequently, we endeavor to provide an innovative working 
environment in our plants and offices which allows individuals to 
fulfill their potential. This includes introducing new approaches 
such as Scrum and design thinking in knowledge work, as well as 
innovative practices on the shop floor, for instance by systemati cally 
designing technology around the workforce and creating more 
opportunities for participation. In addition, we offer working time 
models tailored to individual employees’ requirements and specific 
programs for workers with performance impairments; in these 
 cases in particular, individually tailored forms of work organization 
can significantly boost performance and job satisfaction levels. 
Volkswagen AG’s Work2Work program has been creating new career 
opportunities for employees with differing abilities since 2001. An 
employee’s current potential is matched to workplace requirements 
so that despite a given disability, the individual is nevertheless 
still able to create significant value. More than 2,000 employees have 
benefited from this program in recent years, and 812 people are 
currently employed in Work2Work jobs in Wolfsburg across some 
100 different activities.  
In 2017, we published an Inclusion Report for Volkswagen AG for 
the first time. This set out our experiences over many years of inte-
grating employees with impairments or differing abilities. 
We are also committed to employees with disabilities in other 
countries. For instance, over 200 people with disabilities work in five 
sheltered workshops and other workplaces at ŠKODA production 
plants in Czechia. 
Creating the workplaces of the future also involves making them 
barrier-free for people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that 
all employees, regardless of any impairment, can access and use 
all buildings, information and communication facilities without 
assistance.

FLEXIBLE WORKING TIME MODELS
Flexible working time plays a significant role in innovative work 
organization models. Volkswagen is constantly working to further 
enhance the ease with which our employees can combine work 
and family life and thus cater to the particular needs of new parents, 
single parents or employees who are also carers, for example. The 
high levels of uptake of benefits such as parental leave confirm the 
success of this policy.

In September 2016, Volkswagen AG introduced a far-reaching com-
pany agreement governing mobile working, i.e. work away from 
the usual workplace. Such agreements are satisfying the wishes of 
many employees for more flexibility in choosing where and when 
they work. Other Group brands such as Audi and Porsche have 
 similar arrangements. 
Volkswagen AG offers exceptional flexibility in its undertaking to 
re-employ workers who take extended leave: for the past 20 years 
or so, employees have been able to take up to eight years’ leave of 
absence without having to give a reason. Regardless of whether this 
leave is used for a sabbatical, for parental leave or for career devel-
opment purposes, employees have a guaranteed right to re-employ-
ment on the same terms and conditions as before.
We also offer a wide range of options for taking a leave of absence to 
care for close family members. Employees are entitled to take up to 
10 working days of leave at short notice, for example to make arrange-
ments for the appropriate care of a relative who has been taken ill. 
They may also take up to six months part-time or full-time leave to 
care for a family member themselves. Another option offered is part-
time working for up to 24 months in order to meet care obligations.
We believe these options greatly contribute to the present and future 
attractiveness of work at Volkswagen, and consequently help ensure 
that the company remains competitive.

Strategic Objective: 
Exemplary Leadership and Corporate Culture
As part of the Group’s TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 program, we 
began a process of radical transformation from the ground up. This 
includes ideas and initiatives for revitalizing our corporate culture. 
For instance, back in 2016 we formulated new Group-wide manage-
ment principles and reviewed the criteria for appointments to 
management positions. In 2017, we worked on implementing this 
new model throughout the Group. Another important new policy 
introduced in 2016 was the Code of Cooperation, which establishes 
a clearly defined set of values for all interactions within the Group. 
As the code defines the ground rules for trust-based collaboration 
within the Group, it also constitutes a key pillar of our strategy. Us-
ing terms such as “trust”, “genuine”, “straightforward”, “open-minded”, 
“as equals” and “united”, it describes how  employees should cooperate 
within our brand network.
Following the definition of the new corporate culture through 
wide-ranging participative processes the year before, 2017 saw the 
rollout of this new culture. Company executives are important role 
models during cultural transformation. Accordingly, in 2017 around 
7,300 executives, managers and works council representatives from 
Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Sachsen and Volkswagen Osnabrück 
took part in the Volkswagen Integrity, Culture and Compliance Con-
vention, spread over 14 days. They discussed the importance of the 
issues for the company and for themselves. In particular, discussions 
centered on how executives can set an example by showing integ-
rity and communicating corporate culture and compliance in their 
everyday working lives. An e-learning program on these three aspects 
enabled participants to prepare the topics in advance.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS LEVERS OF CHANGE
As part of our commitment to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, we champion diversity and equal opportunities 
at all our locations around the world. Our position is crystal clear: 
 Volkswagen stands for respect, tolerance and cultural openness. We 
guarantee equal opportunities and equal treatment irrespective 
of ethnicity, race, gender, disability, ideology, faith, nationality, sexual 
orientation, social background or political conviction, provided the 
latter is based on democratic principles and tolerance toward those 
who hold different views. The Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct, 
which was jointly agreed with our social partners in the Social Charter 
in 2002, underpins these aspirations throughout the Group.  Under 
the code, every employee and member of an executive board is 
responsible for ensuring that colleagues work together in partner-
ship and is obliged to report any breaches immediately.
If any employee feels they are a victim of discrimination, they may 
contact trained Group experts for advice and support. At the initiative 
of the Works Council, employees’ obligations and rights to non- 
discrimination were laid down in 1996 in the “Cooperative Conduct 
at the Workplace” company agreement applicable to all Volkswagen 
AG employees at all its sites. The agreement also covers bullying and 
other forms of discrimination. Every new employee receives a copy 
of it when they join the company and the contents are also covered 
in management training courses. In the event of any breaches, 
 employees can also reference the agreement when submitting a 
complaint. All complaints must be investigated; if they are found to 
be substantiated, appropriate action must be taken immediately.

ENHANCING EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS AND 
 TARGETED ADVANCEMENT PROGRAMS 
To Volkswagen, a family-aware human resources policy represents one 
of the key qualities of an attractive employer and is an important lever 
for ensuring greater gender equality. Accordingly, we are continuously 
working to develop family-friendly working time  models and increase 
the proportion of women in management roles. 
As a voluntary undertaking, the Group first proposed  differentiated 
targets for the proportion of female employees in our German work-
force back in 2011. The following principle applies: we recruit the best 
graduates from each year in the required disciplines, taking as our 
starting point the proportion of female graduates on each course. 
When all the courses of relevance to Volkswagen are averaged out, 
these differentiated quotas produce a female graduate recruitment 
target of 30%.

Bringing more qualified women into the company will enable us to 
steadily increase the percentage of female executives over the coming 
years. 
As part of the revitalization of our corporate culture, in 2017 we also 
focused our efforts on implementing a specific diversity manage-
ment approach. This drive centers around binding quotas stipulated 
for women in managerial positions and targets for the international 
composition (internationality) of our management boards. These two 
figures are combined in our diversity index, which has been in force 
since 1 January 2017. The diversity index forms part of our human 
resources strategy and applies throughout the Volkswagen Group. We 
use the index as a tool for measuring and managing the implemen-
tation of our equal opportunities and internationality targets for top 
management. The calculation is based on current workforce figures. 
In 2017, the proportion of women in management positions was 
13.8%; we are targeting 20.2% by 2025. We are also aiming to increase 
the internationality of our top management level from 18.7% in the 
financial year just ended to 25.0% by 2025. These targets are decided 
by the Group’s Board of Management and are binding for the whole 
organization. 
As well as introducing systematic diversity management, as required 
by German law we have also defined targets for the percentage of 
female managers at Volkswagen AG. In tune with Germany’s law on 
equal participation for women and men in executive positions, 
Volkswagen AG has set itself targets for increasing the proportion of 
women in management by the end of 2021: 13% on the first level of 
management and 16.9% on the second level. As at 31 December 2017, 
the proportion of women in the active workforce on the first level 
of management was 10.4% (2016: 9.8%), while on the second level the 
proportion was 14.0% (2016: 13.5%).

In the year under review, the proportion of women in managerial 
roles in the Volkswagen Group in Germany rose to 9.2% in senior 
management and 13.2% in management generally (as at year end, 
excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche). The proportion of women in 
top management increased from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.5% in the report-
ing year (as at year end, excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche). The 
proportion of women in management across the Group in Germany 
(excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche) therefore came to 11.4%, up 
from 11.0% the year before.
We are taking a variety of measures to encourage this trend. For 
 instance, 2017 saw a fourth cohort embark on our cross-brand 
management mentoring program, with 55 women participating 
(mainly from the Volkswagen Group in Germany). In addition, 
Volkswagen  offers the “Kompass” program specifically to encourage 
female talent to aim for a career in management. Over the reporting 
period, 60 women from Volkswagen AG, MAN, Volkswagen Sachsen 
GmbH, Volkswagen Osnabrück, Volkswagen Financial Services AG 
and  Autovision GmbH took part in this program. There is a key differ-
ence  between the objectives of the two programs: while “Kompass” 
prepares women for potential leadership roles at Volkswagen, the 
mentoring program is aimed at women in the talent pipeline who 
have already been identified as potential high flyers.
Volkswagen aims to attract female students at an early stage. Our 
 Germany-wide “Woman DrivING Award” and “Woman Experience 
Day” both target female engineering and IT students and graduates, 
aiming to interest them in technical careers with us. 
In addition, Volkswagen is aiming to increase the proportion of female 
skilled workers and group leaders in Germany to 10%. In the 2017 
fiscal year, the percentage of female skilled workers in the Volkswagen 
Group in Germany (excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche) was 7.6%, 
and 4.9% for group leaders.
In order to increase the proportion of female trainees in  industrial 
and technical trades from 23.0% in 2017 to 30% in 2020, we are 
speci fically seeking to attract female talent, for example by arranging 
special work experience and orientation days for young women. The 
aim of these events is to give these young women a taste of training in 
these technical occupations and help them make career  choices. For 
many years, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche,  Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, MAN and Volkswagen Financial Services 
brands have participated in the Germany-wide “Girls’ Day” or “Day of 
the  Future” event. During the reporting year, the “Girls’ Day” format 
 offered more than 2,000 female school students a practical insight into 
the industrial/technical careers on offer in the automotive sector. 
Another step on the way to becoming a family-friendly enterprise 
is our ongoing expansion of tailored childcare provision. Both in 
Germany and other countries, we have found that providing childcare 
facilities in the vicinity of company premises is beneficial. In addition 
to well-established existing facilities, in recent years we have set up a 
number of daycare centers near our operating locations. 
All German sites of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and MAN brands also offer childcare 
during school holidays. 
With these wide-ranging measures, we are confident that we are 
making a real contribution not only to greater diversity, but also to 
a culture of openness and inclusiveness across all our brands and 
companies.

Strategic Objective: 
First-Rate HR Organization
All the objectives and activities described here require a solid foun-
dation. As a company, we believe only strong personnel management 
focused on the interests of both the company and our employees can 
provide the basis for good work policies in an environmentally and 
socially responsible enterprise.
Highly skilled and qualified HR staff are crucial for implementing 
human resources policies that motivate people to perform their best. 
Accordingly, our final strategic objective is to continuously improve 
our HR organization. The goal we have set ourselves is ambitious – 
to shape and support all upcoming change and transformation pro-
cesses in the company, without ever losing sight of our objective of 
creating highly productive, people-friendly working environments.
To attain this vision, we are currently improving the organization of 
our personnel management function. Future efforts will center firstly 
on the digital transformation of work processes, and secondly on 
realigning personnel management.
Our “Empower to transform” human resources strategy formulates 
our previous personnel management objectives in more detail. Not 
only will we ensure that our top teams have the requisite skills; in 
collaboration with our specialist departments we will work on laying 
the foundations for enabling the teams to achieve their full potential – 
among other things by bolstering their ability to continually adapt to 
constantly changing circumstances.

Human Rights
As globalization continues to advance, value creation is increasingly 
shifting toward individual sales markets. This trend effectively in-
creases our responsibility for our activities worldwide – including the 
safeguarding of human rights.
Consequently, as the fundamental bedrock underlying all our activities, 
we respect, protect and support all laws around the world that aim to 
protect universal human rights. We reject all forms of child, forced or 
compulsory labor, modern slavery and human trafficking. Naturally, 
this not only applies to our own activities within the Group, but also 
to our relationships with business partners and to their conduct.
Our production and sales exist within globally interlinked structures. 
Human rights risks lie primarily in our upstream value chain and 
in resource extraction industries. Nevertheless, we clearly recognize 
the fact that our company is not completely immune to these risks. 
The cornerstones of collaborative and harmonious labor relations at 
Volkswagen Group are a raft of charters and declarations agreed with 
our Group European Works Council and Global Group Works Council. 
They safeguard employment rights and human rights, such as the 
right to freedom of association, collective bargaining, equal pay, and 
the prohibition of discrimination in the workplace.
To safeguard universal human rights, we take our lead from various 
international, European and national agreements. These include:
 § the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
 § the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
 § the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  
by the International Labour Organization (ILO),
 § the European Convention on Human Rights, 
 § the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and
 § the German federal government’s National Action Plan for Business 
and Human Rights.
Furthermore, we have clearly set out our Group-wide policy on 
safe guarding universal human rights and what we expect of our 
 employees in this regard in our Code of Conduct. The issue of 
human rights is covered in the section on “Our responsibilities as 
a member of society”. 
Extensively revised in 2017, the Code of Conduct now applies to all 
employees at all levels across all our brands and companies. The parts 
pertaining to human rights were completely revised and substantially 
  expanded. Our Corporate Guidelines also lay down further principles. 
 
PROCESSES FOR SAFEGUARDING HUMAN RIGHTS
We aim to identify human rights risks at the earliest possible juncture 
and act to continually minimize them. We consider the Group’s 
impact on people along our entire value chain. For this reason, we are 
constantly working toward establishing human rights due diligence 
at all levels of our value chain.
Our Risk Management System (RMS) and Internal Control System (ICS) 
are described in Volkswagen AG’s Annual Report (in the Report on 
Risks and Opportunities). The application of these RMS/ICS systems 
across the Group enables the timely identification of risks, including 
the risk of human rights violations.
Other tools used for this purpose include country risk analyses, 
 business partner screenings, questionnaire-based monitoring, 
plus the installation of early warning systems and performance of 
 supplier audits where human rights violations are suspected. 
Volkswagen’s worldwide ombudsman system is our point of contact 
for reporting suspected internal or external cases of non-compliance 
with our sustainability requirements, including infringements of 
 human rights in the supply chain. This system can be used to confi-
dentially report any suspicions – in one of 11 different languages – to 
two independent lawyers appointed by the Group.
If employees, business partners or customers suspect that anyone in 
our employ is acting unlawfully, they can report this transparently 
via a number of whistleblower system channels. The main focus of 
our whistleblower system is on obtaining information about serious 
breaches as specified in our guidelines. Human rights violations are 
a typical example of issues where the criteria for a serious breach are

automatically met. The whistleblower system guarantees the greatest 
possible protection for both whistleblowers themselves and the 
 people affected, and follows strict rules to ensure that the process is 
fair, transparent and swift.  
Both employees and third parties can report possible breaches to the 
Volkswagen Group’s national and international employee representa-
tive bodies, or to national and international trade union federations.
As part of our Sustainability in Supplier Relations program, we raise 
our employees’ awareness of and provide them with continuous 
training in issues relating to human rights, risks and trends, as well 
as the principles enshrined in our Group-wide Code of Conduct. We 
are currently also conducting an in-depth review of the human rights 
section of our Code of Conduct. We use real-life examples of potential 
human rights violations to illustrate the individual issues and help 
employees put the Code of Conduct’s rules into practice. Informing 
and training employees at all levels in our companies is an essential 
part of our compliance efforts.

our sustainability in supplier Relations concept can be found in sections:

We also believe we have a special responsibility to protect groups along

partner for society. Reliability, trustworthiness and fairness are 
our watchwords – no matter whether we are talking to individual 
 employees, negotiating with collective representative bodies, collab-
orating with regional partners in local infrastructure development 
projects, or cooperating with civil society initiatives and associations.
Our “Empower to transform” human resources strategy seeks to 
 ensure that the Group, our brands and our workforce are well placed 
to adapt to the ever more rapidly evolving challenges of the networked 
digital world. Our human resources strategy is designed to help the 
Volkswagen Group become a global leader in sustainable mobility on 
an enduringly profitable basis. 
Nor does our responsibility to people stop at our factory gates – as a 
good “corporate citizen”, we see ourselves as a driver of local growth, 
contributing to structural development and equal opportunities 
wherever we operate. As part of our strategic approach, we are con-
stantly looking to expand our support for social, cultural and commu-
nity projects that are building a better future.  
CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP 
We have always believed in the importance of recognizing our social 
responsibilities toward our stakeholders. As a multinational enter-
prise, we bear a global responsibility that extends beyond our factory 
gates. The main focus of our corporate social engagement activities 
is on supporting local development, educational and  community 
 projects at many of our sites. Actively responding to societal  challenges 
such as the current refugee situation represents one of the core 
 imperatives of our corporate social responsibility.
We consider it important to take a strategic approach to social engage-
ment, so we select and develop our projects with great care – both 
independently and in collaboration with local partner organizations 
and NGOs. Local on-site project management allows us to react 
 flexibly to our stakeholders’ needs or anxieties. 
We are also seeking to obtain a more complete picture of the effective-
ness of our projects. Building on the London Benchmarking Group’s 
input-output-impact (IOI) model for measuring the effectiveness of 
community engagement initiatives, we have analyzed selected pro-
jects to find out who they benefit. As part of this process, we have also 
aggregated our inputs across the Group and recorded the different 
objectives in detail. This extensive pool of data provides us with an 
overview of the contexts, objectives and impacts of our involvement 
in environmental and community projects. 
Based on this information, we will revise our corporate  citizenship 
strategy in 2018 and define new areas of focus in line with  TOGETHER – 
Strategy 2025. Following a review of our corporate citizenship con-
cepts, we will define appropriate objectives and specific performance 
indicators, along with methods for measuring the effectiveness of 
these strategic initiatives.
In our corporate citizenship endeavors, we have always been guided 
by two principles: continuity and participation.
Over the reporting year, we were extensively involved in some 
250 projects around the globe aiming to improve economic and 
social structures. We also provided emergency assistance on an 
 ad-hoc basis, following natural disasters such as, for example, the 
severe flooding in South Asia and the USA.
Project selection and implementation are guided by our Group-wide 
policies, which provide the decision-making framework for all our 
community activities:
 § The projects align with our corporate mission while addressing a 
global challenge or a specific local issue.
 § They are an expression of the diversity within the Group and the 
socio-cultural environment in which the projects are carried out. 
 § They are developed in close consultation with local stakeholders, 
who are also involved in their implementation.
 § Projects are managed locally under the responsibility of the units 
operating there.
 
By taking into account both local and wider priorities, we are able to 
meet the diverse expectations of our stakeholders. In 2017, the Group 
and all our brands and regions were involved in around 250 projects 
that encompassed development, infrastructure and educational 
initiatives, as well as community projects. Due to the various different 
local circumstances and challenges involved, the projects took on 
numerous different forms.

MAIN CORPORATE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
We give donations in cash and in kind to support activities and 
projects primarily devoted to research and education, culture, sports 
and social causes. Donations may only be given to recognized 
non-profit organizations or ones specifically endorsed to receive 
donations. We do not make any donations to political parties, party- 
affiliated foundations or individual politicians. In the reporting 
 period,  Volkswagen AG made donations amounting to €28.2 million.
Added to this amount are the donations made by our  employees, 
which go to help support people in need in the vicinity of 
 Volkswagen AG’s various locations. In 2017, Wolfsburg employees 
alone donated more than €460,000. 
One of our largest projects is our strategic partnership with the 
 German Red Cross, which will remain in place for the next three years.
Since the summer of 2003, this initiative has also included the collec-
tion of “spare cents”, whereby Volkswagen employees in Germany and 
abroad donate the odd cents on their monthly pay slips to the “One 
Hour for the Future” campaign. The funds raised are used to support  
a total of 140 projects in seven countries around the world.
Another workforce initiative led to the sale of sustainably farmed 
 fair-trade products in the company’s cafes and restaurants, where the 
sale of products bearing the Fairtrade seal has been promoted since 
1999. Through this commitment, we are helping producers in devel-
oping countries establish socially sustainable businesses. 
The Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation, established in 2011, is 
playing an increasingly significant role in our community activities. 
This charitable foundation aims to support youth outreach as well 
as vocational education and training at all levels, with projects that 
focus on the neighborhoods of Group sites worldwide. It runs projects 
in cooperation with children’s charity terre des hommes. Since 2011, 
the Volkswagen Employees’ Foundation has launched or supported 
more than 20 projects in Germany and elsewhere. 
educating – language courses for various levels of ability  
(here at aUdi ag).
integrating – Work placements offer initial insights  
into working in germany.

Alongside these projects, which are directly supported by Volkswagen 
or the Volkswagen Works Council, we also encourage our employees 
to volunteer for local causes in their free time. To coordinate and 
provide targeted support for volunteering activities, we have made 
the “ Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt” (Volkswagen Supports Volunteering) 
initiative an integral part of our personnel management. Since 2007, 
around 2,600 volunteers have been matched to suitable vacancies 
through this volunteer exchange.
Volkswagen employees who are looking for a new challenge following 
retirement can register with our company “Senior Experts” team. 
This offers them the opportunity to contribute their expertise region-
ally or  globally, either within the company or by providing voluntary 
support to external organizations. In 2017, around 135 Senior Experts 
took part in projects of their choosing, putting their accumulated 
specialist knowledge to good use and contributing to a valuable inter-
generational exchange of experience. During the reporting year, 
28 departments and more than 20 Volkswagen sites worldwide 
 benefited from the program. 
 
 
HELPING REFUGEES: MEETING,  
EDUCATING, INTEGRATING 
Since the summer of 2015, we have been enthusiastically helping 
to support the wave of refugees arriving in Germany. At present, we 
 believe the most urgent priorities for refugees are to learn German 
and acquire entry-level qualifications, as these are the keys for 
unlocking access to further education and training and entering 
the labor market. By the end of 2017, we had helped approximately 
3,500  refugees access language and foundation training courses. 
The help provided by the Volkswagen Group, its brands and com-
panies centered on the following three strands, in which the follow-
ing  activities were organized for refugees during 2017:

 § Meeting: Providing support for several thousand refugees by 
means of donations, volunteering and social events.
 § Educating: Grants for 100 refugees; language and integration 
 courses for 1,600+ refugees over several months; classes for 
 systematic help with integration and employability skills for 90 
refugees; support for minors at school.
 § Integrating: Work placements and internships for 500 refugees; 
skills assessments and career guidance for over 1,300 refugees, 
introductory training, vocational training and work for around 
130 refugees.
In addition, we complement the large-scale voluntary work of our 
workforce by contributing the services of experts, making dona-
tions in kind and providing vehicles for aid organizations. Evolving 
out of initial efforts to provide immediate aid, our brands and their 
 employees have been involved in developing a wide variety of short 
and long-term social support initiatives.
At various stages of their educational journey, we also help  refugees 
learn the language, obtain qualifications and understand  German 
 culture. This begins with the very youngest: the Volkswagen  Employees’ 
Foundation supports children and adolescents through three years 
of school by funding language learning, integration and the acqui-
sition of qualifications with donations totaling around €2.5 million. 
We also help refugees obtain university degrees. In cooperation 
with the charity start-up “Kiron Open Higher Education”, we sponsor 
 university places in IT and engineering.

 our sustainability indicators relating to products and production and to people  
and responsibility have developed over recent years.

Appendix  |  SUppLeMenTARY indiCATORS
As in previous years, we present key environmental indicators for our 
production operations in reporting year 2017. 
The indicators presented here include selected environmental data 
for the Volkswagen Group in aggregated form. The data is collected, 
checked and approved at our production sites in line with an internal 
standard (VW Standard 98 000). In order to improve the accuracy and 
consistency of the resulting information, the collection of environmen-
tally relevant consumption and emission data is subject to a continu-
ous improvement process. This applies in particular to those items of 
information that are calculated using special algorithms. Furthermore, 
the values for December of the preceding year may include some esti-
mated data if, for example, they are based on bills from power suppli-
ers or waste disposal providers which were not yet available at the time 
of compilation. In the next data collection round, this estimated data 
will be replaced with the finalized figures for December.
In line with corporate monitoring of our environmental strategy, the 
reported time series are related back to the 2010 baseline. The current 
reporting year and the preceding year complete the reporting period.
Overall, environmental data is collected from the Group’s production 
sites.
As in the Volkswagen Group’s Annual Report, data in the “Car and light 
commercial vehicles” category is reported for 2010, 2016 and 2017. 
Data for the brands Scania AB, MAN SE, Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. 
and VW Kraftwerk GmbH is reported in the “Other divisions” category; 
the respective proportions are shown separately in the graphs. Unless 
otherwise indicated, all the Group’s production sites, together with the 
power stations and boiler plants operated by Volkswagen AG in Wolfs-
burg, Kassel and Hanover in Germany, are included in both categories.
The data covers 113 of the Group’s 120 production sites. No data is 
available for Scania’s seven Regional Product Centers. These correspond 
to approx. 0.1% of the workforce at the production sites, hence have no 
relevant influence on the Group’s KPIs.
The Volkswagen Group is essentially an automotive manufacturer  
which produces cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles and buses. MAN SE does, however, 
also manufacture marine engines and power station components. In 
view of this product diversity, our overall environmental impact can-
not simply be expressed in terms of the volume of vehicles produced. 
Consequently, relative indicators are only shown for the “Car and light 
commercial vehicles” category. The number of vehicles produced in 
2017 totaled 10,667,549 cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as 
207,451 heavy-duty commercial vehicles.
The changing production volumes and associated fluctuations in 
capacity utilization levels at our various locations are reflected in 
changes in the absolute values of many indicators. However, in-
creased efficiency did result in improvements in the specific values  
of a number of indicators.
Weather conditions have an appreciable but uncontrollable impact on 
the consumption of resources. This relates primarily to space heating 
demand for both production and non-production areas, since the an-
nual average temperatures impact the direct consumption of energy 
sources, as well as the amount of energy purchased from third parties.
The specific values are also influenced by a range of factors. On the 
one hand, absolute consumption or emission levels may change, while 
on the other, rising or falling production volumes at the individual 
production sites also influence the indicators.

Appendix  |  SUppLeMenTARY indiCATORS
In fiscal year 2017, the Volkswagen Group – including our Chinese 
joint-venture companies but excluding trainees – employed 634,396 
people on average (+2.4%). In Germany, an average of 284,734 employ-
ees were working under contract in 2017; at 44.9% (45.2%), their share 
of the total workforce fell slightly below the previous year’s level. 
As at 31 December 2017, the number of active employees in the 
Volkswagen Group rose by 2.3% to 615,081. Another 8,004 employ-
ees were in the passive phase of semi-retirement and 19,207 young 
people were on training or apprenticeship programs. At the end of 
the year under review, the Volkswagen Group had 642,292 employees 
(+2.5%). The production-related buildup, further hiring of skilled 
workers in Germany and abroad, and an increase in the number of 
employees working at our new plants in Mexico, China and Poland 
were offset by the departure of around 9,800 personnel as a result  
of the partial sale of PGA Group SAS. The number of employees in 
Germany came to 287,480 (+2.1%); employees abroad numbered 
354,812 (+2.8%).

The moderate use of temporary work represents an essential 
flexibility instrument for Volkswagen. The principles of our 
Charter on Temporary Work serve to ensure appropriate condi-
tions of employment and remuneration for temporary external 
personnel and the standardized use of temporary work as an 
instrument across the Volkswagen Group. Volkswagen does not 
use external personnel to replace its own employees. Contracts 
for work and services are an essential instrument for meeting 
special personnel requirements (such as specific knowledge). 
The use of contracts for work and services is a normal proce-
dure. Volkswagen concludes such contracts for example with 
companies from the trades who are engaged in building work 
at the factories, with companies who supply, maintain and re-
pair plant and equipment, with cleaning firms, as well as with 
iT and development companies in order to access their specific 
knowledge. Volkswagen attaches great importance to ensuring 
that the Group's high social standards are integrated into its 
supplier management. We take reports of possible violations 
seriously and follow them up. if violations are determined, we 
ensure they do not recur.

The selection and recruitment of new employees is undertaken 
in line with their qualifications and suitability. Age is not a 
consideration in this process. Another control metric is the 
 recruitment of women. When recruiting university graduates 
we take our lead from the proportion of women graduates 
on the degree courses relevant for Volkswagen. As an average 
across all such courses this gives us a recruitment target of 
30% of female graduates. As a matter of principle, Volkswagen 
also supports the employment and qualification of local 
 people, both at existing locations and when establishing 
new ones.

Vocational education and training to the highest standards 
form a vital basis for the specialist knowledge and skills of our 
employees and thus also for the top quality of our products 
and the long-term commercial success of the Volkswagen 
Group. The specific qualification requirements of each individu-
al employee are derived from the competency requirements 
of the respective Berufsfamilie (professional family) and are 
identified at almost all of the Group's brands and companies 
at least once a year through the individual employee appraisal 
or qualification appraisal. The focus here is above all on the 
specialist content, the appropriate form of communicating this 
content and, in particular, the marked integration of theory 
and practice.

There is enormous potential within the diversity of the

top employer in the automotive sector, we want to make use 
of this potential by explicitly advancing women, improving 
the scope for combining work and family, and making full use 
of the cultural diversity that exists within the Group. in our 
experience a breakdown by minority group membership is not 
a relevant indicator.

discriminatory way; sanctions range from a formal warning 
through relocation to dismissal. if an employee feels he or 
she is being discriminated against, the Company not only 
meets the statutory provisions for reporting a grievance, but 
also provides the individual concerned with access to trained

Appendix  |  RATinGS And indiCeS
Because analysts and investors view corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) and sustainability as key indicators of forward-thinking corpo-
rate governance, their recommendations and decisions are increas-
ingly based on factors that include companies’ CSR and sustainability 
profiles. They look to sustainability ratings in particular to evaluate 
a company’s performance in terms of environmental compatibility, 
social responsibility and economy. Achieving top marks in these rat-
ings not only sends a clear signal to stakeholders, but also helps make 
a company more attractive as an employer and boosts the motivation 
of its employees.
STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
Before the emissions issue, Volkswagen held leading positions in 
sustainability rankings and indices such as the Dow Jones Sustain-
ability Indices, the CDP Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustainalytics and 
oekom research. Now, however, Volkswagen has been downgraded or 
removed from these ratings. 
In terms of customer satisfaction with their products, Audi and 
Porsche are leaders in the core European markets when compared 
with other Group brands and with their competitors. The other 
brands in the Group also score higher than competing brands. In 
terms of customer satisfaction with dealers, all Group brands achieve 
figures at or above the level of the competition. The Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars brand has maintained a high level of customer loyalty 
in its core European markets for several years in a row. However, the 
emissions issue had a negative impact on brand image, brand trust, 
and customer satisfaction with products compared with 2015. The 
loyalty of Audi, Porsche and ŠKODA customers has kept these brands 
in the upper rankings in comparison with competitors for a number 
of years. 
 
detailed information on the Volkswagen Group’s awards can be found in  
the more detailed Sustainability sections of our brands and regions.
PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION
Volkswagen Group wins fleet awards in the UK: five Golds in the Fleet 
News Award 2017; Audi UK named “Fleet Manufacturer of the year”. 
(At the presentation of the Fleet News Award 2017 by UK trade journal 
Fleet News, the Volkswagen Group succeeded in taking five first places. 
The best fleet models in the UK in 2016 were evaluated in a total of 
12 automobile categories. This year’s Fleet News Award was present-
ed in London for the twenty-ninth time. The jury, made up of fleet 
customers, Fleet News editors and representatives of associations and 
carmakers, assessed the vehicles’ quality, maintenance costs (including 
residual values) and CO2 emissions. 
The evening’s overall winner was the Audi brand, with three first places. 
In the “Best Compact Premium Car” category, the jury put the A3 in 
first place, while the A4 took first place in the “Best Premium Car” class. 
Being voted “Fleet Manufacturer of the year” was the evening’s icing on 
the cake for the Audi brand. The ŠKODA brand won another first place 
for the Group with the Superb in the “Best Upper Medium Car” category, 
as did the SEAT Ateca in the “Best Mid-Size SUV” class.).
At the WAVE Trophy 2017 event in Switzerland, the new e-Golf won a 
double victory. The world’s biggest e-mobile rally was held in Switzer-
land in June. It lasted eight days and covered around 1,600 kilometers. 
Leading the rest of the pack were two e-Golfs, which eventually finished 
first and second – clearly demonstrating that e-mobility is suitable for 
everyday use and also makes for a great driving experience. The natural 
gas-powered VW Caddy 1.4 TGI took the trophy in the 5-seater van 
class.
Further successes were achieved in the VCS Environmental ranking 
published in March 2017. In the subcompact class, the VW eco up!, 
Škoda Citigo and Seat Mii, all equipped with the 1.0 natural-gas engine, 
took first place with equal points, to become the test winners in 2017. 
In the compact (small family) class, the Audi A3 Sportback TFSI g-tron 
took first place just ahead of the VW Golf TGI; again, both run on 
natural gas.

As part of optimizing the entire value chain in the most holistic way, 
we aim to minimize the environmental impact of our vehicles by work-
ing closely with our suppliers. This is why Volkswagen joined the CDP 
Supply Chain Program (SCP) back in 2015. In addition, we seek to stay 
in direct contact with our suppliers by organizing targeted workshops 
in which we jointly discuss and develop innovative approaches to the 
environmental optimization of components and processes.
In 2016, we used the CDP SCP to send out a questionnaire to 119 sup-
pliers. We received comprehensive responses from 83% of them – 13% 
more than the average response rate in the SCP.
This year, the CDP evaluated the “Ability” of the 3,300 participating 
companies to make contact with their suppliers. On a scale from A to 
D, Volkswagen achieved an A- ranking, versus an average rating of C-. 
The ranking was based on an analysis of the answers to the question-
naire. 
 
detailed information on the Volkswagen Group’s awards can be found in  
the more detailed Sustainability sections of our brands and regions.
 
Through our involvement in national and international industry and 
sector associations, we continue to work with other automotive man-
ufacturers to create shared communication platforms with the aim of 
driving forward sustainability in the supply chain.
PEOPLE AND RESPONSIBILITY
Once a year, Volkswagen honors its highest-achieving trainees across 
the Group with the “Best Apprentice Award”. In 2017, ten young wom-
en and 36 young men from a total of 43 Group locations received this 
award for their outstanding performance and technical expertise.
detailed information on the Volkswagen Group’s awards can be found in the 
more detailed Sustainability sections of our brands and regions.

Appendix  |  independenT pRACTiTiOneRS RepORT
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined 
separate non-financial report pursuant to §§ (Articles) 289b Abs. 
(paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB] (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German 
Commercial Code”) of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, (hereinafter the 
“Company”) for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 
which comprises the sections marked with a grey background in the 
Group Sustainability Report 2017 of the Company (hereinafter the 
“Non-financial Report”). 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315b 
and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the principles 
stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the “GRI-Criteria”).
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the 
selection and application of appropriate methods of non-financial 
reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to 
individual non-financial disclosures which are reasonable in the 
circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible 
for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable 
the preparation of a Non-financial Report that is free from material 
misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
OF THE AUDIT FIRM
We have complied with the German professional provisions re-
garding independence as well as other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and pro-
fessional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German 
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für 
Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well  
as the Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der  
Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW):  
Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW Qualitätssiche-
rungs standard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der 
¹  PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German 
version of the separate non-financial report and issued an independent assurance report in 
German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent 
assurance report.
Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QS 1) – and accordingly maintains 
a comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
PRACTITIONER´S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 
Non-financial Report based on the assurance engagement we have 
performed. 
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on 
external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the 
Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard 
requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow 
us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s Non-financial 
Report for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 has 
not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b 
and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the relevant GRI-
Criteria. 
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are  
less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. 
The assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s 
judgment. 
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed 
amongst others the following assurance procedures and further 
activities:
 §
 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability 
organization, of the stakeholder engagement and of the 
conduction of the materiality analysis
 §
 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Non-
financial Report regarding the preparation process, the internal 
control system relating to this process and selected disclosures

ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
Based on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evidence 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the Company’s Non-financial Report for the period from 
1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 has not been prepared, in all 
material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction 
with 289c to 289e HGB and the relevant GRI-Criteria.
INTENDED USE OF THE ASSURANCE REPORT
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with

Ladies and gentlemen,
On December 12, 2015, the Paris Climate Agreement was approved, in which 196 countries 
have undertaken to keep global warming to below two degrees C. The Volkswagen Group feels 
committed to sharing this joint responsibility for our planet. Environmental and climate 
 protection are guiding principles of our actions.
On the road to emission-free mobility, we are putting all our weight behind the electric car. 
From today’s perspective, this is the best and, compared to other drive technologies, most 
 efficient choice for reducing CO₂ in transport. By 2025, we will put 50 new electric models on 
the road. Every fourth car in our range will then be an electric car. For this alone, we will in-
vest around €30 billion over the next four years.
Our striving for clean mobility will change the face of our factories. Zwickau, Emden and 
Hanover will be turned into pure-play electric car plants. Together, they will form Europe’s 
largest e-production network. In China, too, the conversion of the Anting and Foshan plants 
is in full swing. Production of electric cars will start in North America in 2022.
The Volkswagen I.D., which will be launched soon, will be the first vehicle with a CO₂-neutral 
supply chain and production. It will be the foundation of our electric offensive, in the first 
step involving around 15 million cars on the basis of our new MEB electric platform. In addi-
tion, we are discussing a Group-internal CO₂ levy on power, heating energy and fuel. In this 
way, we would not only provide incentives for an improved ecological footprint, but also free 
up funds for important energy initiatives and projects.
This type of ecology-based corporate governance is uncharted territory for us. Yet it under-
scores how seriously we take our responsibility for people and the natural environment. It is, 
however, equally true that, to ensure the success of the electric car and to cut CO₂ emissions 
permanently, there has to be a clear political roadmap – especially for expanding the charg-
ing infrastructure and for dealing with regulation.
In its first interim report, Volkswagen’s Sustainability Council appreciated the results of our 
work achieved to date and made suggestions on the development of the Group. Experts pro-
viding input from the outside – this also reflects the new self-image of Volkswagen. Through 
our “Together4Integrity” change program, we want to continue to drive cultural change and 
elevate our culture, integrity, compliance and risk management initiatives to an equal level 
with product quality and financial success.

F O R E W O R D
We have taken on a considerable challenge – there is no doubt about it. This Sustainability 
 Report 2018 will provide insights into our endeavors. It follows the guidelines of the Global 
Reporting Initiative, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Na-
tions. It also represents our Communication on Progress under the United Nations Global 
Compact and serves as our Nonfinancial Declaration under the German CSR Directive Imple-
mentation Act.
We look forward to receiving your suggestions and feedback!

THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP
With 12 brands, the Volkswagen Group – based in Wolfsburg, Ger-
many – is one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and 
the largest in Europe. In 2018, the Group – including Chinese joint 
ventures – delivered a total of 10,834,012 cars and commercial vehi-
cles to customers. 
OUTLINE OF THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
Volkswagen AG is the parent company of the Volkswagen Group. It 
develops vehicles and components for the Group’s brands, but also 
produces and sells vehicles – in particular passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles – under the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands. In its function as parent 
company, Volkswagen AG holds direct or indirect interests in AUDI 
AG, SEAT S.A., ŠKODA AUTO a.s., Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Scania 
AB, MAN SE, Volkswagen Financial Services AG, Volkswagen Bank 
GmbH and a large number of other companies in Germany and 
abroad. More detailed disclosures are contained in the list of 
shareholdings in accordance with sections 285 and 313 of the Han-
delsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code), which can be 
 accessed at www.volkswagenag.com/ir and is part of the annual fi-
nancial statements.
Volkswagen AG is a vertically integrated energy company within 
the meaning of section 3 para. 38 of the Energiewirtschaftsgesetz 
(EnWG – German Energy Industry Act) and is consequently 
 subject to the provisions of the EnWG. In the electricity sector, 
Volkswagen AG is involved in electricity generation, sales and 
 distribution, together with a subsidiary.
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management is the body ultimately 
 responsible for managing the Group. The Supervisory Board 
 appoints, monitors and advises the Board of Management, and is 
 directly consulted on decisions of fundamental significance for 
the Company.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups in 
the automotive industry. The Company’s business activities com-
prise the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All brands in 
the Automotive Division – with the exception of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands – are 
independent legal entities.
The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Commer-
cial Vehicles and Power Engineering Business Areas. The 
Volks wagen Group’s passenger car brands are mostly consolidated 
in the Passenger Cars Business Area. Activities focus on the devel-
opment of vehicles and engines, the production and sale of passen-
ger cars, and the genuine parts business. The product portfolio 
 extends from fuel-efficient small cars through to luxury vehicles 
in the premium segment, and also includes motorcycles, and will 
successively be supplemented by mobility services.
The Commercial Vehicles Business Area focuses above all on the de-
velopment, production and sale of light commercial vehicles, 
trucks and buses under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Sca-
nia and MAN brands, supported by our original parts business and 
related services. The collaboration between the MAN and Scania 
commercial vehicle brands is coordinated within the TRATON 
GROUP. The commercial vehicles portfolio ranges from pick-ups 
to heavy trucks and buses.
The Power Engineering Business Area manages business activities 
involving large-bore diesel engines, turbomachinery, special gear 
units, propulsion components and testing systems.
The activities of the Financial Services Division comprise dealer 
and customer financing, vehicle leasing, banking and insurance 
 activities as well as fleet management and mobility offerings.
With its brands, the Volkswagen Group has a presence in all rele-
vant markets around the world, with Western Europe, China, the 
USA, Brazil and Mexico currently representing its key sales 
markets. 
Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group are managed by the 
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management in accordance with the 
Volkswagen AG Articles of Association and the rules of procedure 
for Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management issued by the Supervi-
sory Board.

T H E  V O L K S WA G E N  G R O U P
To further enhance the Group’s leadership and management mod-
el, the Volkswagen Group introduced an additional internal opera-
tional structure in spring 2018. Volkswagen is confident that this 
will allow better use of existing expertise and economies of scale, 
boost synergy effects more systematically and accelerate decision 
making. 
In addition to the Finance & IT, Human Resources and Integrity 
and Legal Affairs divisions, the Volkswagen Group collaborates 
across six operational units and the China region. The six opera-
tional units are the “Volume” brand group, the “Premium” brand 
group, the “Sport & Luxury” brand group, the “Truck & Bus” brand 
group, the Components & Procurement business and the Finan-
cial Services business. The “Volume” brand group comprises the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, SEAT, ŠKODA and Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles brands. The “Premium” brand group includes 
the Audi, Lamborghini and Ducati brands. The “Sport & Luxury” 
brand group comprises the Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti brands. 
The “Truck & Bus” brand group is the umbrella for the Scania and 
MAN brands. The Components & Procurement business intends 
to act as one central unit, which spans across brands and supports 
them. The Financial Services business has been combined into a 
single unit.

123 locations in which passenger cars, commercial vehicles and 
motorcycles as well as powertrains and components are 
manufactured.
With 71 locations, Europe remains our most important production 
region for vehicles and components. There are 28 sites in Germany 
alone. The Asia-Pacific region has 34 locations. We have five loca-
tions in North America and nine in South America. The Group op-
erates four locations in Africa.
Despite difficult economic conditions, the Group – including our 
Chinese joint ventures – delivered a total of 10,834,012 cars 
and commercial vehicles in 2018. The Group was able to maintain 
its strong competitive position in the reporting period thanks to 
a wide range of attractive and environmentally friendly vehicles. 
Further details of the Group’s development, holdings and changes 
affecting production locations or activities can be found in our 
2018 Annual Report.

THE VOLKSWAGEN VALUE CHAIN
Year for year, the Volkswagen Group invests more in research and development than any other automotive 
company in the world, laying the foundations for new models and innovative concepts with which to master the 
challenges of the future: digitalization, networking and electric mobility (e-mobility). 
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
PROCUREMENT
Every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, components and other goods. A sus-
tainable supply chain and environmentally compatible transportation play key roles in our responsible and compre-
hensive championing of human rights, environmental protection and the battle against corruption.
MARKETING & SALES
The Volkswagen Group markets its vehicles in 153 countries. Around the world, comfort and safety are considered 
the key customer requirements. We continuously reduce our models’ fuel consumption and offer alternative mobil-
ity services.
PRODUCTION
Every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of 44,000 vehicles globally. Efficient production 
ranks alongside employee health and safety as one of our core goals. New concepts combine training with work 
experience, thus preparing employees for the future.
AFTER-SALES & FINANCIAL SERVICES
Our service provision includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality advice and maintenance, 
managing our original parts business, and providing innovative vehicle-related financial services. Driver training 
courses in fuel-efficient driving play an effective part in cutting fuel consumption and thus CO₂ emissions.
RECYCLING
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ impact on the environment and conserving resources. 
This is not just about recycling vehicles at the end of their useful life; recycling starts at the new-vehicle develop-
ment stage, during which we pay close attention to the recyclability of the required materials, the use of high-qual-
ity recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants. At the same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, for 
instance the treatment and disposal of service fluids and high-wear components.

GOALS AND STRATEGIES
We aim to achieve lasting success in tomorrow’s world of mobility 
by evolving into a global leader in the provision of sustainable 
 mobility. This is the reason we have anchored the future program 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 in the Group.
With the TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 future program, which was 
announced in 2016, we are aiming to make the Volkswagen Group 
more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented and sus-
tainable, and more systematically geared to generating profitable 
growth. The program creates the framework and lays the corner-
stones for us to achieve our vision of being one of the world’s lead-
ing providers of sustainable mobility.
Setting our sights on 2025 shows that we are willing to think and 
act long-term, looking forward to the future. The term “TOGETHER” 
describes the collective mindset within the Volkswagen Group, 
which will be even more important for our sustainable success go-
ing forward. Our intention with the new Group strategy is for 
everyone in the Volkswagen Group to join us in producing exciting 
vehicles and forward-looking, tailor-made mobility solutions that 
will continue to inspire our customers, meeting their diverse needs 
with a portfolio of strong brands. Every day, we actively assume 
and exercise responsibility in relation to the environment, society 
and safety, and we wish to be a role model in these areas. Integrity, 
reliability, quality and passion thus form the basis for our work. In 
this way, we will aim for technological leadership in the industry, 
ensure our competitive profitability and want to be an excellent, 
reliable and secure employer at the same time.
The Code of Collaboration formulated as part of the future program 
is the foundation on which the Group strategy rests. This Code 
 describes how collaboration is to take place within the Group and 
 between individuals in their day-to-day work. Its core values are en-
capsulated in the terms “genuine”, “straightforward”, “open-mind-
ed”, “as equals” and “united”. 
TOGETHER – STRATEGY 2025 
FUTURE PROGRAM
THE FOUR BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR PROGRAM FOR THE 
FUTURE: TOGETHER – STRATEGY 2025 
Our Group strategy comprises a raft of far-reaching strategic deci-
sions and specific initiatives essentially aimed at safeguarding the 
Group’s long-term future and generating profitable growth. It is 
composed of four building blocks which cover strategic Group ini-
tiatives. We regularly review the progress of these initiatives so as 
to analyze the significance, suitability and target achievement of 
the measures defined. This enables us to adjust the Group initia-
tives in a targeted way to the dynamic transformation within our 
Company. 
The first of these building blocks is the transformation of the core 
automotive business. Developing, building and selling vehicles will 
remain essential for the Volkswagen Group going forward. Howev-
er, there will be far-reaching and lasting changes to this business in 
the future. That is the reason why we are comprehensively restruc-
turing our core business to face this new era of mobility. 
The second key building block in our Group strategy is establishing 
a new mobility solutions business. In this business, we are devel-
oping innovative and efficient, attractive yet profitable mobility 
 services that are tailored to customer requirements with the goal 
of being one of the leading providers in this growth market in the 
future.
With the third key building block, we are intensifying our tradi-
tionally excellent innovative strength and placing it on an even 
broader footing. This is necessary both for the transformation of 
our core business and for the establishment of the new mobility 
solutions business. To this end, we are pushing ahead with the 
 digital transformation in all parts of the Company. 
Becoming one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable mo-
bility calls for substantial capital expenditure. This will be financed 
in particular through efficiency gains along the entire value 
chain – from product development and procurement through to 
production and distribution as well as in the central supporting ar-
eas. Additional funds for future investments can also be generated 
by optimizing the existing portfolio of brands and equity invest-
ments. Through the fourth key building block of the Group strategy 
we will safeguard the financing of the Volkswagen Group and place 
it on a solid basis.
GROUP STRATEGY GOALS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
The strategic initiatives describe how we intend to achieve our 
 vision of being one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable 
mobility. For this purpose, we have defined four target dimen-
sions – excited customers, excellent employer, role model for the 
environment, safety and integrity, and competitive profitability – 
which are designed to help us grow sustainably.

BUILDING BLOCKS AND STRATEGIC GROUP INITIATIVES 
Although these target dimensions apply throughout the Group, the 
strategic KPIs which we will use to measure our future progress in 
implementing our Group strategy will differ according to business 
model. After all, the business model for our passenger car-produc-
ing brands is different from that for trucks and buses and also from 
that of our Power Engineering Business Area and our services 
business.
In the following, we describe the Group’s strategic goals attached to 
these target dimensions.
The definitions of the strategic KPIs for the target dimension of 
competitive profitability have been standardized and established 
across the Group. As the new Group strategy has yet to be specified 
in detail, the content of some strategic KPIs in the other target di-
mensions is still being determined. The relevance of the KPIs is re-
viewed at Group level and their focus continuously monitored and 
adjusted as necessary. We report on the defined nonfinancial stra-
tegic KPIs in the “Corporate Governance Report” and “Sustainable 
Value Enhancement” sections of the 2018 Annual Report. 
 
  Annual Report > Corporate Governance Report, Sustainable 
Value Enhancement
Target Dimension: Excited Customers
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our custom-
ers and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to exceed our 
customers’ expectations, generating maximum benefit for them. 
That calls not only for the best products, the most efficient solu-
tions and the best service, but also for flawless quality and an out-
standing image. We want to excite our existing customers, win 
over new ones and retain their loyalty in the long term – because 
only loyal and faithful customers will recommend us to others.
The strategic KPIs consist of the conquest rate and KPIs pertaining 
to loyalty, customer satisfaction and quality.
Target Dimension: Excellent Employer
Skilled and dedicated employees are one of the keys to sustainable 
success. We wish to promote their satisfaction and motivation by 
means of equal opportunities, an attractive and modern working 
environment, and a forward-looking organization of work. Exem-
plary leadership and corporate culture form the foundation for 
this, enabling us to retain our core workforce and attract new 
talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension cover internal employer 
attractiveness determined by means of the opinion survey, exter-
nal employer attractiveness, an external employer ranking as well 
as a KPI pertaining to cross-brand exchange and rotation and the 
diversity index.
Target Dimension:  
Role Model for Environment, Safety and Integrity
Every day, we at the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise re-
sponsibility in relation to the environment, safety and society. This 
is reflected in our thoughts and actions and in all our decisions in 
equal measure.
We pay particular attention to the resources used and emissions 
generated by our product portfolio as well as our locations and

plants. Our goal is to continuously reduce our carbon footprint 
and lower our pollutant emissions. Through our innovations and 
outstanding quality, we aim for maximum product safety. 
The most important principles in this process include compliance 
with laws and regulations, the establishment of secure processes, 
and dealing openly with mistakes so that they can be avoided or 
rectified in the future. In terms of integrity, Volkswagen aims to 
 become a role model for a modern, transparent and successful 
enterprise.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension include the decarboni-
zation index, KPIs pertaining to emissions figures as well as to 
compliance, integrity and a culture of dealing openly with 
mistakes. 
Target Dimension: Competitive Profitability
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations 
as regards interest payments and debt repayments. As equity hold-
ers, they expect appropriate dividends and a long-term increase in 
the value of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth 
and strengthening our competitiveness, thus keeping the 
Volks wagen Group on a firm footing and ensuring it remains an 
 attractive investment option.
The goals we have set ourselves are operational excellence in all 
business processes and becoming the benchmark for the entire 
industry.
The strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen 
Group figures.

STRENGTHENING INTEGRITY 
AND COMPLIANCE 
16
STRATEGIC APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT 
We believe that only with lasting, dependable integrity and compli-
ant behavior will our Company gain and strengthen the trust of its 
staff, customers, shareholders, business partners and the general 
public. In the past, we have lost credibility and thus damaged the 
reputation of our Company. We deeply regret this and have taken 
radical action as a result of these developments. Our aim is to be-
come a role model when it comes to integrity and compliance. This 
way, we want to win new trust and to maintain our integrity as a 
scandal-free company in the future.
Acting with integrity is an established part of our Group TOGETHER – 
Strategy 2025 – and is thus on par with the quality of our products, 
our financial KPIs and the satisfaction of our customers. By imple-
menting our ambitious integrity program and the Code of Con-
duct, which applies throughout the Group, we have set important 
markers for the future.
INTEGRITY: THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ACTIONS 
For us, acting with integrity means doing the right thing in a pro-
fessional context on the basis of our own convictions. This means 
complying with our Group Principles and the ethical principles es-
tablished therein and behaving correctly in accordance with rules. 
This also includes the steadfastness needed to adhere to these prin-
ciples – regardless of economic and social pressure.
In our opinion, basing correct conduct on rules and regulations 
alone is not enough. Instead, it requires the strength to do the right 
thing even if no one is looking. Integrity is an attitude which, in 
gray areas, in the absence of explicit rules or in the event of con-
flicting goals, is an inner compass for proper conduct. Integrity is 
the maxim for our actions and complements compliance, which 
ensures that all processes and decisions within our Group comply 
with the relevant rules. Together, they shape our corporate culture, 
where the spoken and unspoken rules and values relating to our 
daily work are combined. 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE 
In periods of upheaval, there is of course a greater need for clear 
rules. If, however, people come to understand integrity better and 
thinking and acting with integrity every day becomes a matter of 
course, internal rules and guidelines can be reduced and steps can 
be taken to eliminate bureaucracy. Integrity sets the inner direc-
tion, while compliance defines the safeguards, provides guidance 
by specifying rules, and offers a secure basis for all employees to 
act under their own responsibility.
We would like to ensure that our employees not only know and fol-
low rules and guidelines, but can also act with integrity in the 
workplace. At the same time, everyone should be aware that specif-
ic values and rules of conduct that are generally accepted in every-
day life also apply in a professional context. This affects every indi-
vidual – from an apprentice to the Chairman of the Board of 
Management. 
OBJECTIVE AND CONTROLLING OF MEASURES
The Integrity and Legal Affairs Board of Management business ar-
ea, which was established in 2016, is responsible for integrity. Our 
Group thus has the organizational framework required for central 
integrity management. The business area, headed by Hiltrud D. 
Werner, is responsible for planning, preparing and implementing

is also responsible for reinforcing a culture of integrity within the 
Company. 
With its independent expertise and its recommendations, the 
Volkswagen Group’s Sustainability Council supports our efforts to 
encourage integrity.

 Goals and Strategies
INTEGRITY PROGRAM UNTIL 2020
Since 2016, we have been implementing the integrated integrity 
program, which, with its information campaigns, dialog opportu-
nities and initiatives, is aimed at all employees. The program has 
three key objectives:
understanding integrity – exemplifying integrity – demonstrating 
integrity
The integrity program is subdivided into six action areas which 
were shaped by the following activities in 2018:
1. Strategy and Measuring Success
Naturally, we will also measure how far we have come as regards in-
tegrity. To this end, we have developed an integrity index in 2018.
Not only do we want to know where we are making progress, we al-
so want to identify what action still needs to be taken. The integrity 
index will be launched as a pilot project at Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars and Audi in Germany in 2019. 
2. Dialog and Communication 
The focus was on communicating and ensuring the permanent 
 visibility of the issue of integrity through focused involvement of 
employees. Examples include the “Your Decision” campaign and 
the dialog tour, where Hiltrud D. Werner as the Director of Integrity 
and Legal Affairs seeks personal discussions with employees re-
garding the integrity-related challenges encountered in day-to-day 
work. Since it began in 2017, the dialog bus tour has stopped off 
more than 12 times at locations including the Volkswagen plants in 
Wolfsburg, Braunschweig and Hanover and at Audi in Ingolstadt. 
3. Ambassador Program 
When it comes to localizing and solving problems, the role of the 
some 200 voluntary integrity ambassadors should be highlighted. 
They serve as interfaces between business areas and integrity man-
agement and ensure that the issue of integrity becomes embedded 
deep within the structures of the Company.
4. Engagement Program
Managers have a special responsibility when it comes to change 
processes. As role models, they are among the biggest factors influ-
encing employee conduct. Their commitment towards integrity 
and compliance is an effective way of creating a culture of open 
discussion and reducing misconduct. After the Volkswagen Con-
vention with over 7,000 managers in 2017, similar cross-brand 
events with an international focus took place in 2018, for example 
in Brazil, in Mexico and at AUDI AG. In total, more than 13,000 
managers around the world have already found out about integrity, 
held discussions and shared their knowledge on the subject. 
For foremen and team spokespersons in production, a series of 
around 70 integrity workshops began in October 2018. The aim of 
the series of events is to highlight the importance that integrity 
plays in production every day and to highlight specific ways of 
handling various situations. The integrity workshops will continue 
in 2019. 
5. Processes and Instruments 
For us, making integrity an inherent part of the Group’s established 
structures and management processes is essential. One key area 
is HR – here, integrity is already integrated into 25 processes. From 
2019, integrity will be part of all new employment contracts and 
the work regulations which apply within the Volkswagen Group. 
Training and presentation documents aimed at specific target 
groups will be used to provide information for new and existing 
employees and ensure that they have the competence they need. 
6. International Rollout
Following the pilot phase in Wolfsburg, we have taken steps to 
 extend the integrity program to brands and selected companies, 
 regions and sites. We have used a wide range of formats for this 
purpose: from ramp-up weeks, conventions and dialog events to 
workshops. In the 2018 reporting period, activities were focused 
on the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Austria.
18
THE SIX ACTION AREAS OF THE INTEGRITY PROGRAM
TOGETHER4INTEGRITY – ALL INITIATIVES UNDER ONE UMBRELLA
In April 2018, the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG 
launched an umbrella program known as Together4Integrity (T4I) 
in order to establish excellence in integrity and compliance 
throughout the Group – in all brands, regions and companies and 
in relation to processes, structures, attitudes and conduct. T4I fol-
lows the five principles of the internationally recognized Ethics & 
Compliance Initiative (ECI). The principles relate to strategy, risk 
management, taking on responsibility and a culture of integrity 
and discussion. They are specified as a target level within the Group 
and are operationalized through T4I. 
With the T4I program, we as a Group would like to become a role 
model for a successful, well-run, honest and transparent company.
A uniform, consistent rollout has begun in all Group companies. 
The focus was on events in Germany, China, Spain, the USA, Austria 
and Slovakia, while the activities during the reporting period fo-
cused on ramp-up weeks and workshops. The rollout takes place in 
accordance with a set time plan, prioritized according to size and 
risk profile. The Board Member for Integrity and Legal Affairs and 
the Board Member for Human Resources are responsible for T4I. 
The other members of the Group Board of Management also take 
on roles as sponsors and ensure that T4I is implemented within 
their areas of responsibility.
As a dynamic and agile program, T4I is designed to undergo im-
provements on a continuous basis. A T4I toolbox has been devel-
oped. Best practices are regularly added to it, and it is made avail-
able to the Group companies for specific adaptation. 
KEY ROLE FOR CORPORATE CULTURE 
The corporate culture describes the values, rules and paradigms 
which shape the decisions, actions and conduct of our Company’s 
employees. Integrity is a key part of our corporate culture and an 
important success factor when it comes to achieving our TOGETH-
ER – Strategy 2025 goals.
The Volkswagen Group Principles are the basis for our corporate 
culture. These are:
• We take on responsibility for the environment and society.
• We are honest and speak up when something is wrong.
• We break new ground.
• We live diversity.
• We are proud of the work we do.

• WE not me.
• We keep our word.
As part of our cultural shift with a focus on integrity, we have de-
rived conduct anchors from the Group Principles and Company 
values. They formulate these principles as guidelines and provide 
guidance for employees in their day-to-day work: 
We act with integrity by
• representing our standpoint boldly and sincerely in the interests 
of the Company and standing up for our own convictions,
• discussing critical procedures, instructions and actions as well 
as deviations from rules and process weaknesses openly and con-
tributing constructively to dealing with them,
• acting reliably and in a binding manner,
• recognizing risks within our own area of responsibility which 
could jeopardize the success of a project or the Company and/or 
the health of people, making these transparent and initiating 
changes and
• making decisions in the interests of the Company taking into 
 account their effects outside the Company.
With the initiatives bundled together under the T4I umbrella, we 
continue to pursue the goal of creating a corporate culture where 
ethical decisions are the norm and people express their reserva-
tions as a matter of course. 
COMPLIANT BEHAVIOR 
Compliance with national and international laws and regulations, 
internal rules and voluntary commitments is among our Compa-
ny’s guiding principles as well as ensuring compliant behavior in 
a lasting manner. We are striving to strengthen the trust of our 
 customers, our business partners and stakeholders in our Group 
through fair treatment. Compliant behavior is the basis for this 
and must be a matter of course for all Group employees. One of our 
Company’s main tasks at the present time is to further enhance 
awareness of this.
OUR GROUP’S COMPLIANCE ORGANIZATION 
Our Group’s compliance organization supports and advises the 
Group and brand companies with an effective, risk-based, Group-
wide compliance management system, helping them to conduct 
their business activities in accordance with the rules and to consis-
tently adhere to relevant laws and internal regulations. Our global 
compliance organization is headed by the Group Chief Compliance 
Officer, who reports directly to the Director of Integrity and Legal 
Affairs and the Audit Committee of the Volkswagen AG Supervi-
sory Board. Compliance officers and their employees support the 
Group and brand companies in fulfilling their responsibility for 
compliance in the operating business. They help management in 
the different companies to identify, assess, manage and monitor 
compliance risks and to take suitable action to counter these risks. 
Additional centers of competence are responsible for the overall 
 direction of compliance work and develop compliance instruments 
and compliance program components with which the companies 
can implement the compliance requirements themselves across 
the Group. Additional resources allocated in the reporting period 
gave a significant boost to the Group-wide compliance 
organization.
The heads of the centers of competence report to the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer on disciplinary and functional matters. The 
compliance officers of the brand companies and the head of the re-
gional compliance office for China report to the Group Chief Com-
pliance Officer on functional matters. Communication between 
the Group and brand compliance managers and networking take 
place through regular meetings and conferences.  
The Group Compliance Committee – a committee on a top manage-
ment level chaired by the Director of Integrity and Legal Affairs – 
ensures that compliance and integrity standards are developed, ap-
plied and communicated in a standardized manner across 
divisions and brands. Our compliance management system is 
aligned with national and international laws and standards. The fo-
cus of our compliance organization is on preventing corruption, 
breaches of trust, embezzlement, fraud and money laundering and 
thereby on reducing the risk of unlawful actions.  
The aim of our whistleblower system is to protect our company and 
employees from harm using firm principles and a clearly governed, 
transparent and fair process. Experience with violations of laws 
and regulations helps us to enhance our compliance management 
and prevent similar incidents in future. The basis of compliance 
work within the Volkswagen Group is a systematic process of risk 
identification and reporting in accordance with the IDW standard 
AsS 980. 
CODE OF CONDUCT AND GUIDELINES PROVIDE GUIDANCE 
The Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct is the key instrument for 
strengthening employees’ awareness of correct behavior and find-
ing the right contact persons in cases of doubt. The Code of Conduct 
was revised in 2017 and was established throughout the Group. The 
framework is available to all employees on the intranet and to third 
parties on the Internet at any time. 
20
The Code of Conduct is also integrated into operating processes. For 
example, employment contracts for employees of Volkswagen AG 
include a reference to the Code of Conduct and the obligation to 
comply with it. In addition, compliance with the Code of Conduct 
remained part of our employees’ annual reviews in the reporting 
period and was thus taken into account when calculating their 
 variable, performance-related remuneration.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, there are various Group policies 
and guidelines regarding specific compliance issues. Organization-
al instructions also apply on dealing with gifts and invitations as 
well as on making donations. 
WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM FOR POSSIBLE BREACHES OF RULES
The Company has had a system for reporting any breaches of the 
law or rules since 2006. This system is optimized on an ongoing ba-
sis. Among other things, a central investigative office has been set 
up in the Compliance department. It is responsible for coordinating 
the whistleblower system within the Volkswagen Group and for 
processing information concerning Volkswagen AG and its subsidi-
aries – with the exception of AUDI AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG and 
TRATON AG. These companies have separate investigative offices 
for themselves and their subsidiaries.
Information on misconduct can be submitted in any of the major 
languages used by the Group and is treated confidentially. The 
people providing the information will be protected and need not 
fear any sanctions from the Company for their actions. They can 
decide for themselves whether they wish to give their names. 
For this reason, a specially protected online reporting channel 
(io@volks wagen.de) was set up in 2017, via which information can 
be sent to the investigative office anonymously. We continue to 
 rely on established channels such as the ombudsman system too. 
This system can be used to confidentially report any suspicions – 
in one of 11 different languages – to two independent lawyers ap-
pointed by the Group. The ombudspersons and the whistleblower 
system can be used by anyone – employees and people outside the 
Company.
In addition to the existing reporting channels, it has also been 
 possible to report potential breaches of rules via a 24/7 telephone 
hotline since August 2018. By calling the relevant number 
(+800 444 46300), employees, business partners and customers 
 anywhere in the world can provide information round the clock, 
365 days a year. A caller who calls the global telephone number will 
speak to a specially trained person, who can include an interpreter 
in the call if necessary. In addition, a revised Group policy was 
passed in 2018. This has further improved the whistleblower sys-
tem by providing extra communication options. The whistleblower 
system was also strengthened significantly by adding more staff. 
A total of 2,920 reports were registered throughout the Group in 
2018.  All substantiated reports have been, or will be, investigated, 
and any misconduct penalized.

ENCOURAGING TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION
The Code of Conduct is a key component of compliance training. 
The training is completed by anyone from directors to individual 
employees. Face-to-face and web-based or online training is used. 
Following a risk-based approach, mandatory compliance training 
is provided for specific target groups. In addition to traditional lec-
tures and online tutorials, case studies, role-playing games and 
other interactive formats form part of the training provided to 
employees and managers. Employees can also use special e-mail 
addresses to solicit advice on compliance issues.
All internal channels are used to communicate regulations and 
other compliance-related content – with a focus on further devel-
oping the whistleblower system over the course of the reporting 
period. Online communication takes place mainly via employees’ 
own posts on the Volkswagen intranet and on the internal, Group-
wide communications platform “Group Connect”. There are also

articles, interviews and other publications in cross-brand and spe-
cific divisions’ media. At the same time, compliance-related issues 
are publicized at various employee information events and compa-
ny meetings held at a number of locations. Providing information 
concerning the whistleblower system formed part of a cross-site 
event regarding corporate culture.

STRATEGIC APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT 
As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, our Group 
bears a special social responsibility. We wish to put our creative 
powers to good use for the benefit of people and the environment. 
We have thus developed a sustainable style of company manage-
ment and put in place the necessary management structures. For 
our Group, sustainability means simultaneously striving for eco-
nomic, social and environmental goals in a way that gives them 
equal priority. The TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 future program pla-
ces sustainable growth at the heart of our strategic target dimen-
sions: we want to be an excellent employer and a role model for the 
environment, safety and integrity, to excite customers and to en-
sure that we achieve competitive profitability. Our corporate citi-
zenship activities also support us in this endeavor.
 
 Worldwide Social Engagement
A particular challenge when implementing our strategic goals on 
all levels of the value chain is the complexity of our Company, with 
its 12 brands, more than 664,000 employees and 123 production 
sites. At the same time, our Group is undergoing a comprehensive 
transformation, especially as a result of the transition to e-mobili-
ty, digitalization and new mobility services. We have not yet fin-
ished dealing with the consequences of the diesel crisis. It remains 
our duty to ensure compliance on a permanent basis and to estab-
lish and deepen a culture of integrity throughout the Group. 
 
 Strengthening Integrity and Compliance
Climate protection is the greatest global challenge affecting all 
three sustainability dimensions (triple bottom line). Through effi-
cient combustion drives and Roadmap E, it is our aim to continu-
ously improve the climate footprint of our vehicles. We are also 
confronted with a range of conflicting goals and sustainability-re-
lated challenges resulting from our business model. The consis-
tently strong desire for individual mobility, the growing consumer 
markets in emerging and developing countries and the high de-
mand for our SUVs potentially go against our approaches to con-
serve resources and protect the environment. Although electric 
vehicles have clear environmental advantages over conventional 
vehicles with internal combustion engines during the usage phase, 
energy consumption in the supply chain is higher and there are 
unanswered questions, for example when it comes to battery 
recycling.
In an environmental context, we face challenges in Germany, pri-
marily as a result of the threat to air quality in town and city 
centers and driving bans owing to excessive levels of nitrogen ox-
ide in a number of cities. We have already entered into a responsi-
ble and objective dialog with the local authorities concerned. This 
includes cooperation when analyzing and selecting the most effi-
cient improvement measures. As digitalized mobility concepts and 
autonomous vehicles become more widespread in the future, new 
requirements as regards data protection will apply too. We must 
thus work closely with the authorities and associations as well as 
other market players to ensure that these requirements are met.
 
 Shaping Mobility with a View to the Future
We also want to live up to our responsibility through our business 
relationships on a global level. The localization strategies at our 
production sites around the world are generating increasingly com-
plex supplier structures. For this reason, we feel particularly 
obliged to ensure sustainability in the value chain. We deal with 
existing risks associated with resource extraction and in upstream 
value stages, for example conflict minerals. Our business partners 
are expected in particular to comply with high ethical, social and 
ecological standards. At the same time, we observe the growing 
regulatory requirements resulting from the National Action Plans 
to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights.
Our efforts to ensure sustainable supplier management and to 
 protect human rights are embedded in a comprehensive risk man-
agement system. Its aim is to ensure that key risks affecting the 
Volkswagen Group as well as the environment and society are 
managed and monitored appropriately and effectively. We would 
like to come up with the right answers to these challenges. It is im-
portant that we gain understanding of our stakeholders’ expecta-
tions and take these into account in our programs and measures.
The cornerstones of the TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 future pro-
gram, in conjunction with the 18 action areas from the materiality 
analysis, which was last conducted in 2017, are the basis for our 
current strategic focus. We have established a stakeholder manage-
ment system and involve various internal and external commit-
tees in the coordination of activities within the Group. Our actions 
are governed by our target program, which is based on the Group 
strategy and key sustainability issues.
A new edition of our comprehensive materiality analysis will be 
published in 2019 and will be shaped by these requirements. At the 
same time, this is the starting point for further integrating sustain-
ability into the corporate strategy and setting out the goals that 
we will pursue as part of an integrated sustainability program. We 
used 2018 as the year of transformation, thoroughly preparing this 
process and identifying top issues where urgent action needs to be 
taken.
With our strategic approach and sustainable processes, we have a 
solid foundation which we are constantly strengthening and devel-
oping. Our actions are determined by Group-wide voluntary com-
mitments and principles such as our sustainability model, our 
Group guidelines on sustainability and our corporate guidelines. 
We also follow the recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code.

EFFICIENT CONTROL THANKS TO SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
Our sustainability targets are derived from our future program 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 and the Group also follows departmen-
tal strategies which are linked to divisional targets.
Our sustainability model is based on the balance between econom-
ic, ecological and social interests, responsible action on a regional, 
national and global level as well as transparent communication 
and fair cooperation. The sustainability model is currently being 
revised with a view to including new topics and developments such 
as the technological shift towards e-mobility.
We have created a clear structure for coordinating our sustainabil-
ity activities that includes internal and external sustainability 
committees. The highest committee is the Group Board of Manage-
ment, which acts as the Sustainability Board at the same time. 
Members of the Group Sustainability Steering Committee regular-
ly update the Group Board of Management on issues of relevance 
to sustainability. The members of this steering committee include 
 executives from central Board of Management business areas and 
representatives of the Group Works Council and the brands. The 
Group Steering Committee defines specific strategic sustainability 
goals and position statements, identifies key action areas and ap-
proves the sustainability report.
Management indicators are used to monitor the extent to which 
these sustainability goals are being met. The Group Sustainability 
Office supports the Group Steering Committee. It performs a cen-
tral governance function for all sustainability-related activities 
within the Group and the brands. In 2018, the Group Sustainability 
Office functional area was assigned to the Group Strategy business 
area as part of a reorganization in order to further reinforce the 
link between sustainability, the strategic Company goals and its 
core business. It also oversees and coordinates sustainability rat-
ings, is responsible for producing the sustainability report and 
oversees the Sustainability Council and its work meetings. At the 
same time project teams work on current projects and issues such 
as reporting, stakeholder management and sustainability in sup-
plier relationships both on a departmental level and across 
divisions. 
The Group Sustainability Office works with the departments, 
brands and regions to further develop sustainability management 
within the Group, strengthens our expertise and coordinates joint 
initiatives. Communication takes place via regular meetings or 
during the annual Group Sustainability Summit. In 2018, the focus 
was on thematic workshops and the link between sustainability 
and the core business. 
We have institutionalized our stakeholder work through external 
committees. On a Group level, these are the Sustainability Council 
and the Stakeholder Panel.

CHECKING THE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 
During the reporting period, we successfully changed the sustaina-
bility reporting procedure to take into account the new Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI) Standards, which have been binding since 
July 2018. As of the 2017 reporting period, the same applies to the 
requirements of the CSR-RUG (German CSR Directive Implementa-
tion Act) regarding the disclosure of nonfinancial information. 
In order to identify key topics, we took into account external 
 studies, sector and media analyses, ratings, stakeholder surveys, 
 internal and external guidelines and codes, the Group-wide future 
program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 and the individual depart-
mental strategies. The Volkswagen Group’s 18 identified action 
 areas were assessed as regards their strategic importance for 
the strategy and their stakeholder relevance. We analyzed their 
 demands, expectations and attitudes in relation to the action areas 
as part of a desk research project which took into account more 
than 40 national and international stakeholder groups. This proce-
dure complements the activity of the established Stakeholder Panel 
and the Group companies’ stakeholder surveys. 
During this process, Volkswagen identified a total of 18 key topics 
in accordance with the CSR-RUG.
In 2018, we expanded the materiality process with the aim of view-
ing sustainability even more comprehensively from a company 
perspective, in the eyes of our stakeholders and as regards our eco-
logical, economic and social impact.
In 2017, the implications of CSR-RUG (for the disclosure of non-
financial information) and of the new GRI standards were dis-
cussed with representatives of the brands and corporate functions 
in four workshops, and subsequently reconciled with our divisional 
strategies.
When further developing our materiality analysis in the 2018 
 reporting period, we were guided to an even greater extent by fo-
cusing on the top topics revealed by global trends and the transfor-
mation of our business model. Many of these are already linked to 
the Group’s strategic goals. They include decarbonization in all val-
ue creation stages, digitalization, implementing the Roadmap E 
and Vision Zero for avoiding traffic accidents along with employee 
satisfaction and employer attractiveness.
To date, we have deliberately avoided prioritizing the action areas. 
Firstly, the importance of individual aspects can vary considerably 
depending on the region. Secondly, there are binding issues where 
we naturally comply with legal and social norms and stan dards. We 
take all economic, ecological and social aspects of our corporate re-
sponsibility equally seriously but in the future we will define key 
areas via our sustainability program.
As the details of the new Group strategy have not yet been final-
ized, we are still in the process of specifying the content of the key 
action areas and defining corresponding values, targets and indica-
tors. In 2019, we will implement our materiality analysis even 
deeper within the company and expand it with the help of an ex-
tensive IT-based data analysis.

STRATEGIC STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
Our stakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations who in-
fluence or are influenced by the way in which the Group reaches its 
corporate decisions and the implications of those decisions.
Our customers and our employees are the key stakeholders in our 
stakeholder network. Around this core, we have identified eight 
further stakeholder groups of equal importance on the basis of our 
annual stakeholder assessments.  
VOLKSWAGEN GROUP STAKEHOLDERS
GRI 102-40 
For us, stakeholder management means interacting with key stake-
holder groups systematically, continually and in line with our fu-
ture program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025. The aim of stakeholder 
management is to identify expectations systematically and to use 
the feedback from our stakeholders in order to reflect critically on 
strategic planning processes.
Given the size and complexity of the Group, we follow a multi-level 
approach. Our brands and regions have their own stakeholder ac-
tivities. This diversity is our strength. The Group’s task is to bring 
together all of these activities in an integrated stakeholder activity 
framework. This includes:
• Stakeholder activities on a Group level with specific committees, 
special formats and a focus on corporate stakeholders.
• Advising and coordinating the brands and regions and their ac-
tivities through sustainability management, e.g. with the help of 
internal workshops, regular video and telephone conferences 
and the annual Group Sustainability Summit.
• Harmonizing activities, e.g. with the help of our Sustainability 
Model, Stakeholder Guidelines and regular internal meetings to 
share best practices.
• Documenting activities, e.g. with the help of the sustainability 
report and the “Shift” magazine. In addition to this, we provide 
information regarding current projects on the Group website, in 
press releases and newsletters and on social media.
• Carrying out international studies and surveys among key 
 stakeholder groups.

ACTIVE AND INDEPENDENT: THE SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL 
In September 2016, the Volkswagen Group set up an international 
Sustainability Council to provide support regarding strategic sus-
tainability issues. The renowned experts from industry, politics, 
science and civil society act as independent advisors to the Group 
Board of Management, providing advice on sustainable mobility 
and environmental protection, social responsibility and integrity 
as well as the future of work and digitalization. The Council has 
provided the Board of Management with specific recommenda-
tions regarding technological, cultural and political change. The 
Sustainability Council also holds regular discussions with top 
management and employee representatives. In 2018, the Sustaina-
bility Council carried out the projects approved in 2017 and initiat-
ed three further initiatives: a project flanking the strategic focus of 
sustainability at Volkswagen, setting up a guest professorship for 
Open Labs and cultural change at the Einstein Center Digital Future 
in Berlin. We publish further detailed information regarding the 
members, the activities and the recommendations of the Council 
online. 
OPEN DISCUSSIONS IN THE STAKEHOLDER PANEL
In close partnership with the Institute for the Market, Environment 
and Society (imug), the Volkswagen Group has established a Stake-
holder Panel, which has overseen the Group sustainability activi-
ties for over 20 years. The aim is to critically question and continu-
ously improve sustainability management, Group initiatives and 
reporting processes. In the 2018 reporting period, we expanded the 
panel from 200 to 300 national and international stakeholders. In 
2019, we will step up discussions with our stakeholder groups by 
providing additional international dialog opportunities and thus 
further increase the importance of the Stakeholder Panel.

WIDE RANGE OF DIALOG AND INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES 
A detailed overview of our activity formats can be found on our 
website and in the extra information contained in this report. 
 
 www.volkswagenag.com/en/sustainability/reporting.html
The following three flagship projects in the 2018 reporting period 
exemplify our activities: 
• Stakeholder dialogs: We invite people to take part in dialog 
events at regular intervals. The stakeholder dialog is a format 
where we discuss current Group initiatives and sustainability 
 activities openly and critically. In the 2018 reporting period, 
MAN SE organized a stakeholder workshop in Munich and 
 AUDI AG a stakeholder dialog in Berlin. The next Group dialog 
is planned for spring 2019.
• Partnerships with NGOs: On a Group level, we have already 
worked successfully with a number of stakeholders for many 
years. In the 2018 reporting period, we continued our close 
 partnership with the German Red Cross and, in this context, 
 supported the Forecast-Based Financing project.
• Global Reputation Survey: Once a year, we question opinion lead-
ers from science, civil society, the media, politics and the finan-
cial market in Germany, the USA and China regarding their atti-
tudes towards and expectations of the Volkswagen Group. In the 
2018 reporting period, we doubled the number of cases for this 
study, internationalized project management, had the metho-
dology validated by external experts and publicized the results. 
The results indicate that stakeholder trust in Germany is still 
low. In the USA, there was a significant increase in trust, while in 
China the level of trust was high and stable. 
SUGGESTIONS FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND REACTIONS OF VOLKSWAGEN AG
Once a year, we produce a synthesis of our stakeholder feedback. In the 2018 reporting period, our stakeholders submitted the following 
recommendations to the Group via all committees and formats. These suggestions and remarks provide important stimuli for further 
 developing the Group.

RATINGS AND INDICES
Analysts and investors are referring increasingly to company sus-
tainability profiles when making their recommendations and deci-
sions. They draw primarily on sustainability ratings to evaluate a 
company’s environmental, social and governance performance. At 
the same time, sustainability ratings are instrumental in deter-
mining whether we are meeting our goal of being one of the world’s 
leading providers of sustainable mobility. Furthermore, they pro-
vide the basis for implementing internal measures.
After the diesel issue became public knowledge, the Volkswagen 
Group was downgraded significantly in the MSCI, RobecoSAM, Sus-
tainalytics, oekomISS, Vigeo Eiris, EcoVadis and RepRisk sustaina-
bility indices and consequently removed from sustainability indi-
ces such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good 
Index. In fiscal year 2018, Volkswagen continued to have a score of 
A– in the CDP and an A– rating in the WDP.
WORLDWIDE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT 
As a good corporate citizen, we would like to be a constant econom-
ic driver, contributing to local structural development and equal 
opportunities. We have always believed in the importance of recog-
nizing our social responsibilities towards our stakeholders. The 
main focus of our corporate social engagement activities is on sup-
porting local development, educational and community projects 
at many of our sites around the world. 
We select specific projects and develop them on our own or in part-
nership with local partner organizations and NGOs. We choose and 
carry out projects in accordance with our Group-wide guidelines: 
• The projects are in accordance with the Group Principles and 
 address a specific issue of local relevance or a global challenge.
• They are an expression of diversity within the Group and the 
 social environment in which the projects are carried out.
• The ideas for the projects come about in close consultation with 
local stakeholders, who are involved in carrying them out.
• Projects are managed locally under the responsibility of the 
units operating there.
FOCUS OF OUR ACTIVITIES
During the reporting period, we were involved in numerous proj-
ects to sustainably improve social structures. We also provide help 
on an ad-hoc basis in the event of natural disasters etc. For exam-
ple, we made a donation to the German Red Cross at the end of 2018 
to help people cope with the consequences of the volcanic eruption 
off the coast of Java and Sumatra. We give donations in cash and in 
kind to support activities and projects primarily devoted to re-
search and education, culture, sports and social causes. Donations 
may only be given to recognized non-profit organizations or ones 
specifically endorsed to receive donations. As a general rule, we 
do not make any donations to political parties, party-affiliated 
foundations or individual politicians. In the reporting period, 
Volks wagen AG made donations amounting to €33.8 million. On 
top of this, there are donations provided by our employees as so-
called workforce donations, which are used to support disadvan-
taged people who live near Volkswagen AG sites.
 
 www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting
One of our biggest projects is the strategic partnership with the 
German Red Cross. The focus here is on the Forecast-Based Financ-
ing project, which provides financial resources for humanitarian 
aid on the basis of detailed forecasts and risk analyses. The aim is to 
predict disasters, to minimize their effects as far as possible and 
thus prevent human suffering. Another part of the partnership is 
the “Future of public health protection and the emergency services 
in Germany”. We also encourage our employees to do voluntary 
work for local organizations in their spare time. Activities are bun-
dled and supported via the “Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt” office. 
INTEGRATION SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES
We continue to support refugees, focusing on three key areas: edu-
cation, professional integration and meetings. In the reporting pe-
riod, we focused on providing language courses lasting a number 
of months, subsidizing integration and employability courses and 
awarding study scholarships for 100 refugees. Through career guid-
ance and skills assessment measures, helping people to prepare for 
a future career by taking part in internships and sitting in on class-
es and providing entry qualifications and training opportunities, 
we have helped refugees in the area of professional integration. 
This work is complemented by various opportunities to meet other 
people and voluntary activities on the part of our employees. 
Acquiring language skills, developing expertise and obtaining pre-
liminary qualifications are the key to trainability and entering the 
labor market. Study scholarships, language courses, integration 
courses, obtaining entry qualifications, professional training and 
job offers are thus some of the key aspects of the support that we 
provide. By the end of 2018, we helped over 3,850 refugees to gain 
language and other preliminary qualifications.
Once the biggest challenges facing refugees have been overcome, 
the focus of many Group projects at sites in Germany is on helping 
people to learn German and to integrate into society. Our Group’s 
activities include providing a support program for refugees which, 
once successfully completed, leads to an apprenticeship as a ware-
house logistics specialist at Volkswagen.

GLOBAL SOCIAL BUSINESS SUMMIT:  
RECOGNIZING GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY
In November 2018, Volkswagen AG and the Autostadt in Wolfsburg 
hosted the ninth Global Social Business Summit, a meeting attend-
ed by 800 leading social business players from 55 countries. The 
meeting is the world’s leading forum for social business and en-
courages cooperation between the private sector, civil society, 
NGOs, the public sector, universities and students as well as social 
business companies.
The ideas of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus are an 
excellent example of social business. Yunus introduced a system 
offering microcredit to impoverished groups of people in Bangla-
desh and has been fighting poverty in his home country ever since. 
Under the slogan “New Civilization”, this year’s summit looked at 
the extent to which a value-based civilization can be established 
through social management. During workshops, keynotes, master 
class events, networking sessions and presentations, participants 
and interest groups met for talks. They discussed ideas and initia-
tives relating to the plastics industry and the circular economy, sol-
idarity, mobility, sport and nutrition. 
Volkswagen and the Autostadt contributed to the Global Social 
Business Summit not only as a partner and host, but also with a 
large team of socially committed employees. 
PREPARING THE YOUNG GENERATION FOR THE DIGITAL FUTURE
With the “KIDScraft” project, which took place at Wolfsburg Con-
gress Park in 2018, we invited 150 schoolchildren in years three to 
eight to learn about electronics, IT and robots in a fun way. The 
schoolchildren could try out their IT skills at a total of ten interac-
tive stations with the help of IT professionals, media educators, 
 designers and artists. A “CampTour” also took them through parts 
of Volkswagen IT as well as Research and Development. One station 
was the Smart Production Lab where robots are programmed.
The Volkswagen Group is also helping to educate young people for 
the digital future through the “xStarters” program. The online plat-
form aims to show young people aged between 14 and 19 years the 
digital world and the opportunities that it offers, helps them to 
build up digital skills and encourages them to come up with ideas 
for digital and social innovations. On October 15, 2018, an online 
competition was started via the xStarters app. The competition al-
lows young teams assisted by Volkswagen employees to develop 
and perfect their ideas and projects for digital social solutions. This 
format provides young people with a creative, experimental plat-
form for their own digital social ideas. In February 2019, the best 
ideas were presented to a distinguished jury and received awards.  
ACTIVE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
We work to protect human rights and encourage the use of interna-
tionally recognized principles and agreements as fundamental, 
generally valid rules on an ongoing basis. We reject all forms of 
child, forced or compulsory labor, modern slavery and human traf-
ficking. This applies to all processes within our Company and to 
our work with business partners along our entire value chain. 
 
 Responsible Supply Chain
The basis for cooperative work relations characterized by social 
harmony are the Volkswagen Group’s charters and declarations 
which were agreed with the European and Global Group Works 
Council. They offer our employees certainty as regards their em-
ployee and human rights. This includes their freedom of associa-
tion, their right to collective negotiations and equal pay, and the 
banning of discrimination at work.
In order to observe universal human rights, we follow various in-
ternational, European and national agreements. These include:
• the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
• the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
• the Core Labor Standards of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO),
• the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
 Fundamental Freedoms,
• the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and
• the German federal government’s National Action Plan for 
 Business and Human Rights. 
Our expectations of our employees and our Group-wide under-
standing of the observance of universal human rights are also set 
out in our Code of Conduct. The issue of human rights is covered in 
the section on “Our responsibilities as a member of society”. 
Our principles of conduct apply to all employees of all brands, com-
panies and hierarchy levels. Our Corporate Guidelines also lay 
down further principles.

AVOIDING RISKS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BREACHES
We aim to identify human rights risks at the earliest possible junc-
ture and act to continually minimize them. For this reason, we are 
constantly working towards establishing human rights due dili-
gence at all levels of our value chain. We pay particular attention to 
encouraging responsible supply chains for minerals from high-risk 
areas and areas of conflict. 
 
  Effective Controls through Risk Management; 
 Responsible  Supply Chain
 
 Annual Report > Report on Risks and Opportunities 
All employees receive training on the Code of Conduct that applies 
throughout the Volkswagen Group. We use real-life examples of po-
tential human rights violations, among other violations, to illus-
trate the individual issues and help employees put the Code of 
Conduct’s rules into practice. Moreover, since our procurement 
employees are a key interface with our business partners and thus 
our supply chain, awareness of sustainability issues and potential 
risks is raised among all new buyers and training is also provided. 
Our employees, business partners and other third parties can high-
light serious breaches of rules and rights on the part of employees 
via various channels in the Volkswagen Group’s whistleblower 
 system. A breach of human rights is a good example of a potential 
serious breach of this type. Suspected cases concerning our 
 supplier relationships can also be reported via sustainability@ 
vwgroupsupply.com.
 
  Annual Report > Compliance and Corporate Governance
Both employees and third parties can report possible breaches to 
the Volkswagen Group’s national and international employee rep-
resentative bodies, or to national and international trade union 
federations. 
RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN
We have more than 40,000 tier 1 suppliers worldwide, who employ 
more than five million people. At 41 locations in 21 countries, 
our procurement network ensures that our production facilities 
are supplied with materials of the requisite quality, in the required 
quantities, at competitive prices. The goods and services we pur-
chase around the world to manufacture our products are worth 
over €185 billion (including our Chinese joint ventures).
SUSTAINABILITY IN SUPPLIER RELATIONS CONCEPT 
IMPLEMENTED
We can only ensure that our sustainability standards are met if we 
work closely with our business partners. We work in accordance 
with the sustainability in supplier relationships concept, which is 
based on three pillars: requirements, qualification and monitoring. 
 
  https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/nachhaltigkeit/ 
documents/policy-intern/2016%20Code%20of%20Conduct%-
20for%20Business%20Partners%20DE-EN.pdf
This framework is used to define our requirements as regards sus-
tainability for our business partners. We use targeted monitoring 
instruments to ensure compliance, and organize training initia-
tives to steadily raise suppliers’ awareness of sustainability issues. 
In order to identify current developments and long-term challeng-
es in the individual countries, we encourage dialog between our 
brands and regions through the Sustainability Procurement Net-
work, in which more than 20 experts work together.
PRECISE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT
The Sustainability in Supplier Relations concept is based on the 
“Volkswagen Group requirements regarding sustainability in its re-
lationships with business partners (Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners)”. The latter embeds our expectations of our business 
partners’ conduct with respect to key environmental, social and 
compliance standards in our contractual agreements. We also call 
on our tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements down along the 
supply chain. Among other things, these requirements are based 
on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International 
Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Develop-
ment, and the conventions of the International Labour Organiza-
tion. The Code of Conduct for Business Partners was revised in the 
reporting period with a view to further increasing the sustainabili-
ty requirements imposed on suppliers. Various topic areas such as 
harassment, the integration of sustainability issues into processes 
and other topics such as occupational health and safety were ex-
panded. Since publication, suppliers have also been required to dis-
close high-risk supply chains on request and to share information 
regarding the origin of their materials with us. Through this, we 
want to make a substantial contribution towards meeting our due 
diligence obligations. In 2019, a guideline designed to provide sup-
pliers with practical tips for implementing the requirements will 
be added to the Code of Conduct.
In order to assess the sustainability-related risks on suppliers’ sites 
before potential suppliers are actually nominated, we use a country 
risk analysis system and other data. This analysis is based on 
third-party information and the results of in-house analyses. We 
 also subject all potential new business partners and suppliers to an 
integrity check (Business Partner Check). 
34
Before submitting a quotation, our suppliers must confirm that 
they acknowledge our sustainability requirements; this explicit ac-
knowledgment must be repeated after 12 months have elapsed if 
they wish to submit new quotations. These requirements are an in-
tegral part of our contracts with all suppliers to General Procure-
ment and with all suppliers of production materials. They apply to 
all goods and services purchased worldwide.
SUPPLIER MONITORING EXPANDED FURTHER
We ask our business partners to fill in the sustainability question-
naire in order to document the steps taken in selected areas. We 
have incorporated our sustainability questionnaire into the sec-
tor-wide self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) developed for use 
throughout the industry in a joint project with other automotive 
corporations involved in the DRIVE Sustainability Working Group 
organized by CSR Europe. By the end of the reporting year, over 
28,000 suppliers had submitted a sustainability self-assessment 
questionnaire to us. This covers around 92% of our total procure-
ment volume.
On the basis of the self-assessments, we identify ways to enhance 
sustainability performance, and then communicate the latter to 
our suppliers. In the reporting period, over 2,100 suppliers im-
proved their sustainability performance through taking appropri-
ate steps.
A certified environmental management system in accordance with 
ISO 14001 and/or EMAS is one of the ecological requirements our 
tier 1 suppliers have to meet. To date, 76% of our tier 1 suppliers 
have documented such a system. In addition, we recommend that 
our suppliers put in place a certified occupational health and safety 
management system that complies with OHSAS 18001, SA8000 
and/or AA1000.
Where selected business partners are identified as being at in-
creased risk of non-compliance with sustainability requirements, 
they are audited by an external specialist on-site. These audits cov-
er all our sustainability assessment criteria as well as interviews 
with employees of the selected suppliers. During the reporting pe-
riod, audits were carried out at 947 suppliers. 
What we refer to as “ad-hoc cases”, i.e. suspected breaches of the 
sustainability requirements which occur suddenly, represent a sig-
nificant proportion of our supplier assessment activity. These may 
be discovered, for example, during an audit on the supplier’s prem-
ises. In such a case, the ad-hoc expert team responsible coordinates 
a catalog of measures on behalf of the relevant brand or region 
and is supported by the Group ad-hoc expert team. If we determine 
that suppliers or sub-suppliers are failing to meet our sustainabili-
ty requirements, we ask them to provide a written statement based 
on a standardized report (6D Report). Based on the six points, our 
business partners can describe the situation and any remedial 
mea sures. Repeated on-site checks carried out by external service 
providers can help to determine whether the measures were car-
ried out in a satisfactory manner.
During the reporting period, Group Internal Audit agreed mea-
sures with suppliers in addition to 30 ad-hoc cases that were pro-
cessed by Procurement. This concerned suppliers where behavior 
contravening the rules or contracts was identified as a result of 
 information provided or audits carried out. In 2018, Group Internal 
Audit arranged for 44 measures to be carried out at suppliers.

Employees and external parties can also report potential breaches 
of rules on the part of our suppliers to the Volkswagen Group’s em-
ployee representatives or the trade union associations and use the 
Volkswagen Group’s whistleblower system. Potential breaches of 
rules can also be reported to sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com. 
This applies to possible breaches on the part of our tier 1 suppliers 
as well as sub-suppliers in the supply chain.
 
 Compliant Behavior
We are developing the sustainability requirements which apply to 
our suppliers all the time. After all, we are convinced that a sustain-
able supplier network guarantees long-term company success. For 
this reason, the Volkswagen Group will introduce a new, expanded 
compliance and sustainability rating for all business partners in 
2019. The aim is to ensure transparency as regards compliance with 
the Volkswagen Group’s standards along the entire supply chain.
EXERCISING DUE DILIGENCE
As part of our sustainable supplier management measures, we 
pay particular attention to protecting those groups of people who, 
along our supply chain, are at particularly high risk of human 
rights abuses. In this context, we formulate the due diligence re-
quirements for building responsible supply chains of minerals 
from conflict-affected and high-risk areas as an additional contrac-
tual requirement for our suppliers. 
Not only do we deal reactively with breaches of rules in our supply 
chain, we also work proactively in order to exercise due diligence. 
By doing so, we aim to meet the requirements of the OECD Due Dil-
igence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from 
Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. This contains guidelines for 
management approaches, for risk identification and prevention, for 
checking smelters and for communication and reporting instru-
ments. Our due diligence obligations are shown below using con-
flict minerals as an example.

Step 5
 Annual report to meet the due diligence requirements  
in the supply chain
We expect our suppliers to use their management systems to rule 
out the use of minerals from smelters affected by conflicts. Miner-
als are considered conflict minerals if non-governmental armed 
groups are supported directly or indirectly through their extrac-
tion, transportation, trade, handling, processing or export. In cases 
of suspected non-compliance, we also expect our suppliers to dis-
close the sources of materials that may have some connection with 
human rights violations such as child, forced or compulsory labor 
as well as any other forms of modern slavery or human trafficking. 
This also applies to labor conditions in the extraction of raw mate-
rials such as cobalt and mica.
In order to identify risks, increasing transparency is a matter of top 
priority for us. Upon request, suppliers and subcontractors must 
disclose to us the smelters or refineries from which they source the 
metals tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. In 2018, suppliers provid-
ed us with specific information on their supply chains that enabled 
us to identify 321 smelters of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. 
If we identify non-certified smelters in our supply chain, we take 
steps to certify these smelters. Non-compliant smelters identified 
in the reporting period must be replaced by compliant smelters.
We have launched similar activities for the sustainable sourcing of 
cobalt. We are in close contact with companies from the mine to 
our tier 1 suppliers. It is important that we share not only the same 
company goals, but also the same company values: transparency, 
compliance and sustainability must be observed and implemented 
by all potential partners. To date, our discussions with everyone in-
volved have been on an equal footing and with the aim of finding 
shared, constructive solutions.
In the 2018 reporting period, we also stepped up checks of smelters 
and mines, e.g. through on-site visits in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo.
We continue to publicize our activities and progress through 
press reports and the sustainability report. In the coming year, we 
will step up our activities in our supply chains. We will take further 
steps to better map out our supply chain and focus on other raw 
materials. We will not only identify risks, but also try to minimize 
them with various tools, such as certification.
36
SHAPING COOPERATION AND DISCUSSIONS  
ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
In our efforts to ensure the sustainable sourcing of raw materials 
and to prevent the use of conflict minerals, we work closely with 
 international initiatives and organizations. As part of our supplier 
management, we use the Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) and 
standardized reporting templates of the Responsible Minerals Ini-
tiative (RMI). With the help of data provided by RMI, we inform sup-
pliers in business relationships with non-compliant smelters and/
or refiners about alternative options for working with conflict-free 
smelters and/or refiners. 
Together with the RMI and the DRIVE Sustainability Working 
Group, we have produced a study on the sustainability risks in the 
raw materials sector entitled the “Material Change Report”. On this 
basis, we have prioritized the critical raw materials.
We would also like to test and implement innovative, interdisci-
plinary approaches in supplier management. Together with 
Zalando SE and other project partners, we organized a hackathon 
in 2018. This focused on the use of blockchain technology to track 
raw materials throughout the supply chain.
We also held workshops with mining companies from the copper 
and platinum industry in order to come up with joint plans and ap-
proaches for making improvements.
ENCOURAGING CO₂ REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
With fully and partly electrified vehicles, the CO₂ impact shifts 
away from the usage phase to the manufacturing phase, as a result 
of which the focus shifts to the supply chain. The Volkswagen 
Group thus uses green electricity at this stage of value creation. 
The use of electricity sourced from renewable energy sources with 
proof of origin is now a prerequisite when awarding contracts for 
the production of high-voltage battery cells. By actively taking part 
in the CDP supply chain program, we closely involve our suppliers 
in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 
value chain. 
In 2019, we will continue to focus on reducing CO₂ and identifying 
the main sources of emissions along the supply chain.
 
 Climate Protection through Decarbonization
DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR SUPPLIERS AND EMPLOYEES
We continually take steps to train our employees and raise their 
awareness of sustainability in the supply chain. For all Procure-
ment employees, this issue is an established part of the skills pro-
file. In 2018, more than 2,000 procurement staff worldwide were 
given training in this area. Our training measures are also geared 
to specific target groups. For example, buyers of components asso-
ciated with higher sustainability risks were given an intensive 
training program in a separate format. Since 2017, we have trained 
our procurement employees to deal with the special challenges 
found in battery supply chains. 
To facilitate ongoing supplier development, we make an e-learning 
module on sustainability available to all current suppliers, as well 
as to Volkswagen Group procurement staff, in the nine languages 
of the countries which have been defined as compliance risks. By 
the end of the reporting year, more than 31,000 suppliers – repre-
senting 74% of our procurement volume – had completed the 
e-learning module.
Alongside the e-learning format, we also conduct issue-specific 
 sustainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers 
at selected locations. During the reporting period, events were held 
in countries including Turkey, Germany, Mexico, Hungary, Thai-
land, China, Argentina and Brazil. In total, around 900 personnel 
employed by some 550 of our suppliers were given training on sus-
tainability issues at these events. 
EFFECTIVE CONTROLS THROUGH RISK MANAGEMENT
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with 
our business activities and taking a forward-thinking approach to 
managing them is crucial to our Company’s long-term success. A 
foresighted risk management process and effective internal control 
systems are therefore vitally important to us. Not only do we set 
high internal standards, we also insist that all our suppliers along 
our entire value chain comply with these standards.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM  
(RMS/ICS) 
A comprehensive risk management and internal control system 
(RMS/ICS) helps us to handle risks responsibly. It defines the prima-
ry principles and elements of our Group, forming the basis for the 
appropriate and effective management and control of material 
risks. This applies to risks with consequences for the Volkswagen 
Group and to risks for the environment and society.
37
S T R E N G T H E N I N G  S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  T H R O U G H O U T  T H E  G R O U P
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organi-
zations of the Treadway Commission). During the reporting period, 
a risk management approach which takes into account aspects of 
the internal control system was followed. 
Through a Group risk management policy, all business divisions 
and units are obliged to implement an RMS/ICS. The exact form of 
the RMS/ICS is up to the risk managers in the individual divisions 
and business units. The Group Risk Management function supports 
the divisions by providing necessary training and participating in 
conceptual development.
The Board of Management receives ad-hoc, quarterly and annual 
risk reports. 
Assessing the probability and extent of future events and develop-
ments is, by its nature, subject to uncertainty. We are therefore 
aware that even the best RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and 
even the best ICS can never completely prevent irregular or 
non-compliant actions. 
Another key element of our RMS/ICS is the three lines of defense 
model – a basic element required, among others, by the European 
Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). In line with 
this model, our RMS/ICS has three lines of defense that are de-
signed to protect us from the occurrence of material risks.
• The first line of defense comprises the risk management and in-
ternal control systems at the individual Group companies and 
 divisions. The RMS/ICS is an integral part of our Group’s organi-
zational structures and processes.
• The second line of defense is the Group Risk Management func-
tion, which sets standards for the RMS/ICS and coordinates the 
quarterly risk survey and annual governance, risk and compli-
ance (GRC) control process. It reports to the Group Board of Man-
agement on any material risks, which are defined in terms of 
quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria and given proba-
bility ratings.
• The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which carries 
out regular checks on the structure and implementation of the 
RMS as part of its independent audit activities.

BROAD SPECTRUM OF RISK ANALYSIS
The diesel issue both causes intrinsic risks for the Volkswagen 
Group and has an impact on existing risks.
Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general en-
vironmental risks and climate-change risks.
These include risks that could result from differing CO₂ and emis-
sions regulations. Extreme weather situations, storms or floods can 
cause failures of information and communication technology, sup-
plier failures resulting in production stoppages, or general produc-
tion downtime at one or more of our production facilities around 
the world. Our evaluation of the overall risk situation includes the 
potential impacts of natural disasters and resource shortages. Our 
risk assessment takes the form of a net analysis, i.e. taking account 
of any countermeasures initiated to minimize the risk.
Our Group risk management processes also take account of the 
risks associated with the six nonfinancial aspects:
• Environmental matters
• Employee matters
• Social matters
• Customer matters
• Respect for human rights
• Combating corruption and bribery
Key risks in the eyes of the Volkswagen Group including the risks 
relating to the six nonfinancial aspects which must be reported on 
are presented in the risks and opportunities report in the status re-
port. This also includes the risks resulting from the diesel issue 
which affect the nonfinancial aspects of environmental issues. 
Otherwise no other high-probability risks with potentially severe 
negative impacts on nonfinancial aspects were identified in fiscal 
year 2018.

STRATEGIC APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT 
The Volkswagen Group is actively evolving from an automotive 
manufacturer to a provider of sustainable mobility. We are bridg-
ing the gap between innovative vehicle technologies and futuristic 
mobility concepts which are geared to customers’ requirements 
but can also help to solve environmental and traffic problems in 
urban areas around the globe.
We aim to take on a world-leading role in the areas of e-mobility, 
autonomous driving, digitalization and new mobility services. 
This means not only opportunities for long-term business success, 
but also challenges and risks. As a result of the forthcoming trans-
formation, we are confronted with entirely new market players 
and competitive situations for which we need to be prepared. We 
also depend to a large extent on the development of widespread, 
high-performance infrastructures – something that we can only 
influence indirectly. At the same time, connected driving and digi-
talization rely on the exchanging of large quantities of data, but 
we must also comply with legislation governing personal data pro-
tection. 
We also have to deal with conflicting goals: in spite of innovative 
mobility concepts, many people still want to own their own car, es-
pecially in emerging and developing countries or in sparsely popu-
lated areas. Although we would like to cater for people’s desire for 
individual mobility, we must also take into account our use of nat-
ural resources and harmful emissions. 
FOCUSING ON THE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT
In order to achieve full transparency regarding the environmental 
impact of our vehicles and their use of resources, we look at their 
entire life cycle. We focus on CO₂ emissions and are committed to 
reducing these significantly as part of our decarbonization pro-
gram. Our analyses show that the usage phase of vehicles currently 
results in the largest quantities of emissions. As a result of the tran-
sition towards e-mobility, CO₂ emissions viewed over the life cycle 
will shift in principle from the usage phase towards production – 
with battery manufacture as a major source. We would like to begin 
here and regard climate-neutral production as one of the most im-
portant levers.
Vehicles in cities around the world also cause noise, traffic jams 
and air pollution. We believe that we have a particular responsibili-
ty here: we want to understand the effects of these problems on 
people, the environment and society even better given the com-
plexity of the interactions between vehicle technologies and mo-
bility solutions and assess these reliably. We are thus carrying out 
impact assessments based on real data, models and simulations in 
many areas or are supporting relevant initiatives. In this reporting 
period, the focus was on reducing noise, air pollution control and 
shared mobility. 
The diesel crisis has damaged our reputation and we are still feeling 
the consequences. In order to play an active role in finding solu-
tions, we have worked on a study looking at measures to reduce ni-
trogen oxide pollution in a number of German cities.
FUTURE STRATEGY FOR CLEAN VEHICLES AND CUSTOMER-
ORIENTED SERVICES 
We are addressing the aforementioned challenges ambitiously 
 because we are convinced that we can offer important answers and 
solutions in all action areas. Our aim is to be a leading innovator 
and technology provider and in turn to underpin our high level 
of customer satisfaction. We have embedded new mobility solu-
tions and digital services as core elements in our future program 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025. In order to achieve this, we will expand 
and improve our range of products and services while reducing 
the number of platforms. We are implementing the Roadmap E for 
all brands and would like to become the world’s number one in 
electric mobility. When developing our products, we focus on mini-
mizing consumption and using resources in the most efficient way 
possible. 
Through our MOIA offering, we develop and market our own mo-
bility solutions and are stepping up our partnerships with cities 
and existing traffic systems. With SEDRIC (SElf-DRIving Car), we 
have an innovative mobility concept based on autonomous vehi-
cles. SEDRIC is our cross-brand idea platform for sustainable, safe 
and comfortable mobility available to anyone.
The trust of our customers is particularly important for a suc-
cessful transformation to a provider of sustainable mobility. For 
our customers, we bundle all digital services and apps on the 
Volkswagen We service platform. They thus become part of an en-
tirely new mobility ecosystem which complements the Volkswagen 
experience on wheels and brings the digital world into customers’ 
own cars. The motto of our sales strategy is “Customer Delight”. 
This means achieving the highest level of customer satisfaction 
possible. 
In order to be able to measure and manage this, we collect data on 
two strategic indicators for the major passenger car-producing 
brands: loyalty rate and conquest rate. We also measure customer 
satisfaction for our truck business and our financial services.
As far as the quality and safety of our vehicles and mobility con-
cepts are concerned, we set the highest standards. “Vision Zero” 
serves as a target for preventing accidents or significantly reducing 
their consequences – something we aim to achieve through our 
technical measures.

INNOVATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES 
Our technological developments are very much geared to increas-
ing the efficiency and eco-friendliness of drivetrains and fuels with 
each new model generation. This applies to internal combustion 
engines, hybrid and plug-in hybrid drivetrains and even purely 
electric drivetrains and fuel cell systems. As part of the e-offensive, 
the further development of electric drivetrains is very much at the 
center of our work. Nevertheless, we retain our large and diverse 
drivetrain range, allowing the brands to react to the individual re-
quirements of markets and customers.
MODULAR ELECTRIC TOOLKIT TAKES ON A KEY ROLE 
Our modular toolkits allow us to use various drivetrains in combi-
nation and to install these flexibly on the production lines at our 
sites around the world. The Modular Electric Drive Toolkit (MEB) is 
the technological backbone of electric vehicles and is a unique sell-
ing point for the Volkswagen Group. It allows e-drivetrain compo-
nents, auxiliary systems and interior features to be linked together 
intelligently. It will make the manufacture of e-cars more efficient 
and less expensive in the long term. This will allow Volkswagen to 
focus production on e-mobility and to respond to the growing de-
mand for electric vehicles. 
The first model based on the new MEB is the Volkswagen I.D., which 
will be available from 2020. It will offer a range of up to 440 km for 
the price of a Golf diesel. E-cars will thus become affordable for mil-
lions of people. We will launch the I.D. as a 100 percent emission- 
neutral electric car – over the entire production process including 
battery cell manufacture.
ROADMAP E PAVES THE WAY FOR THE FUTURE
As part of our future program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, we are 
launching the Roadmap E, the biggest electrification offensive in 
the automotive industry. By 2025, we would like to be a world 
 leader for e-mobility and launch more than 80 electrified models, 
including some 50 all-electric vehicles and 30 plug-in hybrids. Ac-
cording to our forecasts, one in four new vehicles from our Group 
will feature a purely electric drivetrain by 2025. Depending on how 
the market develops, this could be as many as three million electric 
vehicles per year. 
By 2030, we would like to offer at least one electrically powered ver-
sion of each of the 300 or so passenger car models manufactured by 
the Group, across all brands and markets – battery-powered, as hy-
brid or mild hybrid vehicles. By doing so, we will be the first mobili-
ty group to set a deadline for the electrification of its vehicle fleet. 
With the Roadmap E, we will provide more than €20 billion for di-
rect investments in the industrialization of e-mobility by 2030.
In order to support our electric offensive, we have recruited SKI, 
CATL, LG Chem and Samsung as strategic battery cell suppliers for 
our most important markets and the first MEB models. We predict 
that the Volkswagen Group alone will require almost 150 gigawatt 
hours annually by 2023. At the moment, there are only capacities 
for 20 gigawatt hours in Europe. We are therefore looking at acquir-
ing a stake in a battery cell production company.
In September 2018, Audi began producing the e-tron at its Brussels 
plant in Belgium. To this end, the plant was completely converted 
within two years. This included a battery production facility where 
only cell modules are bought in. In 2018, Audi started mass produc-
tion of its own electric motors in Győr (Hungary). These motors are 
used for production in Brussels. 
 
  Further information on e-mobility can be found in  
the sustainability sections of our brands:

– Porsche | IONITY  
– Volkswagen Passenger Cars | I.D. Family 
– Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles | e-Crafter  
– MAN | eTrucks 
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE MUST BE DEVELOPED
If e-mobility is to achieve a breakthrough, there must be an accessi-
ble, available charging infrastructure geared to people’s needs as 
well as a customer-friendly charging procedure. Volkswagen AG is 
setting up its own charging and energy ecosystem based on car-re-
lated hardware and software and is focusing on all areas of use: at 
home, at work, in public areas and on major roads. 
The joint venture IONITY plays an important role here. Together 
with the BMW Group, Daimler AG and the Ford Motor Company, 
Volkswagen AG is working to establish a reliable network of quick 
charging facilities (350 kWh) along major European roads. By 2020, 
400 of them will be in operation. We are also working to promote 
the spread of e-mobility with mobile charging points. A pilot proj-
ect with quick charging points that work similar to a power bank, 
flexibly and independently of the mains network, began in Wolfs-
burg in 2018.
Generally speaking, all countries are working hard to develop the 
charging infrastructure to meet the growing needs of e-mobility 
users. In Germany, we worked with the VDA in 2018 to establish 
recommendations and requirements regarding the development of 
charging infrastructures to encourage e-mobility and took these 
into account in the discussion. These recommendations and re-
quirements focus on subsidy programs, charging convenience, 
construction measures, network integration and legal frameworks.
45
S H A P I N G  M O B I L I T Y  W I T H  A  V I E W  T O  T H E  F U T U R E
When it comes to developing the charging infrastructure, 
Volkswagen is taking steps too: all 4,000 official Volkswagen deal-
erships in Europe will be equipped with charging points. At the 
same time, Volkswagen will expand the network of charging points 
in staff car parks at its production sites from 1,000 to 5,000 by 2020. 
We are also working to offer electricity from renewable energy 
sources at our Company’s charging points wherever possible.
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WITH BRIDGING FUNCTION
On the road to sustainable mobility, we need an orderly change of 
systems which includes the internal combustion engine as a bridg-
ing technology. So that we can offer a broad product portfolio as 
economically as possible, we are reducing the variety of individual 
modules. In the case of our conventional combustion engines, for 
example, we will cut the number of variants within the Group by 
more than one third over the long term. 
We will increase the proportion of vehicles in our fleet which com-
ply with the requirements of the Euro 6 standard, which has been 
compulsory for newly registered vehicles since September 2015. 
In 2017, we launched the series production of the 96 kW 1.5 l TSI 
evo, an exceptionally fuel-efficient powertrain for our latest 
BlueMotion models. It has a special sailing function where the en-
gine is switched off while the vehicle is coasting. Together with 
 other technical innovations, this can improve fuel consumption 
by up to 1.0 l/100 km.
Every new diesel vehicle now has an SCR catalyst as standard, while 
the new petrol engines are all equipped with particulate filters. 
Since 2017, new measuring procedures for exhaust-gas emissions 
(including particulates and nitrogen oxides) and consumption 
(CO₂) have applied for new vehicle types in the EU. Consequently, 
each vehicle is assigned its own CO₂ value. WLTP allows the mea-
surement of CO₂ emissions for passenger cars and light commer-
cial vehicles in an internationally standardized manner and pro-
vides customers with more realistic information. The second 
introductory phase for the WLTP, which requires that all new vehi-
cles be checked in accordance with the new standard, began in 
2018. In addition to WLTP, measurements in accordance with the 
RDE testing procedure have been taken in Europe since September 
2017. RDE stands for “real driving emissions”. Unlike with WLTP, 
emissions are not measured on a test bench – they are measured in 
actual road traffic.
STUDY ON MEASURES TO COMBAT NITROGEN OXIDE POLLUTION
The fact that nitrogen oxide levels often exceed the limit values in 
German cities and the resulting discussion regarding the banning 
of diesel vehicles have prompted us to offer dialog regarding possi-
ble measures for specific cities and to step up partnerships with the 
cities affected. Our shared aim is to avoid the banning of certain 
vehicles and to achieve maximum transparency as regards the ef-
fects of the individual improvement measures in the local area.
Prompted by a VDA initiative, our Group including the Audi, Por-
sche, Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial 
 Vehicles brands is the only German automotive company to offer 
selected cities financing for complex model-based measure assess-
ments for air pollution control. The cities of Kiel, Heilbronn, Lud-
wigsburg and Hanover have accepted this offer. It allowed them to 
apply for the subsidies provided with sound arguments. 
The independent assessment of the measures was carried out by 
the PTV Group. The measures have also been integrated into the 
cities’ air pollution control plans. PTV is the world leader for inte-
grated traffic concepts on the basis of intelligent software solu-
tions, which are already in use in numerous cities around the 
world. The calculations were based on the nature of the urban in-
frastructure, traffic levels and vehicle fleets, existing emissions 
sources such as vehicles, industry or house fires, basic meteorologi-
cal and topographical conditions and the existing nitrogen oxide 
background pollution.
The cities involved selected the measures to be assessed on the 
 basis of their own development strategies. These also included 
mea sures from the 2017 diesel summit, e.g. software updates and 
 replacing vehicle fleets. Moving traffic to other areas and times, 
switching from individual transport to public transport or using 
bicycles and stabilizing traffic flow, for example through speed 
limits and alternative traffic light sequences, were also investigated. 
In spite of different basic conditions in each region, naturally re-
placing vehicle fleets was consistently identified as by far the most 
effective measure. In Germany, this means 3.5 million vehicles per 
year. Investing in clean drive technologies and high-quality fuels 
is thus the most important approach when it comes to achieving 
significantly better air quality. With our vehicle technology inno-
vations such as the E-Offensive, we have the right approaches to 
solve this problem. Measures to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution, 
which can occur in a highly localized manner, as quickly as possi-
ble in specific cities may also be necessary. 
We realize that air pollution in major cities and urban areas is a 
problem which is not confined to Germany. People in large urban 
areas around the world face much more serious health problems 
than we do here. We are thus active on a global level, for example 
in the WBCSD project “Transforming Urban Mobility” which, to-
gether with other players, is searching for solutions for clean cities.

REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND 
ENERGY SOURCES
In addition to e-mobility, we are focusing on allowing better use of 
environmentally friendly CO₂-reduced fuels in internal combus-
tion engines. The advantage here is that technological innovations 
could help to protect our climate and the environment, even in ex-
isting vehicles. By using compressed natural gas (CNG) for trans-
portation purposes, i.e. using natural gas or methane as a fuel, we 
offer customers in the passenger car and commercial vehicles sec-
tor a drive technology for sustainable mobility which is available 
immediately and affordable. CNG as a fuel produces up to 25% less 
CO₂ emissions than today’s petrol engines. Through the use of bio-
CNG or e-gas, CNG mobility will be virtually CO₂-neutral in the 
years ahead.
Methane as a liquid gas (liquefied natural gas, LNG) is an economi-
cal and clean alternative for trucks and buses in particular because 
its high energy density is ideal for long-distance applications. 
 However, the natural gas filling station network in most countries 
needs to be improved if this development is to be a success. 
Various research projects and testing procedures for CO₂-reduced 
regenerative fuels are under way at the Volkswagen Group and the 
brands. In the reporting period, the newly developed fuel R33 Blue 
Diesel was tested at the plant’s own filling station in Wolfsburg. 
 Regenerative fuel components – purified and chemically processed 
cooking fat – make up one third of the innovative fuel, allowing 
CO₂ savings of at least 20% compared to ordinary diesel in the 
energy balance, which includes fuel manufacture. R33 complies 
with the EU norm for diesel (EN590) and is compatible with all ex-
isting diesel vehicles. The fuel is now permanently available at the 
filling station and is used for the entire fleet of company cars. This 
solution is particularly attractive for big customers who, given the 
long ranges of their fleets, continue to rely on diesel vehicles, yet 
still want to achieve their environmental targets.
When it comes to making greater use of regenerative fuels in the 
future, we apply the same strict sustainability criteria as we do for 
other vehicle technologies used by us. When obtaining raw mate-
rials, we avoid competing with food production, conserve natural 
 resources and comply with social standards. 
Under Audi’s development leadership, we are also looking at hydro-
gen (H₂) as a fuel and are working constantly on fuel cell technolo-
gy where H₂ is converted into electrical energy in the vehicle. Long 
ranges and short refueling times make hydrogen an attractive fuel 
for e-mobility. This applies especially to larger vehicles where the 
weight advantages of a fuel cell vehicle make a real difference. 
Through operating test fleets, Audi has gained extensive practical 
experience with these drivetrains and will join forces in this area 
with partners such as Hyundai in the future. Along with further 
progress in the area of fuel cell technology, the regenerative pro-
duction of hydrogen and the development of a widespread, custom-
er-friendly infrastructure will be crucial to the market success of 
this form of drivetrain in the future.

MOBILITY CONCEPTS FOR A TRANSPORT REVOLUTION 
We are deliberately making futuristic mobility services a mainstay 
of our business model. We would like to offer our customers con-
nected, environmentally friendly services which can be used re-
gardless of whether they own their own vehicle, complement other 
modes of transport and use proven shared economy concepts. The  
focus here is on urban areas where there is considerable pressure to 
act owing to traffic jams, air pollution, noise and a lack of space.
VOLKSWAGEN WE AS A DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM
Via the Volkswagen We digital service platform, we are bundling 
more and more innovative mobility services and apps. This com-
plements the Volkswagen experience on wheels and brings the 
 digital world into cars. Volkswagen already offers the following 
 applications: “WePark”, the parking app with integrated billing, 
“WeDeliver”, the parcel delivery service in a luggage compartment, 
and “WeExperience” with personalized services and recommenda-
tions close to car parks. With “WeShare”, we are entering the world 
of car-sharing. 
The new service structures are also based on partnerships with 
 outside companies requiring joint data access. We take great care 
to make all processes transparent and lawful so that customers 
 always retain control of their own data.
In the future, the “Volkswagen We” ecosystem will be an important 
part of the Volkswagen Automotive Cloud, which links vehicles, a 
cloud-based platform and customer-oriented services provided by 
all brands. As a large industrial cloud, it will include all future mo-
bility services and other digital services from Volkswagen. In doing 
so, Volkswagen is pressing ahead with its digital transformation.
In 2018, Volkswagen and Microsoft established a strategic partner-
ship to develop the Volkswagen Automotive Cloud together. In the 
future, all IT and other services in vehicles from the core brands 
as well as the Group-wide cloud-based digital One Digital Platform 
(ODP) architecture will be based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud plat-
form and will use platform services such as Azure IoT Edge. 
As part of the partnership, Volkswagen will set up a new develop-
ment center for the Automotive Cloud in North America. In the 
47
S H A P I N G  M O B I L I T Y  W I T H  A  V I E W  T O  T H E  F U T U R E
long term, the solutions resulting from the strategic partnership 
will be rolled out at other Group brands and in all world regions. 
The Volkswagen Automotive Cloud will thus form the basis for all 
of the Group brands’ digital services and added value offerings. 
In addition to this partnership, we will also seek to work with inno-
vative IT start-ups that will assist us in further developing our ser-
vices and in optimizing the digital infrastructure of the 
 Volkswagen Group.
MOIA: SHARED USE OF TRANSPORT SERVICES
We would like to do our bit to solve urban transport problems. 
Through shared journeys, we ease the burden on traffic and the 
 environment. With MOIA, we offer bundled on-demand mobility 
services such as ride-sharing in Germany. Instead of using their 
own cars, people travel to their destination with other passengers 
all traveling in the same direction. 
With its ride-sharing service, MOIA complements existing public 
rail and bus routes in a practical, inexpensive manner and offers 
an attractive alternative to private cars. As an independent 
Volkswagen Group brand, the subsidiary develops and markets 
its own mobility services independently or in partnership with 
 cities and existing transport systems. 
After a test phase lasting several months, MOIA was launched in 
the Lower Saxony state capital of Hanover in 2018. Initially, 100 ve-
hicles will be available, but there are plans in place to have 250 on 
the street at a later stage. The service is available to all residents and 
can be booked via smartphone app. On average, the fee is between 
that of public transport and a taxi. By the end of 2020, at least 
50% of the pool will be made up of electric vehicles. The scheme is 
due to be launched in Hamburg in April 2019 with a fully electric 
vehicle fleet. Initially, MOIA will operate roughly 200 vehicles; by 
2022, 1,000 fully electric MOIA vehicles will be on Hamburg’s 
streets. 
NEW CAR-SHARING MODEL IN BIG CITIES ABOUT TO BE 
LAUNCHED
We are complementing the MOIA service with vehicle-on-demand 
services which are aimed at people in urban areas and are designed 
to introduce them to the benefits of e-mobility. Under the sub-
brand “WeShare”, the Volkswagen brand is introducing a compre-
hensive, purely electric car-sharing service in selected big cities. 
The first vehicle fleet will be launched in the German capital Berlin 
in 2019. “WeShare” is also the first service in Volkswagen’s new 
“We” ecosystem which is aimed at people who do not own cars. Af-
ter the launch in Berlin, “WeShare” will be introduced in other big 
German cities. From 2020, the scheme will also be extended to Eu-
ropean core markets and to selected cities in the USA and Canada. 
AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IS BECOMING REALITY 
Autonomous driving is the key issue in our transformation from 
an automotive manufacturer to a provider of sustainable mobility. 
A concept based on heavily used autonomous vehicles will not only 
require less space and energy – it will also be much safer. We would 
like to make automated driving accessible to everyone, everywhere.
With SEDRIC (SElf-DRIving Car), we have not only created an inno-
vative, integrated mobility concept for the urban traffic of the fu-
ture, we have also developed a totally new kind of concept car. It 
has an intuitive operating system where a push of a button, a voice 
command or a smartphone app is enough. The self-driving car will 
bring passengers to their destination comfortably, reliably and 
safely.

Since SEDRIC was first unveiled, significant progress has been 
made in developing the self-driving system as well as systems for 
environment recognition and traffic data analysis. SEDRIC will 
be a symbol for smart mobility solutions and is the Volkswagen 
Group’s contribution towards ridding cities of problems such as 
traffic jams, air pollution and accidents.
In 2018, a year after the world premiere of the SEDRIC, the 
 Volkswagen Group presented the latest version of its mobility 
 concept for fully automated driving: the SEDRIC School Bus. With 
this bus, the Company is underpinning the goal it set out in the 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 future program, namely becoming a 
global leader in the area of autonomous driving. 
In the future, we would like to expand this form of mobility and 
make it safer and thereby more accessible to older or disabled peo-
ple, for example. At the same time, we want to not only further 
 develop cars as a means of transport, but also establish them as a 
retreat or a place for working or entertainment. We would also like 
as many people as possible to share an autonomous car. 
In the years ahead, autonomous and connected driving will funda-
mentally change the growing road freight transport too. For exam-
ple, we are working with MAN and DB Schenker to test platooning, 
where electronically connected trucks travel close to each other in 
a convoy. This allows fuel savings of 10%, reduces emissions and 
eases the burden on drivers through the use of drive assistance and 
control systems. 
IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR SHARED MOBILITY CONCEPTS
In cities in particular, people’s mobility habits are changing and 
they are now more willing to use alternatives other than traveling 
individually in their own cars. We would like to gain an even better 
understanding of how new mobility concepts work and the com-
plex effects that they have. To this end, we are developing methods 
and expanding our own know-how. 
In the reporting period, the focus was on analyzing the effects 
of shared mobility concepts on cities. On the basis of mobility de-
mand and mobility service simulations, we compared the two 
shared mobility services which dominate at the moment – ride- 
hailing and ride-pooling. The ride-hailing concept is based on an 
app which is used to organize door-to-door rides. In contrast, ride- 
pooling intelligently bundles a number of people’s individual 
 journeys with similar routes in one vehicle. The people get in and 
out at virtual stations. This is similar to the MOIA service that 
Volkswagen has launched.
During the study, we assumed that there is considerable interac-
tion between users, providers and the urban transport infrastruc-
ture. Our initial results indicate that ride-hailing is better than 
ride- pooling for the journey time but is more likely to result in 
 additional driving and more traffic. Ride-pooling results in fewer 
empty runs and transports more people, which will probably 
 result in less driving and fewer car journeys. 
We will gradually use the impact assessment method on other mo-
bility concepts. At the moment, the focus is on commercial trans-
port, which accounts for around a third of inner-city journeys. We 
are looking at possible improvements, for example linking goods 
and passenger transport, improving last mile logistics, e.g. through 
more cargo bikes, and other micromobility services.
HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IN ALL BUSINESS AREAS
As part of our future program, we have developed a sales and mar-
keting strategy aimed at exciting customers on a whole new level 
under the slogan “Customer Delight”. We regard ourselves as an in-
novative and sustainable mobility provider for all commercial and 
private customers worldwide – with a unique product portfolio en-
compassing 12 successful brands and innovative financial services.
In the 2018 fiscal year, we achieved a milestone in our sales strategy 
TOGETHER – Strategy 2025: together with their sales partners and 
importers, our passenger car brands have agreed on a procedure for 
integrating innovative products and services into the sales net-
work. The priority is safe handling of customer data and the way in 
which this is processed for digital products and services or in con-
nection with vehicle sales. The legal requirements for handling cus-
tomer data have been tightened in many countries. At the same 
time, new Group vehicles that are permanently connected to the 
Internet are about to be launched. We are increasingly investing in 
distribution systems and processes with the goal of further digital-
izing and improving the individual customer experience in all dis-
tribution channels.
Optimal coverage of markets, customer segments and customer 
budgets are at the heart of a strategic Group initiative. To this end, 
we are establishing automobile-specific customer segmentation to 
steer the positioning of our brands. At the same time, we are exam-
ining global markets for potential revenue sources. This methodol-
ogy has already been established for Europe and China and in 2018 
was rolled out to further markets including the United States and 
Brazil. It will be continuously applied in the strategy and product 
process and regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary whenev-
er new market requirements arise.

The Volkswagen Group aims its sales activities at exciting its cus-
tomers. This is our top priority, as enthusiastic customers remain 
loyal to our brands and recommend our products and services to 
others. We value customer satisfaction with our products and ser-
vices and therefore our customers’ emotional connection to our 
brands. It is important for us to retain customers and win new 
ones. To measure our success in this area, we collect data on and 
analyze two strategic indicators for the major passenger car-pro-
ducing brands:
• Loyalty rate: proportion of customers of our passenger car 
brands who have bought another Group model. The loyalty of 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche and ŠKODA customers 
has kept these brands in the upper loyalty rankings in the core 
European markets in comparison with competitors for a number 
of years even though the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi 
brand have seen a slight decrease in the loyalty rate as a conse-
quence of the diesel issue. Compared to other manufacturer 
groups, the Volkswagen Group continues to hold a top spot in the 
core European markets in terms of loyalty, with a considerable 
margin over the competition.
• Conquest rate: newly acquired passenger car customers as a pro-
portion of all potential new customers. Here, too, the Volkswagen 
Group has a top ranking, primarily thanks to the good scores 
achieved by the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand.
In the core European markets, the downward trend in brand image 
and brand trust at the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand as a conse-
quence of the diesel issue did not continue in 2018. After the first 
signs of recovery had been seen in 2017, the figures continued to 
stabilize in the reporting period. Porsche remains in top position in 
the image ranking.
We also use a strategic indicator to measure the satisfaction of cus-
tomers with our products and services in the truck business:
• Customer satisfaction: in the markets relevant for the 
 Volkswagen Group, we aim to be one of the industry leaders in 
terms of the satisfaction rate for our commercial vehicle brands. 
To evaluate these criteria, we use customer satisfaction studies, 
which again delivered exceedingly positive satisfaction figures 
in line with our targets in the reporting period. 
In the financial services business, we use two strategic indicators:
• Customer satisfaction: a customer-oriented product range and 
the service focus of our staff make for satisfied customers. In the 
annual measurement, the two aspects are suitable indicators for 
the critical assessment as to whether we will achieve our target 
of 90% customer satisfaction in 2025. In 2018, we were within the 
expected range with a satisfaction rate of 82%. Our goal is to 
 satisfy our customers completely. For this we are developing cur-
rent measures at country level.
• Customer loyalty: trust in and loyalty to our services rely on 
 customer satisfaction with our product range and service. At 
cur rently 20%, the new contract rates that are regularly deter-
mined based on product sales to our customers – financing 
agreements and leases for purchases of new Volkswagen Group 
vehicles – are proof of customers’ trust in our financial services. 
With ambitious targets of 50% for 2025 we underscore the focus 
on fulfilling the needs of our customers.
STABLE BUSINESS WITH FLEET CUSTOMERS 
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet 
customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular. Our ex-
tensive product range enables us to satisfy their individual mobili-
ty needs from a single source. In the German passenger car market 
that declined as a whole by 0.2% in 2018, the share of fleet custom-
ers in total registrations fell to 13.6 (14.1)%. The Volkswagen Group’s 
share of this customer segment decreased to 44.0 (44.7)%. Outside 
Germany, the Group’s share of registrations by fleet customers in 
Europe remained stable at 25.2 (25.2)%. The upward trend until Au-
gust shows that fleet customers still have considerable confidence 
in the Group. The temporary limitation of the model range as a 
consequence of the changeover to the WLTP had a negative impact 
from September 2018 onwards.  
GLOBAL AFTER-SALES SERVICE FOR PASSENGER CARS 
AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLES
In addition to individual service, the timely provision of genuine 
parts is essential in ensuring passenger car customer satisfaction 
in After Sales. The genuine parts supplied by our passenger car 
brands and the expertise of the service centers represent the high-
est level of quality and ensure the safety and value retention of our 
customers’ vehicles. With our global after-sales network including 
more than 130 of our own warehouses, we ensure that almost all 
our authorized service facilities around the world can be supplied 
within 24 hours. We regard ourselves as a complete provider of all 
products and services relevant to customers in the after-sales busi-
ness. Together with our partners, we ensure the worldwide mobili-
ty of our customers. The partner businesses offer the entire portfo-
lio of services in all vehicle classes. We are continuously expanding 
our range of tailored services in order to improve convenience for 
our customers and increase customer satisfaction.
In the Digital After Sales project, we are modernizing processes 
and IT systems in After Sales. By adopting an approach that focuses 
product and service development squarely on both dealers and 
customers with their specific needs, we aim to reduce the time 
needed for administrative tasks at the dealers through automated, 
interrelated services and also stabilize existing IT systems and 
boost efficiency. Innovative digital after-sales will additionally im-
prove the customer experience.
Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also prides it-
self on products of the highest quality and on customer focus. Our 
range of trucks, buses and engines is complemented by services 
50
that guarantee fuel efficiency, reliability and good vehicle availabil-
ity. The workshop service and service contracts offer customers 
a high degree of certainty, in addition to a high level of quality. We 
are reducing servicing times and costs with a view to reducing ve-
hicles’ total operating costs and helping them retain their value. 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY
GROUP QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
The quality of our products and services plays a key role in main-
taining customer satisfaction. Customers will be particularly satis-
fied and loyal when their expectations of a product or service are 
met or even exceeded. Appeal, reliability and service determine 
quality as it is perceived by the customer throughout the entire 
product experience. Our objective is to positively surprise our cus-
tomers and fill them with enthusiasm in all areas, and thus to win 
them over with our outstanding quality. 
STRATEGY OF GROUP QUALITY MANAGEMENT
We embody outstanding quality and ensure dependable mobility 
for our customers worldwide – this is the strategic goal that guides 
the work of Group Quality Management. Group Quality Manage-
ment and the brands’ quality organizations play an active role at all 
stages of product emergence and testing, making an important 
contribution to successful product launches, high customer satis-
faction and low warranty and goodwill costs. 
In consultation with the brands, we developed the Group Quality 
Management strategy as part of our future program TOGETHER – 
Strategy 2025. Focal areas include digitalization, new technologies 
and business areas as well as uniform processes, methods and 
standards at all brands. 
The advancing digitalization is also a major challenge for the 
Volkswagen Group: an ever increasing number of digital products 
and services is being developed and brought to market. To continue 
to ensure our customary level of quality and safety amid this diver-
sity, we must adapt our quality measures accordingly. For example, 
the increased functional diversity and complexity of the driver as-
sistance systems, extending all the way to autonomous vehicles, 
means that the software is also growing in scope. We have there-
fore introduced the processes and structures of what are known as 
smart quality organizations in the Group and the brands, complet-
ing this in the reporting period. Among other things, smart quality 
organizations refine the methods we use to support the develop-
ment of software for selected critical features, and with which we 
can ensure that quality requirements are met. We are also taking 
advantage of the progress in digital technology to further optimize 
our existing processes and structures. For example, we use virtual 
measurement technologies or big data analyses when vehicles on 
the market encounter quality problems.
The strategy of Group Quality Management developed in this con-
text comprises the following four goals:
• We will impress our customers with our outstanding quality by 
understanding what exactly they perceive as quality and imple-
menting this in our products. 
• We will contribute to competitive products with optimal quality 
costs by ensuring robust processes, thereby reducing the ex-
pense involved in testing each vehicle. 
• In critical business processes, we will reinforce the principle of 
multiple-party verification and monitor achievement of mile-
stones even more closely. 
• We will become an excellent employer by promoting the person-
al development of every single employee even more intensively.
To achieve our goals, we are working on a variety of quality initia-
tives. All are focused on the topics that are decisive to the success of 
the quality organizations in the Volkswagen Group.

VISION ZERO: ZERO TRAFFIC FATALITIES THROUGH  
HIGH VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC SAFETY 
Vehicles from the Volkswagen Group brands should no longer be 
involved in accidents with fatalities and seriously injured people. 
This is at the heart of our “Vision Zero”. In order to achieve it, we 
have set three sub-goals:
• avoidable accidents should be prevented,
• unavoidable accidents should be positively mitigated and
• the severity of an accident should be minimized.
If we are to achieve these goals, our Group accident research de-
partment needs to collect data from real accidents. This includes 
carrying out technical analyses of the vehicles involved and deter-
mining the technical seriousness of the accident, medical analyses 
of the injuries suffered by those involved and psychological analy-
ses of the circumstances surrounding the accident. We use the 
findings of these analyses to develop measures to protect people 
inside and outside the vehicle. These include the development of 
bodywork concepts and occupant retention systems as well as new 
driver assistance systems capable of avoiding accidents. These in-
clude emergency braking systems and lane-keeping systems. If a 
collision cannot be avoided, passive systems ensure that the conse-
quences of the accident for vehicle occupants are either obviated or 
51
S H A P I N G  M O B I L I T Y  W I T H  A  V I E W  T O  T H E  F U T U R E
mitigated. Our developments here focus on coordinated interac-
tion between the vehicle structure and the occupant retention 
 system.
We also believe that further developing autonomous driving will 
have a very positive effect on safety. After all, if cars are able to 
steer and brake themselves and communicate with each other, 
driver error will play an ever decreasing role.

STRATEGIC APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT
We realize that the production and use of our vehicles pose risks for 
the environment and can have a negative impact on it. In light of 
climate change, the threat to air quality in urban areas and the use 
of natural resources, we must also refocus and transform our core 
business to take into account environmental needs. At the same 
time, stricter regulations as regards exhaust gas emissions and fuel 
consumption as a result of this situation along with the diesel crisis 
make it all the more important to take action. These developments 
require new and integrated solutions for the supply chain, produc-
tion processes, vehicle technologies, employee qualifications and 
communication with our customers.
We believe that these challenges offer opportunities and the 
chance to take the necessary action. Our aim is to become the 
world’s leading provider of sustainable mobility. At the same time, 
we would like to achieve a competitive advantage by using our 
know-how to make production more resource-efficient and to de-
velop environmentally friendly drive technologies. Environmental 
protection is not only a central goal of our TOGETHER – Strategy 
2025 future program – we want to be a “role model as regards envi-
ronment”. We believe that this offers an important opportunity to 
win back our stakeholders’ lost trust and to renew our “license to 
operate”. 
In order to be a role model, we consider environmental impact 
throughout the entire product life cycle: from manufacturing (in-
cluding the supply chain) to use and disposal. Life cycle assess-
ments help us to determine where in the life cycle we need to apply 
levers in order to improve our environmental performance. This 
is particularly important given the technological transformation 
towards e-mobility, as there is a shift of key environmental effects 
from the usage phase towards production at our sites and, to an 
even greater extent, our supply chain. We are thus encouraging the 
use of renewable energy sources, greater energy efficiency and the 
use of sustainable materials.
We have defined the following goals for environmental protection 
in the Volkswagen Group:
• To continuously improve our carbon footprint
• To continuously reduce harmful emissions
• To continuously reduce resource consumption
The Volkswagen Group is committed to achieving the Paris climate 
targets and is pursuing the goal of making its vehicle fleet com-
pletely carbon neutral by 2050. The decarbonization index (DCI) 
will be used as a strategic indicator which allows us to measure and 
manage the CO₂ emissions of products along the entire value chain. 
The DCI thus enables us to track progress towards climate-friendly 
mobility in a transparent, integrated manner. At the moment, we 
are working with the Volkswagen Group brands to define the target 
values for a decarbonization program. 
We are also determining the environmental impact reduction 
 production (UEP) indicator for the Group and its brands. We have 
set a target to reduce the environmental impact of production 
by 45% per vehicle compared with 2010 levels. UEP includes the 
consumption of energy and water, emissions of CO₂ and VOCs, as 
well as the amount of waste for disposal. 
In addition to meeting our own targets and goals, we aim to 
achieve top positions in key sustainability ratings. They are an im-
portant measure of success for us and help to make our activities 
more visible.
MANAGING GOALS AND MEASURES
The Group Board of Management is the highest internal decision- 
making level for environmental matters and also functions as the 
Group’s Sustainability Board. The Group-wide management of en-
vironmental protection is the responsibility of the Group Steering 
Committee for the Environment and Energy. Other committees 
manage important individual aspects for our products – such as 
CO₂ and exhaust emissions. These include the Group Steering Com-
mittee for CO₂ and the Group Steering Committee for Fleet Compli-
ance and Exhaust Emissions. 
The Volkswagen Group coordinates the activities of the brands, 
which in turn manage measures in the individual regions. In or-
ganizational terms, the brands and companies themselves are re-
sponsible for environmental issues. They define their environmen-
tal protection activities on the basis of the targets, guidelines and 
principles that apply throughout the Group. The following docu-
ments are binding:
• The TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 future program
• The environmental policy of Volkswagen AG
• The Group Environmental Principles Locations/Production
• The Group Environmental Principles Products
• The Mission Statement Biological Diversity
The Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy re-
ports to the Board of Management as to how the measures are pro-
gressing. Environmental officers and experts from throughout the 
Group meet regularly for the Group Environmental Conference in 
order to optimize the environmental focus along the entire value 
chain.
In 2018, 101 of our 123 sites including the central development ar-
eas were certified in accordance with ISO 14001 or EMAS. In terms 
of employee numbers, this equates to approximately 90%. In addi-
tion, 44 production locations have certified their energy manage-
ment systems in accordance with ISO 50001. Since 2009, the “Inte-
gration of Environmental Factors into the Volkswagen Brand’s 
Product Development” model used in the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand’s Technical Development department has also been cer-
tified to ISO/TR 14062. SEAT development is certified in accordance 
with ISO 14006.

C R E AT I N G  T R U S T  I N  E N V I R O N M E N TA L  P R O T E C T I O N
We involve our employees throughout the Group in order to 
achieve our Company’s environmental goals together. A good 
 example of this is the “Works Agreement on Environmental 
 Protection” at Volkswagen AG plants (including Technical Develop-
ment in Wolfsburg). In support of the production process, the 
Volkswagen brand has appointed environmental protection and 
energy experts.
In line with our life cycle approach, we involve our suppliers in our 
efforts to minimize our environmental impact early on. As a result, 
we can cover over 89% of production-relevant purchasing volume 
via the CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP). 
With our environmental and energy management system, the 
 entire Group has tools which enable us to meet our environmental 
 responsibility over the entire life cycle of our vehicles and in all 
stages of the value chain. 
TARGET PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
¹ Subject to official publication by the European Commission in the annual CO₂ fleet monitoring report.
²  Up to and including 2020, European fleet legislation will be complied with on the basis of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). After 2021, the NEDC target value will be changed into a WLTP target 
value through a process defined by lawmakers; the changing of the target value is not expected to put additional strain on the target value. 
³ Approximately 70% of the improvement in CO₂ emissions for cars and light commercial vehicles is attributable to an improvement in government CO₂ factors in electricity sourcing in China.

CLIMATE PROTECTION THROUGH DECARBONIZATION
1 Approximately 70% of the improvement in CO₂ emissions for cars and light commercial vehicles is attributable to an improvement in government CO₂ factors in electricity sourcing in China.
LIFE CYCLE ENGINEERING IS A CENTRAL APPROACH
We observe our environmental impact over the entire life cycle and 
all stages of the value chain. This includes the manufacturing pro-
cess with the extraction of raw materials, the manufacture of mate-
rials for the production process, the processes at our suppliers and 
our own production at our sites, the usage phase with vehicle emis-
sions and the necessary provision of fuel and the ultimate recy-
cling of the vehicle at the end of its life cycle. 
 
 Shaping Mobility with a View to the Future
For detailed life cycle assessments (LCA), we use special LCA soft-
ware with our own LCA database LEAD (Life Cycle Environmental 
Assessment Database), which ensures the exchanging of harmo-
nized data throughout the Group and a standardized basis for cal-
culating our environmental performance. With this software, we 
can identify the stages of the life cycle at which improvements will 
have the greatest effect and develop appropriate solutions. We call 
this life cycle engineering.
We will play our part in achieving climate targets by largely decar-
bonizing mobility by 2050. 
We use the decarbonization index (DCI) as a strategic indicator in 
this context to document our progress. It measures products’ CO₂ 
emissions along the entire value chain. The DCI is calculated by di-
viding our carbon footprint by the number of vehicles sold. It thus 
incorporates both direct and indirect CO₂ emissions from the indi-
vidual production sites (Scope 1 and 2) as well as all other CO₂ emis-
sions occurring throughout the life cycle of the vehicles sold – from 
the extraction of raw materials through the use phase to the recy-
cling of end-of-life vehicles (Scope 3). We are currently defining the 
DCI target figures for 2025 together with the Volkswagen Group 
brands. 
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING CO₂ EMISSIONS AND GOVERNANCE
The Volkswagen Group not only aims to achieve maximum trans-
parency as regards CO₂ emissions over the entire life cycle of its 
products. As part of reporting for the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP), we also make detailed statements regarding the risks and op-
portunities for the Company resulting from climate change and 
 reveal the governance structures as well as the associated strategies 
and measures for reducing emissions and avoiding risks. The 
Volkswagen Group currently has a CDP “A–” rating. Through CDP 
 reporting, we also largely comply with the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which 
was established by the International Financial Stability Board (FSB) 
and focuses on the voluntary disclosure of climate-related risks 
and opportunities in the financial markets sector. In order to fur-
ther  optimize compliance with the TCFD criteria, the company 
with support from outside will undergo a TCFD Readiness Check 
in 2019.
Every year, we calculate the Group’s carbon footprint. On this basis, 
we can determine the success of our measures and identify other 
areas for action. In order to reduce Group-wide CO₂ emissions, we 
focus on making improvements at our own production sites. Our 
most effective lever for reducing our global carbon footprint is to 
optimize CO₂ emissions from our vehicle fleet. After all, according 
to the Scope 3 GHG Inventory, 78% of all CO₂ emissions are pro-
duced during the use phase. It is important not only to increase ef-
ficiency but also to make greater use of low-CO₂ fuels.
The direct CO₂ emissions from our company cars are not shown 
separately. Extrapolated across the employees of all production 
sites, they account for approximately 4% of the Group’s Scope 1 
and 2 CO₂ emissions. Additional Group CO₂ compensation projects 
are not shown. The emissions which occur in the Volkswagen AG 
power plants for providing district heating and electricity to third 
parties are not included either. In 2018, these amounted to 
392,391 t of CO₂.
CO₂ EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION REDUCED IN 
PRODUCTION 
The Volkswagen Group uses a range of measures in order to achieve 
a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions1 in production. We are in-
creasing energy efficiency, pressing ahead with the switch from 
coal to gas and increasing our use of regenerative energy systems 
for our electricity supply. 37% of the energy that we use around the 
world now comes from renewable sources.
CO₂ emissions (Scope 1 and 2) have fallen since 2010, thanks to im-
proved energy efficiency and a reduced-carbon energy supply. 
Despite the inclusion of new production sites, direct CO₂ emissions 
in the passenger car and light commercial vehicle category and in 
the entire Group have been falling since 2010. This is despite a 
slight increase in energy consumption and CO₂ emissions at 
Volkswagen AG between 2017 and 2018. This reduction in the abso-
lute volume of emissions goes hand in hand with the decline in di-
rect CO₂ emissions per vehicle since 2010.
Since 2010, our total energy consumption has increased as a result 
of a continuous rise in production volumes. At the same time, we 
have been able to reduce energy consumption per vehicle since 
2010. Our overall consumption of electrical energy has risen in 
comparison with 2010, even though we have taken various efficien-
cy-enhancing measures to successfully reduce our electricity con-
sumption per vehicle since 2010.
Heat consumption relates to space heating demand for production 
and non-production areas in manufacturing facilities and heating 
demand for technical processes. Since space heating accounts for 
the greater proportion of the total heating demand, weather condi-
tions have a major impact on trends in overall heating demand.

DECARBONIZATION OF PRODUCTION
We are taking steps to decarbonize production at our sites by con-
tinuously increasing energy efficiency and by covering our re-
maining energy requirements in a way which reduces CO₂ emis-
sions. This includes generating our own energy and revising supply 
contracts.
One important lever for reducing energy consumption is operating 
all facilities according to actual needs. Hall ventilation is an impor-
tant cross-sectional technology. Sites throughout the Group are 
working to optimize it while the Group’s Energy working group en-
sures the transfer of knowledge. In the reporting period, around 
57,000 MWh of energy and 18,000 t of CO₂ was saved across sites 
through optimizing ventilation. 
Painting vehicle bodies is the most energy-intensive process. Most 
energy-related analyses thus focus on this area. In the reporting pe-
riod, 165,000 MWh of energy and 34,000 t of CO₂ was saved at 
Group sites through optimization measures in the paint shops.
Measures have also been implemented in energy generation and 
consumption. In the reporting period, the proportion of renewable 
energy from a wind power park for the Silao site in Mexico was 
 increased to 100% of all electricity required. The site thus meets 
93% of its energy needs through renewable energy sources.
At the Wolfsburg site, electricity and heat production is planned 
to be switched entirely to natural gas by 2022. This will result in a 
15% decrease in total CO₂ emissions from Group production sites. 
Most of the electricity for the Volkswagen Group’s German produc-
tion sites which is not produced by the Company itself is CO₂-neu-
tral Volkswagen Naturstrom® electricity. Approval for building and 
operating certified wind power facilities producing 12.8 MW at the 
MAN Salzgitter site was granted in 2017 as part of a public proce-
dure. The project was confirmed in the Federal Network Agency’s 
EEG Tendering Process 2018. The four wind turbines have been or-
dered from the manufacturer. They are due to go into operation in 
the fourth quarter of 2019.
When it comes to decarbonization, the sites that produce e-vehicles 
are particularly worthy of note. Production at the Brussels site is 
now completely CO₂-neutral: by purchasing biogas certificates and 
using green electricity, 95% of the energy required is produced us-
ing CO₂-free fuels. The remaining CO₂ emissions are compensated 
for through climate protection projects. 
At the Zwickau site too, a decision has been made to make produc-
tion of the I.D. CO₂-neutral from 2019. Through energy efficiency 
and highly efficient cogeneration as well as the sourcing of green

electricity, CO₂ emissions at the Zwickau site have been reduced. 
The remaining emissions will initially be compensated for through 
climate protection projects, although the intention is to gradually 
reduce this. In addition, agreements are being entered into with 
suppliers so that customers who purchase an I.D. will receive a ve-
hicle which is produced in a completely CO₂-neutral manner 
throughout the supply and production chain. At the moment, we 
are coming up with decarbonization programs for other sites.

CO₂ BALANCE IN THE USAGE PHASE
In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Re-
sources Institute (WRI), we report CO₂ emissions for 12 out of a to-
tal of 15 Scope 3 categories. Accordingly, around 94% of all Scope 3 
emissions are in the “Purchased goods and services” and “Usage 
phase” emissions categories. The calculation of CO₂ emissions in 
the usage phase is based on a Group fleet value representing the 
global cars and light commercial vehicles fleet in the four major re-
gions (EU28, USA, Brazil and China). In order to provide as complete 
a picture as possible, we also collect data on emissions in this cate-
gory that are produced during the production and transportation 
of fuels (“well to tank” emissions).
The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (exclud-
ing Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 123 g CO₂/km2,3 
in the reporting period – below the 2018 European limit of 
130 g CO₂/km. The small year-on-year increase is mainly due to 
the introduction of new measuring procedures. As small-volume 
manufacturers, the Lamborghini and Bentley brands each have an 
independent fleet for the purposes of the European CO₂ legislation 
and complied with their individual targets. Bentley complied with 
its individual target, Lamborghini was slightly above its target.
CO₂ emissions from the Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car 
fleet outside the EU break down as follows: in the USA, the fleet 
emissions figure is 163.2g/km (model year 2017), in China it is 
144.5 g/km (Volkswagen Group [Import] Co. Ltd. [VGIC] + Shanghai 
Volkswagen [SVW] + First Automotive Works [FAW-VW]) and in Bra-
zil it is 132.4 g CO₂/km (values subject to notification of the relevant 
authorities).

ROADMAP E: THE ROUTE TO ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
DRIVETRAINS
We regard innovative drivetrain technologies and alternative fuels 
as the key to reducing the CO₂ emissions of our vehicles. With the 
Roadmap E, we have launched the biggest electrification offensive 
in the automotive industry. By 2025, we would like to be a world 
leader for e-mobility and launch more than 80 new electrified mod-
els around the world.
Compared to vehicles with an internal combustion engine, e-vehi-
cles have less of an impact on the environment, as they produce no 
local emissions during use. Our calculations based on Golf-class ve-
hicles show that the CO₂ balance of e-vehicles is better over the en-
tire life cycle too. Nevertheless, e-mobility also leads to greenhouse 
gas emissions – both as a result of electricity use and during pro-
duction. Overall, the majority of emissions will shift towards pro-
duction in the future, primarily as a result of battery manufacture.
We believe that we and our partners in the supply chain have a par-
ticular responsibility here. We thus require that our suppliers use 
electricity from renewable sources when manufacturing high-volt-
age batteries (and other parts of the Modular Electric Toolkit). We 
also recycle lithium-ion batteries, which also helps to reduce CO₂ 
emissions. 
 
 Responsible Supply Chain
For all drivetrain technologies, the use of alternative fuels along 
with the use of green electricity is the most important CO₂ reduc-
tion measure. The use of “reduced-carbon” fuels is already possible 
across all brands, as their suitability for use in internal combustion 
engines has been proven on numerous occasions.
All other information regarding innovative vehicle technologies 
can be found in the chapter “Ensuring sustainable mobility”. 
 
 Shaping Mobility with a View to the Future
MAKING SUPPLIERS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR CLIMATE AND 
WATER AS WELL
We extend the responsibility for environmental effects of our vehi-
cles to our suppliers throughout the value chain. We have been ac-
tively involved in the CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP) since 2015. 
In 2018, we increased the number of suppliers who we survey as 
part of the SCP regarding responsibility for our climate and water 
to more than 200. This equates to 89% (2017: 43%) of our produc-
tion-related procurement spending (excluding services, VW Brazil, 
Scania and our joint ventures in China). With the climate protec-
tion survey, we achieve an above-average response rate of 79% (83% 
of production-related procurement spending). According to our 
suppliers’ self-assessments, they reduced their overall emissions by 
a total of 11.7 million t of CO₂-e compared to the previous year 
(2017: 16.5 million t of CO₂-e). Since 2016, the CDP has included sci-
ence-based targets (SBTs) in the questionnaire: 29% of our suppliers 
questioned have already set SBTs or have undertaken to set such 
targets. For the first time ever, we also carried out a survey on re-
sponsibility for water in 2018. We achieved an above-average re-
sponse rate of 66% (78% of production-related procurement spend-
ing) here. These developments for reducing emissions within the 
supply chain as well as our efforts when it comes to water contrib-
ute towards Volkswagen’s positive assessment in the WDP and CDP 
ratings.
 
 Responsible Supply Chain
PARTICIPATING IN EMISSIONS TRADING
Thirty-three of our Group locations participate in European emis-
sions trading and thus comply with a legal requirement of the EU. 
For 2018, a total of 1,085,244 emissions certificates were allocated 
to the Volkswagen Group free of charge (50,508 fewer than in the 
previous year). The European Commission is already planning to 
make further changes to emissions trading when the fourth trad-
ing period begins (from 2021). These could lead to a tightening of 
the system and thus to price increases for the certificates. In addi-
tion to the EU member states, other countries in which the 
Volkswagen Group has production sites are also considering intro-
ducing an emissions trading system. Seven corresponding pilot 
projects are running in China, for example, although they have not 
so far affected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government of-
ficially implemented a national emissions trading system at the 
end of 2017. Initially, the impact will only be on the energy genera-
tion sector; a gradual expansion is planned.

RESOURCE EFFICIENCY IN VALUE CREATION
7 Approximately 70% of the improvement in CO₂ emissions for cars and light commercial vehicles is attributable to an improvement in government CO₂ factors in electricity sourcing in China.
The efficient use and conservation of natural resources is one of 
our key environmental protection approaches. We set ourselves 
ambitious targets and measure our progress using the UEP criteri-
on (environmental impact reduction production). This was defined 
as part of the production strategy and includes targets for the 
Group and its brands. One element of the production strategy is the 
environmentally exemplary production initiative. This involves us 
working on four key issues in the period leading up to 2025:
• Setting and achieving ambitious environmental targets for 
production
• Developing a long-term vision for environmental targets in pro-
duction and rolling it out across the Group
• Strengthening employees’ environmental awareness and inte-
grating relevant environmental aspects into processes
• Achieving top positions in renowned environmental rankings 
In this context, the Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of re-
ducing the five key environmental indicators of energy and water 
consumption, waste for disposal (production-specific volumes on-
ly), and CO₂ and VOC emissions in production by 45% as a weighted 
average for each vehicle produced by 2025 – starting from 2010 lev-
els. Given their high environmental relevance, we focus particular-
ly on energy and CO₂. This objective applies to all of the Group’s 
production locations and is derived from our environmental re-
quirements for production processes, which are anchored in the 
Group’s environmental principles. The following charts show the 
development of these figures:
• Specific energy requirements: –19.1% (–17.9%)
• Specific CO₂ emissions: –34.3%4 (–26.3%)
• Specific VOC emissions: –53.3% (–49.5%)
• Specific water consumption: –15.1% (–17.1%)
• Specific waste for disposal (production-specific volumes  
only): –47.6% (–31.5%)
With the IT-supported “Massnahmen@web” system, we record en-
vironmental measures and encourage the Group-wide exchange of 
best practices. In the reporting period, around 1,500 implemented 
measures in the area of environment and energy were documented 
in this system. They serve to improve infrastructure and produc-
tion processes for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. In 
addition to the environmental improvements, these activities also 
resulted in savings of over €38 million in the 2018 reporting 
period. 
An example of our integrated approach for resource efficiency is 
the new MEB factory operated by our subsidiary company SAIC 
Volkswagen in Anting, Shanghai, one of China’s metropolitan re-
gions. Covering a total area of 610,000 m², it uses 27 environmen-
tally friendly technologies.
There is a particular focus on keeping water clean, saving energy 
and reducing CO₂ emissions. For example, the use of the latest 
welding tong technology in the planned body shop could render 
the use of the 12 bar network for compressed air unnecessary.
GREATER USE OF MATERIAL LOOPS
We are stepping up efforts to use closed material loops in our pro-
duction processes. When selecting raw materials, we opt for recy-
cled ones obtained from production waste or old materials. When 
developing new vehicles, we pay attention to the recyclability of the 
required materials, use high-quality recycled material and avoid 
pollutants. In compliance with legal requirements in the EU, our 
vehicles are 85% recyclable and 95% recoverable at the end of their 
lives. 
In order to calculate how much of a complete vehicle is recycled, we 
determine the materials for all components in the vehicle and their 
recycled materials content and add these together. Reliable infor-
mation straight from suppliers and sector-specific association data 
are essential for this.
The Aluminum Closed Loop Project, which for the first time 
achieved a closed loop for aluminum beyond Company boundaries 
in 2017, is an example of our approach. Aluminum scrap was re-
turned directly from our press shops to the supplier for reuse in 
 vehicles. The procedure which is used at Audi has already received a 
sustainability certificate (Performance Standard) from the Alumi-
num Stewardship Initiative. The project was continued in 2018 and 
will be expanded to other sites as well. With lithium-ion batteries 
too, we ensure not only the longest service life possible but also the 
use of materials from a closed loop.
SUSTAINABLE USE OF MATERIALS
In order to reduce our resource consumption, we rely on environ-
mentally friendly raw materials from renewable and nonrenewable 
sources when manufacturing our vehicles. Wherever possible, 
our Group brands use renewable raw materials such as the natural 
fi bers flax, cotton, wood, cellulose and hemp.
Regenerative materials can be used if they comply with all the 
 technical requirements and perform better than conventional 
 materials over the life cycle. In addition, our strict sustainability 
standards naturally apply for our suppliers.
We take advantage of new opportunities in body construction 
where we improve existing products or design new ones in the in-
terests of functionality, quality, safety and environmental compat-
ibility. Intelligent lightweight construction is the guiding principle 
here. For volume models, we use hot-formed, high-strength steel. 
Although energy consumption in production is higher, the lighter 
vehicle body allows a reduction in CO₂ emissions and thus an im-
provement in the overall environmental impact of the product. We 
60
also follow the vehicle and platform-specific mixed construction 
approach, i.e. we use various materials in a car body. At the same 
time, we use lightweight materials such as aluminum when devel-
oping new platforms.
RESPONSIBLE USE OF WATER
The supply chain, in particular obtaining and processing raw mate-
rials, is responsible for most of our water use. Because we cannot 
influence these aspects directly, we concentrate on our production 
sites. Of all fresh water that we use, 55% (around 22 million m³) is 
used by sites in risk zones. The concept for sustainable water man-
agement approved by the Group Steering Committee for the Envi-
ronment and Energy takes into account this aspect and defines 
four areas of activity:
•  the safe supply and disposal of water by protecting groundwater 
reserves against pollution,
•  efficient water use through closed loops over the life cycle,
•  social and ecological work through projects to protect water re-
serves and raise public awareness of environmental issues,
•  transparency through supporting the CEO Water Mandate and 
the CDP Water Disclosure Project (WDP). 
We manage water-saving processes at our Group’s locations during 
production in line with Group-wide specifications. In 2018, we 
achieved an A– rating in the WDP ranking for our sustainable water 
management.
Given our growing production figures and the integration of new 
sites in recent years, our Group’s absolute fresh water use has in-
creased in recent years. In contrast, the amount of fresh water used 
per vehicle has been falling continuously since 2010 – thanks to a 
range of recycling measures and the introduction of manufactur-
ing processes requiring little water. 
The amount of waste water produced is in line with the amount of 
fresh water that we use. Differences in quantities between fresh 
and waste water are the result of evaporation in cooling towers and 
during the manufacturing process. 
At the end of 2018, one of the Group’s biggest and most modern 
waste water treatment facilities went into operation at the Chengdu 
site in China. The facility cleans all waste water produced using a 
membrane bioreactor. In a further step, any salts contained are re-
moved from the water and the water is then used as a high-quality 
resource in the paint shops and cooling towers. The savings will be 
around 40% of the fresh water used, thus helping to reduce local 
water stress.

 discharges, Water withdrawal by source
EFFICIENT WASTE MANAGEMENT 
Our waste strategy aims to reduce the quantity of waste per unit 
produced and to reuse unavoidable waste to create high-quality 
materials. The focus is on:
• avoiding waste creation by optimizing production and auxiliary 
processes and increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency),
• reducing the quantity of waste produced by processing waste at 
sites and
•  prioritizing the reuse of waste and reducing the quantity of 
waste that needs to be disposed of.
In order to optimize our management of waste, we are increasingly 
using digital waste management systems in all German and a 
number of European plants of the brands Volkswagen, Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, Audi and MAN. They make it easier 
to control waste management processes and facilitate state control 
of the disposal of hazardous waste (electronic government). There 
are plans to implement more of these systems in Europe and other 
regions around the world.
In order to monitor waste management and recycling processes, we 
carry out regular cross-site and cross-OEM waste disposal audits in 
Germany and the rest of Europe. In addition, the auditors receive 
further training and hold regular discussions to ensure that they 
have a common understanding of the quality requirements associ-
ated with waste disposal services, to carry out audits of consis-
tently high quality and to allow other OEMs and suppliers to take 
advantage of the results. 
We reuse waste from production, logistics, workshops and techni-
cal development to produce high-quality materials. Our Procure-
ment division has established a reliable Group-wide system for re-
covering waste materials which can generate income, for example 
paper, plastics, wood or metal.
As a result of increased production in the passenger car and light 
commercial vehicle categories compared to 2010, the overall 
amount of hazardous waste produced has risen, while the overall 
amount of nonhazardous waste has fallen. We have managed to 
 reduce the amount of production-specific waste for disposal per 
 vehicle since 2010. Increasing the proportion of recoverable waste 
is also the result of the waste strategy established in our Group, 
which aims to ensure that a larger proportion of waste is recovered.
Given that Group-wide production has risen over the entire report-
ing period since 2010, the absolute quantity of metallic waste 
 materials has increased. VW Kraftwerk GmbH’s energy generation 
facilities inevitably produce power plant waste. In the previous 
 reporting period, we were able to recover materials from approxi-
mately 139,891 t of waste.

VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS UNDER CONTROL
Increased production volumes and downstream procedures for the 
thermal afterburning of VOC emissions from paint shops resulted 
in higher consumption of gases used to fuel manufacturing 
processes. 
Painting processes are the main cause of VOC emissions. In mod-
ern paint facilities, paints and process materials containing low 
levels of solvents are used. We take suitable steps to intercept or 
eliminate emitted solvents. In order to do this, we mainly use ther-
mal afterburning of outgoing air, which is downstream of the actu-
al painting process. In spite of an increase in vehicle production 
and the resulting increase in the amount of painting carried out 
since 2010, we have reduced our absolute VOC emissions. We have 
also significantly reduced the emissions per vehicle since 2010.
 
 Appendix > VOC emissions
GREEN LOGISTICS: ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORT
The transport chain plays a key role in our measures to increase re-
source efficiency. Our Group-wide Green Logistics initiative, which 
is geared to the A-S-I approach developed by the GIZ, is at the heart 
of this. A-S-I stands for
A – Avoid: 
Avoiding transport wherever possible
S – Shift: 
 Shifting goods to more environmentally friendly 
means of transport
I – Improve:  Use of improved or modern technology
On the basis of this approach, we have defined universal internal 
principles and derived from these strategic guidelines and rules de-
signed to ensure that our environmental standards in logistics pro-
cesses are implemented globally.
An important starting point for reducing CO₂ emissions is the se-
lection of the mode of transport. Maritime transport is one of the 
most efficient options given its high transport capacity. To further 
improve the environmental sustainability of transporting more 
than two million vehicles by ship every year, Volkswagen Group 
logistics will put two charter ships powered by liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) into service in 2019. This will lastingly reduce air pollution – 
nitrogen oxides by up to 30%, particulate matter by up to 60% and 
sulfur oxides by as much as 100%. CO₂ emissions will also be re-
duced by up to 25%. The two alternative vehicle transporters will be 
powered by an engine developed by MAN Diesel & Turbo. They will 
replace two of the ships in the Volkswagen fleet powered by con-
ventional heavy oil engines. Group Logistics is also relying on LNG 
trucks. There are plans to use more than 100 Scania LNG trucks in 
Northern Germany. In order to make this possible, shipping com-
panies will be offered help to procure these trucks and new LNG 
filling stations will be built.
Since 2014, the Euro 5 emissions standard has been the minimum 
standard for all new contracts for Volkswagen AG’s European ship-
ping operations. We also optimize the transport of materials and 
vehicles by ensuring maximum use of capacity and avoiding emp-
ty runs. We significantly reduce our freight volume with a very 
high packing density. 
BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
Biodiversity means the variety of life on our planet and comprises 
the variety of species, the genetic differences within species and 
the diversity of ecosystems. We rely on it as the basis for our con-
tinued existence: healthy food, clean water, fertile soils and a bal-
anced climate. Due to the global decline in biodiversity, the United 
Nations has declared the current decade to be the “UN Decade on 
Biodiversity”.
Volkswagen has been committed to protecting biodiversity since 
2007 and is a founding member of the Biodiversity in Good Com-
pany e. V. initiative. In our mission statement, we have committed 
to supporting the protection of species at all of our sites. We col-
laborate with local partners and suppliers in order to achieve this 
aim. Our membership of the Biodiversity in Good Company e. V. 
 initiative was temporarily suspended owing to the diesel issue. We 
resumed active membership at the beginning of 2019. 
Protecting biodiversity is an integral part of our environmental 
management. We contribute to achieving the targets of the UN 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) by supporting and carry-
ing out biodiversity projects, reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and utilizing resources as efficiently as possible. Volkswagen sup-
ports environmental education projects and networking between 
the various players in the fields of business, politics, society and ac-
ademia with a view to increasing public awareness of biodiversity 
conservation and general knowledge of the issue. 
Working with the University of Bochum, we are in the process of 
developing a suitable evaluation model to show the effect of biodi-
versity projects and promote biodiversity at our production sites.

STRATEGIC APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT
The global automotive industry is on the verge of radical change to-
wards e-mobility and connected driving. We would like to play a 
leading role in shaping this transformation. The decisions that we 
made in 2018 whereby three plants in Germany alone will be con-
verted to factories for e-vehicles are a visible sign of this. If we are to 
make a success of this change, we need to involve our employees, 
train them and prepare them for the forthcoming changes in the 
best way possible, as the success of our Company depends more 
than ever on the skills and commitment of our employees and on 
our attractiveness as an employer.
Most importantly, we must analyze exactly what effects the newly 
developing business areas will have on employment. We know that 
e-mobility will reduce complexity in development and production 
and that the depth of production will decrease as a result of digital-
ization. On the other hand, there will be a need for new career pro-
files and for people who combine for example IT and electronics 
qualifications with automotive engineering skills. 
We will guarantee a high level of job security in spite of the changes 
that are occurring. As an employer of more than 660,000 people, we 
have a great responsibility – for our employees, their families and 
for social and economic development in the areas surrounding our 
locations.
From a personnel perspective, we want to provide the right an-
swers to global challenges such as technological change and de-
mand for new mobility concepts. At the same time, however, we 
must keep track of the various developments on a national or con-
tinental level. They also require us to take into account the needs of 
employees in the local area, to restructure our business and to 
maintain and even increase our attractiveness as an employer.
In 2018, a large part of our Group’s personnel-related activities 
therefore focused on encouraging further cultural change, 
strengthening cooperation between all employees across hierar-
chies and establishing the importance of integrity in our actions. 
In doing so, we have taken important steps towards overcoming 
the effects of the diesel crisis. At the same time, Germany and other 
parts of Western Europe face not only risks resulting from demo-
graphic changes but also shortages of skilled workers who we will 
need for IT and digitalization in the future. We are actively combat-
ing these problems through extensive recruitment measures.
Our international presence enriches our Company and offers nu-
merous advantages. We regard the diversity of our employees with 
their broad range of experience, viewpoints and problem-solving 
ideas as a pillar of our future viability and as something that ought 
to be encouraged further. Between now and 2020, the Volkswagen 
Group will thus develop its existing approaches for boosting diver-
sity throughout the Company, put in place specific targets for in-
creasing the number of female employees and bring together all 
measures and concepts in a diversity management system.
At the Volkswagen Group, our belief in openness and diversity in 
the global markets is part of a clear attitude. We adhere strictly to 
the relevant national legal standards when dealing with all person-
nel matters. However, in line with our tradition of social partner-
ship and the balancing of interests, we go beyond these standards. 
We would like to allow all our employees throughout the world to 
share in Volkswagen’s social achievements and its high work and 
social standards. 
With our new Empower to Transform personnel strategy, which 
forms part of the Group’s TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, we are con-
stantly adapting our Group, our brands and their workforces to face 
up to the changing challenges in our surroundings. The most im-
portant aim of our personnel strategy is to be perceived as one of 
the world’s most attractive employers, even in the era of digitaliza-
tion and connected mobility. Through this, we would like to help 
make the Volkswagen Group a world-leading provider of mobility, 
one that is geared to sustainability and is profitable in the long 
term.
In terms of the Group personnel policy, our strategy sets out five 
general aims:
1. The Volkswagen Group aims to be an excellent employer with all 
of its brands and companies worldwide.
2. Highly competent and dedicated employees strive for excellence 
in terms of innovation, added value and customer focus.
3. A sustainable work organization ensures optimal working condi-
tions in factories and offices.
4. An exemplary corporate culture creates an open work climate 
that is characterized by mutual trust and collaboration.
5. The Company’s human resources work is highly employee-ori-
ented while also aiming for operational excellence and providing 
strategic value-added contributions.
Our strategy is being implemented in nine Group-wide strategic 
ini tiatives which are systematically assigned to the five central tar-
get areas and serve as key tools for operationalizing our HR policy 
program.
MANAGING GOALS AND MEASURES
Our HR work is based on standards and regulations which we com-
pletely revised in 2017. These include the Company’s management 
principles and the Group-wide Code of Conduct. The compliance 
system has been expanded further and the Code of Collaboration 
has been established as a basis for Group-wide cooperation. We are 
committed to complying with internal Group agreements such as 
the Social Charter, the Charter on Labor Relations, the Charter on 
Temporary Work, the Charter on Vocational Education as well as 
country and site-specific agreements. 
In spite of all the change and transformation processes going on in 
the Company, we never lose sight of our aim of providing working 
environments geared to the needs of people. In order to achieve 
65
B E I N G  A N  E x C E L L E N T  E M P L O Y E R
this aim, we are constantly improving the way in which our HR 
work is organized. In 2018, Volkswagen AG launched the Fokus Per-
sonal project. Designed to help the Company improve the quality of 
its HR work, it focuses on bundling processes, creating flatter or-
ganizational structures and improving the quality of supervision.
We are doing this to benefit our employees. Our approach involves 
not only providing optimum training for top teams but also work-
ing with departments to put in place a framework which will allow 
the teams to maximize their performance. We want to enable them 
to deal confidently with ongoing change. At the same time, we in-
volve all employees with impairments by encouraging inclusion 
and further developing programs for employees with impaired 
abilities.
We attach great importance to assessing the processes and mea-
sures that have been launched along with the general employment 
conditions as regards their effects on our attractiveness as an em-
ployer. We thus carry out annual employee surveys and measure 
satisfaction via our “Opinion Survey”.

EMPLOYER OF CHOICE
Our key aim is to be an attractive, reliable employer and to under-
line our leading role in this area. For us, being an attractive employ-
er means keeping all the promises that we made to our employees 
and making our employees aware of this in their day-to-day work. 
This is the only way to ensure the long-term performance and mo-
tivation of our workforce which are the basis for the Company’s 
competitiveness. Given that talented potential employees are be-
coming increasingly scarce, a high degree of credibility and aware-
ness is another key requirement if the Company is to be perceived 
as a top employer and is to attract and keep the best employees. In 
order to be able to fill vacancies in futuristic areas with experi-
enced and creative IT and digitalization experts, we are stepping up 
our efforts by forming a new recruiting unit and with extra em-
ployer branding activities such as the “beat ordinary thinking” re-
cruiting campaign, which was launched in Germany in 2018. 
Volkswagen AG’s very low fluctuation rate in all comparisons indi-
cates that we are well positioned as an attractive employer with our 
basic HR policies and are well equipped to cope with future 
challenges.

ENCOURAGING AN EXEMPLARY MANAGEMENT AND 
CORPORATE CULTURE
Participation, initiative and individual creative opportunities are 
particularly important when it comes to keeping our promises as 
an employer. We would like our employees to be responsible, com-
petent and confident “Company citizens” who actively take part in 
company affairs and get involved in decision-making processes. 
This distinct corporate culture is based on binding standards 
which protect individual employees at work and provide opportu-
nities to participate.
As part of the Group’s TOGETHER – Strategy 2025, the Volkswagen 
Group has launched a range of initiatives to update the corporate 
culture. Important milestones in the past two years were formulat-
ing a new Group-wide management guideline and introducing the 
Code of Collaboration, which sets out clear values for working to-
gether within the Group. It describes how collaboration is to take 
place within our group of brands using the terms “trust”, “genuine”, 
“straightforward”, “open-minded”, “as equals” and “united”.
Through Group-wide corporate culture conventions aimed at sev-
eral thousand executives, managers and employee representatives, 
we actively encouraged the creation of a common understanding 
of management and culture. The events focused on suitable ap-
proaches allowing managers to exemplify and convey integrity, 
corporate culture and compliance in their day-to-day work.
The Volkswagen Group Principles, which were introduced in 2018, 
set out the common basic values for all brands and companies 
within the Group. Seven simple “We” statements describe what the 
company stands for: “We take on responsibility for the 
environment and society”, “We are honest and speak up when 
something is wrong”, “We break new ground”, “We live diversity”, 
“We are proud of the work we do”, “We not me”, “We keep our word”. 
Group-wide activities such as team dialog also encourage employ-
ees to analyze the Group Essentials and to integrate them into all 
work processes.
OPINION SURVEY MEASURES EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION 
We attach great importance to involving our employees in process-
es and to ensuring that their opinions, assessments and criticism 
are heard. With our Group-wide opinion survey, we measure the 
satisfaction of our employees and thus the values relating to our in-
ternal employer attractiveness. It also serves to identify possible 
improvements and  inform managers where action needs to be tak-
en in their organizational units. The annual results of the Opinion 
Survey are looked at intensively throughout the Company and pro-
vide impetus for improvement processes in all organizational 
units – especially when it comes to management and collaboration 
issues. The 2018 survey was carried out at 175 sites and companies 
in 50 countries. Approximately 480,000 of over 600,000 employees 
in the participating Group units responded; this is equivalent to a 
response rate of 79%. In 2018, the score on the employee satisfac-
tion index – a key indicator generated by the Opinion Survey – was 
78.9 out of 100 possible index points and thus slightly above the 
score in the previous year (2017: 78.3 index points).
REMUNERATION IN LINE WITH PERFORMANCE AND GEARED TO 
SUCCESS
In accordance with our global Social Charter, the remuneration and 
fringe benefits for our employees correspond at least to the legally 
required minimum level which is to be guaranteed in the particu-
lar country. This not only applies to our own workforce, but to all 
our suppliers’ employees as well. As they are collectively agreed 
with trade unions, our rates of pay are usually considerably higher 
than the prevailing minimum levels. 
When setting individual pay rates, we make no distinction between 
people of different genders or belonging to other groups: our em-
ployees are selected, appointed and nurtured exclusively on the 
 basis of their qualifications and abilities. Remuneration is based 
strictly on the job performed and individual performance. Gener-
ally speaking, it is calculated in our Companies with primarily 
 European sites using a three-level system. This provides basic re-
muneration to cover living expenses, a performance-based com-
ponent and a collectively agreed right to a share of the Company’s 
profits. 
Employees of Group companies enjoy further Company benefits. 
Depending on location, these may include subsidized transport 
and meals, low-cost accommodation, monthly childcare allowanc-
es and discounts on certain leisure activities. Additional healthcare 
or supplementary pension benefits round off the range of company 
benefits at specific sites. By offering occupational pension schemes, 
67
B E I N G  A N  E x C E L L E N T  E M P L O Y E R
Volkswagen AG, its brands and subsidiaries make an important 
contribution towards securing their employees’ income in old age. 
WORK/LIFE BALANCE WITH FLEXIBLE WORKING HOURS
We are constantly taking steps to make it easier for employees to 
reconcile their work and private lives by offering flexible working 
time models. For example, we would like to take into account the 
specific needs of new parents, single parents or employees who are 
also carers. The rules and programs here vary from country to 
country and are determined by the legal conditions and the results 
of collective negotiations with trade unions.
In Germany, the large number of people who take advantage of 
their legally governed parental leave entitlement proves how many 
employees wish for reconcilability of work and family life. In our 
Company regulations too, we endeavor to take into account the fact 
that many employees need greater flexibility as regards their work-
ing hours and place of work. Since 2016, a far-reaching Company 
agreement for working outside Company premises (mobile work-
ing) has been in place. Group brands such as Audi and Porsche have 
similar arrangements.
Our reinstatement guarantee offers a very high level of flexibility. 
For the past 20 years or so, Volkswagen AG employees have been 
able to take up to eight years’ leave of absence without having to 
give a reason. Regardless of whether this leave is used for a sabbati-
cal, for parental leave or for career development purposes, employ-
ees have a guaranteed right to re-employment on the same terms 
and conditions as before.
We also help our employees to care for and look after close rela-
tives. Employees can take up to ten days’ leave at short notice in or-
der to organize care for sick relatives, for instance. Employees can 
take up to six months’ leave or reduce their working hours for the 
same period in order to care for a relative. Employees can work 
part-time for up to 24 months in order to care for their families. 
The Volkswagen Group in Germany and abroad endeavors to offer 
childcare geared to specific groups of people. In addition to the 
 existing facilities, a number of daycare centers near our operating 
locations have been set up in recent years. All German sites of the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen Commer-
cial Vehicles and MAN brands offer childcare during school 
holidays.
 
 Appendix > Returning from parental leave
CO-DETERMINATION AND EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION 
We involve our employees in strategic decisions as early as possible 
in order to achieve lasting acceptance of necessary changes among 
the workforce. When establishing cooperative labor relations 
marked by social harmony, we are guided by universally valid hu-
man rights and the standards of the International Labor Organiza-
tion (ILO). On this basis, we have agreed various charters and decla-
rations with our Group European Works Council (GEWC) and Global 
Group Works Council (GGWC) that safeguard the collective rights of 
our employees in the workplace and set out basic work policy prin-
ciples. We implement them rigorously throughout the Group to-
gether with the co-determination committees or the employee rep-
resentatives at the relevant sites.
They include:
• The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen (Social Charter), which is geared to the relevant ILO 
conventions
• The Charter on Labor Relations, which sets out additional infor-
mation, consultation and co-determination rights for employee 
representatives of the brands, companies and locations repre-
sented by the Group European Works Council and the Global 
Group Works Council
•  The Charter on Temporary Work, in which Group management 
as well as the Group European Works Council and the Global 
Group Works Council have agreed on principles relating to tem-
porary work, for example guide values for the ratio of temporary 
to permanent employees, equal pay, qualification measures and 
the limitation of employment periods with a subsequent review 
as to whether to take on the employee permanently
• The Charter on Vocational Education and Training, in which 
 professional training is established as a central part of labor rela-
tions. According to this charter, key aspects of training and the 
selection process, the duration and quality of professional train-
ing and the taking on of employees permanently are to be set out 
as part of the local implementation process for all sites.
In addition, there are a number of country and site-specific agree-
ments that stipulate, for example, standards for further training or 
preventive healthcare measures.
These policy foundations underpin the rights of employees and 
their elected representatives at Group level in the European and 
Global Works Councils. Executive managers and employee repre-
sentatives meet regularly to consult on relevant issues. All mem-
bers of the Group European Works Council and the Global Group 
Works Council attend a joint session every year. As well as discuss-
ing the current situation at the various sites, the respective HR 
managers and Group executive management also share informa-
tion about product and workforce plans as well as social welfare 
and personnel standards.
68
At many sites, employees are represented in two ways: firstly, by a 
trade union, and secondly, by representatives elected to a works 
council. Many companies in the Group have a supervisory board 
on which the workforce is represented. The Charter on Labor Rela-
tions allows employee representatives around the world to con-
clude agreements with local management on specific rights to in-
formation, consultation and co-determination.
We attach great importance to informing the workforce of changes 
as early as possible. In committees made up of equal numbers of 
employee and employer representatives, both sides receive all rele-
vant information at the same time.
This far-reaching form of participation has proved highly success-
ful over many decades. It ensures that change processes are 
 approached together and are supported by the entire workforce. 
Through their creativity, their knowledge and their initiative, 
 employees take on responsibility for improving processes and 
products and ultimately help us to achieve our sustainability 
goals.  More than 42,500 ideas were entered as part of idea manage-
ment, resulting in savings of approximately €128 million at the 
 German sites of Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH and 
Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH. At the beginning of 2019, we 
launched a new company agreement and a new IT system in order 
to further optimize idea management processes. 
 
 Appendix > Ideas management
QUALIFICATION IN EACH PROFESSIONAL PHASE
Manufacturing innovative, efficient and environmentally friendly 
automobiles requires the very highest technological excellence 
every day. The comprehensive specialist qualifications of our em-
ployees in manual and technical fields remain the basis for this. 
They are also an important prerequisite if we are to achieve our 
planned transformation from a vehicle manufacturer to a mobility 
provider. The electrification of the vehicle fleet as well as the transi-
tion towards connected, autonomous driving mean that employees 
will need very different qualifications in the future. Skills in IT or 
function-oriented, model-based development will complement the 
activities of engineers and other specialists. Traditional processes 
such as casting will fade into the background, while new qualifica-
tions in high-voltage technology, new joining techniques and auto-
mation systems will be needed.
We need to prepare for these changes now and are therefore devel-
oping our highly differentiated basic and further training system 
with tailored qualification measures to meet specific needs. At 
Volkswagen, our measures enabling employees to acquire further 
qualifications are organized around vocational groups. Employees 
who require similar skills to perform their jobs and who possess 
the associated competencies are said to belong to a vocational 
group. The general and technical competencies required for each 
specific activity are defined in skills profiles. A wide range of quali-
fication measures are available to employees, enabling them to de-
velop new skills throughout their careers and build on their knowl-
edge all the time. In this process, they are also able to learn from 
more experienced colleagues, who pass on their knowledge as ex-
perts in the vocational group academies. At Volkswagen, the possi-
bility of making a contribution through qualifications and devel-
oping new skills in each career phase is an important part of our 
promise as an employer.
DUAL TRAINING AS THE FLAGSHIP OF PROFESSIONAL 
QUALIFICATION
Within the Volkswagen Group, the dual vocational training creates 
the basis for high levels of expertise and excellent performance. 
With its flexible combination of practical activities and theoretical 
knowledge, it prepares our young professionals for the forthcom-
ing challenges in the best way possible. For this reason, we focus on 
our successful dual vocational training scheme throughout the 
Company and believe it is the best way for employees to acquire the 
qualifications they need. 
On an international level, we implement the high German training 
standards but also take into account the relevant national stan-
dards and regulations. As with employee qualifications, the con-
tent of the training is very much geared to the skills required in the 
various vocational groups. When planning new plants, we factor in 
dual vocational training as standard from the outset. Accordingly, 
more than three-quarters of all trainees in the Group are now 
learning their trades through the dual system.
In 2017, the Volkswagen Group was training 19,244 young people 
in 50 trades. We also support the career development of new en-
trants once they have completed their apprenticeship. For example, 
particularly talented young specialists are nurtured in talent 
groups. In the reporting period, 81 skilled workers joined this de-
velopment and qualification program. Through the “Wanderjahre” 
(year abroad) program, fully qualified vocational trainees also 
have the opportunity to move to an international Group company 
for 12 months. During the reporting period, 27 Volkswagen Group 
sites in 17 countries took part in this development program. In 
2018, 67 participants from Germany plus 15 from seven other 
countries began their year abroad within the Volkswagen Group in 
Germany.

FURTHER TRAINING FOR SKILLED WORKERS AND MANAGERS 
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, skilled workers can choose 
from a broad range of advanced training courses. These range from 
further training in occupational or cross-disciplinary areas of 
 general interest to the company to specific qualifications in voca-
tional groups and even comprehensive personnel development 
programs. With further training, the focus also remains on the du-
al training principle, which combines theoretical learning with 
practical experience. Overall, around 114,000 qualification activi-
ties totaling 15.1 million hours of training were completed across 
the Group in 2018. The majority of our development programs and 
 selection procedures for executives, foremen and managers are 
standardized throughout the Group. In the reporting period, the 
Volkswagen Group Academy provided around 681 training courses 
and assessment centers for executives, foremen and managers in 
twelve countries.
DEVELOPING SKILLS ON AN ACADEMIC LEVEL 
As part of the Volkswagen Group Academy, AutoUni employs top 
in-house experts and collaborates with higher-education 
institutions to equip the Company with valuable knowledge for the 
future. In 2018, around 9,450 people took part in over 170 AutoUni 
events all over the world; a growing number were transmitted to 
the Group’s various sites via Skype. 
Volkswagen is exploring new ways of expanding the knowledge 
base for the digital transformation within the Company. With the 
innovative Faculty 73 program, which was launched in autumn 
2018, we train hundreds of software developers per year. The Auto/
Uni program is designed for employees with basic IT skills as well 
as in-house and external candidates with other suitable basic 
qualifications. 
The AutoUni also connects the internal contact persons for univer-
sities within the Group and registers global university partner-
ships: in the reporting period, there were more than 1,700 national 
and international partnerships with universities, technical colleges 
and research institutions.
ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Volkswagen Group stands for respect, tolerance and equal 
rights. For us, these values not only reflect our inner convictions – 
they are also crucial for our competitiveness as a company and our 
attractiveness as an employer. Anyone who fails to serve a range 
of  markets and target groups or to recruit and nurture new talent 
is missing out on future opportunities. We need a variety of people 
and a working environment in which they can contribute their 
 different skills. A common understanding of management and 
 culture is the key to achieving this respectful attitude within the 
 Company. We aim to deepen this understanding by strengthening 
people’s rights and through efficient structures and measures to 
raise awareness of the issue. 
COMMITMENT TO NONDISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT
Taking the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into 
 account, we champion diversity and equal opportunities at all our 
locations around the world. We encurage equal treatment irrespec-
tive of a person’s ethnic origin, skin color, gender, disability, ideo l-
ogy, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, social background or 
political beliefs, provided the latter is based on democratic princi-
ples and tolerance towards those who hold different views. The 
Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct provides guidance through-
out the Group and is reinforced in the Social Charter.
Under the code, every employee and manager is responsible for 
 ensuring that colleagues work together in partnership. They are 
obliged to report any breaches immediately. If employees feel dis-
criminated against, they can turn to trained experts within the 
Group for advice and support. At the initiative of the Works Coun-
cil, employees’ obligations and rights to non-discrimination were 
laid down in the “Cooperative Conduct at the Workplace” company 
agreement applicable to all Volkswagen AG employees at all its 
sites. 
Every new employee receives a copy of it when they join the com-
pany and the contents are also covered in management training 
courses. Every employee can refer to the Company agreement 
in the event of a breach. All reports are investigated and, if a com-
plaint is justified, countermeasures are taken immediately.
DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT HELPS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE 
WITH TARGETS
In the reporting period, we continued to work hard to implement a 
specific diversity approach, which we will systematically develop 
into a Group-wide diversity management system between now and 
2020. In 2018, the Volkswagen Group’s second diversity conference 
took place at the Scania headquarters in Södertälje (Sweden). Fifty 
diversity managers from 20 nations and from all Group brands 
took part. The diversity managers’ key tasks include raising aware-
ness of the importance of the issue at Company locations and 
achieving a common understanding of diversity within the Group.
70
The foundations for the Group-wide rollout of awareness training 
have also been laid. The aim of the training is to create awareness of 
the importance and value of diversity. It also aims to raise aware-
ness among managers in order that they encourage diversity and 
ensure a working environment free of prejudice and processes pro-
viding equal opportunities. 
Our approach centers around binding quotas for women in mana-
gerial positions and targets for the internationality of our top man-
agement. These two figures are combined in our diversity index, 
which has been in force since January 1, 2017. 
The diversity index forms part of our HR strategy and applies 
throughout the Volkswagen Group. With this index, we manage 
measures and measure the extent to which they have been imple-
mented. The calculation is based on current workforce figures. The 
proportion of women in management amounted to 13.8% in 2018 
and was therefore at the prior-year level; we aim to raise this to 
20.2% by 2025. We aim to increase the level of internationalization 
in top management, the uppermost of our three management tiers, 
to 25.0% in 2025; in the past fiscal year this was 19.2 (18.7)%. These 
targets are decided by the Group’s Board of Management and are 
binding for the whole organization.
PURSUING GOALS FOR INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF 
WOMEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GERMAN LAW 
We have formulated goals as regards the proportion of women for 
Volkswagen AG in accordance with German law. In line with Ger-
many’s law on equal participation for women and men in executive 
positions, Volkswagen AG has set itself targets for increasing the 
proportion of women in management by the end of 2021: 13% on 
the first level of management and 16.9% on the second level within 
the active workforce. As of December 31, 2018, the proportion of 
women in the active workforce on the first level of management 
was 10.7% (2017: 10.4%), while on the second level the proportion 
was 15.4% (2017: 14.0%). The Group’s Board of Management and Su-
pervisory Board are regularly updated on the progress we are mak-
ing towards these targets. 
In the reporting period, the proportion of women in managerial 
roles as part of the overall workforce of our Group in Germany rose 
to 9.4% in senior management and 14.4% in management generally 
(as of year end, excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche). The propor-
tion of women in top management increased from 6.5% in 2017 to 
7.0% in the reporting period (as at year end, excluding Scania, MAN 
and Porsche). The proportion of women in management across the 
Group in Germany (excluding Scania, MAN and Porsche) thus came 
to 12.1%, up from 11.4% the year before.
A FOCUS ON DEVELOPING FEMALE TALENT
We would like to increase the proportion of women in all divisions 
of the Volkswagen Group and are paving the way for this early on. 
In Germany, for instance, we are specifically seeking to attract 
female talent, for example by arranging special work experience 
and orientation days for young women. Our aim is to increase the 
proportion of female trainees in industrial and technical trades 
from 22% in 2018 to 30% in 2020. Various brands are involved in 
the Girls’ Day and future days, which give a realistic insight into 
 industrial and technical trades within the automotive sector.
By recruiting female academics, we lay the foundations for a higher 
proportion of female managers. We recruit the best graduates from 
each year in the required disciplines, taking as our starting point 
the proportion of female graduates on each course. When all the 
courses of relevance to Volkswagen are averaged out, these differ-
entiated quotas currently produce a female graduate recruitment 
target of 30%.
Family-friendly working models, mobile working and the option of 
working part-time even for managers play an important role in 
 encouraging more women to work for the Company. Job sharing for 
managers is a particularly effective tool for combining a career and 
a family flexibly and one that we actively encourage. 2017 saw a 
fourth group embark on our cross-brand management mentoring 
program, with 55 women participating (mainly from the 
Volkswagen Group in Germany). There will be a modular offering 
in the future, enabling talents to freely choose individual modules. 
In addition, Volkswagen offers the “Kompass” program specifically 
to encourage female talent to aim for a career in management. In 
the reporting period, 60 women took part in this program.
 
 Appendix > Female employees, Proportion of women
FURTHER IMPROVING INCLUSION IN THE WORKPLACE
Our understanding of diversity extends far beyond gender equality 
and internationality. We also pay particular attention to the inte-
gration of employees with disabilities. In this context, we concen-
trate on promoting health and providing future-oriented working 
environments with maximum accessibility. This includes enabling 
all employees – regardless of any disability – to find, access and use 
all buildings, information and communication facilities without 
outside help.
In 2017, we published an Inclusion Report for Volkswagen AG for 
the first time. This set out details of our integration work with im-
pairments or differing abilities. On an international level, we oper-
ate five protected workshops and are setting up additional work-
stations for more than 300 people with disabilities at the ŠKODA 
production sites in the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, these 
activities won an award as one of the “Personnel Projects of 2018”.
Our responsibility for keeping employees in valuable, meaningful 
activities for their entire career if possible also extends to the 
needs of employees with a restricted working capacity. After all, 
indivi d ual forms of work organization can result in higher perfor-
mance and job satisfaction levels for these groups of employees. 
The Work2Work program provides a good example. Since 2001, 
71
B E I N G  A N  E x C E L L E N T  E M P L O Y E R
Volkswagen AG has opened up new career opportunities within the 
Company for employees with differing abilities. The program 
matches the employees’ potential and the requirements of the par-
ticular job in a way which allows the employee to create significant 
value for the Company in spite of not being able to do their original 
job. More than 2,100 employees have benefited from this program 
in recent years. In Wolfsburg, 714 employees are currently em-
ployed in Work2Work jobs in around 100 different areas.
HEALTHY AND SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT
We want to strengthen not only our employees’ specialist skills but 
also their health. This is important if they are to perform well at 
work and cope with the stress on their bodies which is typical when 
working in a production company. In the area of health, sustaina-
bility means for us that as many employees as possible can retire 
from work healthy. This long-term approach also helps our Group 
to cope with demographic change in the form of an aging popula-
tion, which is now characteristic in Germany.
Volkswagen’s holistic approach to health management goes far be-
yond statutory preventive healthcare and occupational health and 
safety; it also includes aspects such as work organization, ergonom-
ics, prevention, integration and rehabilitation, along with leader-
ship culture.
HOLISTIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHED
Our employees receive medical care at all our sites in accordance 
with the relevant national legal regulations and internal rules and 
on the basis of Group guidelines on protecting and promoting 
health. Among other things, we keep a record of particularly de-
manding activities. We offer employees who perform these activi-
ties special prevention programs as well as more options for rotat-
ing jobs. All Group sites have at least one facility for dealing with 
medical emergencies. Most of them also offer medical care provid-
ed by a company doctor.
As part of the strategy process, we set up a Group initiative for 
health which focuses on further developing prevention, Company 
health management and ergonomics. It aims to improve employ-
ees’ quality of life, to reduce stress, to avoid chronic illnesses, to im-
prove employees’ performance and to reduce absences.
 
 Appendix > Absenteeism
IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY 
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the 
continuous improvement of occupational health and safety is vi-
tally important to us. In 2004, the Volkswagen Group established 
an internationally valid occupational health and safety policy. 
Among other things, it calls for compliance with legal require-
ments and the development of targets in Group companies for con-
tinually improving occupational health and safety at work. In the 
area of occupational health and safety, sustainability means for us 
that employees do not suffer accidents when working. With the in-
troduction of the “Safety First” strategy, Volkswagen is aiming to 
achieve this goal and would like superiors and employees to follow 
this guiding principle in everything they do. The strategy also re-
quires all Volkswagen Group production sites to comply with the 
ISO 45001 standards and more specific Group requirements.
A Group process standard was introduced to provide cross-brand 
information in the event of serious or fatal accidents involving our 
own employees or workers from partner firms. On this basis, spe-
cific measures can be taken to prevent similar accidents across all 
our sites in the future. 
 
 Appendix > Accident severity, Accident indices
PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION ENHANCED THROUGHOUT 
THE GROUP
We are also boosting health protection by promoting individual 
health screening and prevention. The Volkswagen Checkup – a free, 
comprehensive health screening program for all employees – is 
now established at all Volkswagen AG German sites and helps em-
ployees stay fit and healthy and improve their performance. In 
2018, 12,020 checkups were carried out at Volkswagen AG sites. The 
checkup is now available at virtually all international sites and is 
carried out in accordance with Group-wide standards. Country- 
specific additional examinations are also available. 
We offer a rehabilitation program at many sites. This is designed to 
reintegrate employees following serious or prolonged illness by 
providing specific job-related support at an early stage. The aim is 
to restore the employees’ working ability and performance within 
three to six months. At Volkswagen AG, individual services are in-
tegrated into the rehabilitation program. One example is the “Job/
Reha” with measures focusing on orthopedic or psychological 
rehabilitation.

BASIS FOR REPORT
As in the previous year, Volkswagen AG will issue a nonfinancial 
statement at company level for reporting year 2018 and a non-
financial Group statement for reporting year 2018, which will be 
published together as a combined separate nonfinancial report 
in the sense of HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 as part 
of the Group Sustainability Report 2018. The nonfinancial report 
is drawn up in accordance with HGB sections 315b and 315c, in 
 conjunction with sections 289b through 289e. Furthermore, the 
GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) were used 
as the framework for drawing up the nonfinancial report. In this 
nonfinancial report, Volkswagen has systematically used the GRI 
Standards as the underlying structure for the materiality analysis 
and reports on management approaches as well as the specific 
standard disclosures. In line with CSR-RUG, this nonfinancial re-
port will concentrate on those action areas that are necessary for 
an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s business develop-
ment, overall performance and position as well as the Volkswagen 
Group’s influence on nonfinancial aspects. 
Unless indicated otherwise, any information provided for the Group 
also applies to Volkswagen AG. In addition to Volkswagen AG, the 
Group includes all major subsidiaries inside and outside Germany 
that are directly or indirectly controlled by Volkswagen AG. In the 
financial data, our joint ventures in China are reported on using 
the equity accounting method. However, they are included in full 
(100%) in volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) 
and environmentally relevant data.
In terms of content, the Group Sustainability Report was prepared 
in compliance with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting 
Initia tive (GRI), applying the “Comprehensive” option. At the same 
time, the GRI Content Index shows how we are implementing the 
requirements of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and 
are using as guidance the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) as well as the criteria of the German Sustainability 
Code (DNK).
Important ideas for the report’s content were provided by the ques-
tionnaires and appraisals of sustainability-oriented rating agen-
cies. We also took our lead from Stakeholder Engagement Standard 
AA1000.
To validate issues of material significance for the Volkswagen Group 
resulting from various global challenges, we drew upon the find-
ings of the Volkswagen Group’s Stakeholder Panel, which has been 
in place for many years now, as well as the results of the latest com-
prehensive stakeholder surveys conducted by Group companies 
Audi, MAN, Porsche and Volkswagen Financial Services.
To manage its sustainability performance, the Volkswagen Group 
records strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance 
with the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and 
the framework for ESG (environment, social and governance) indi-
cators defined by the European Federation of Financial Analysts’ 
Societies (EFFAS). Increasingly, shareholders and investors are call-
ing for transparency, making them an important target group for 
our sustainability reporting. 
The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators presented 
in previous years. We have made no changes to the methods used 
to collect and measure the data on our sustainability performance. 
The Volkswagen Group’s global production network comprised 
123 production sites as of the end of the reporting year. This is now 
the seventh time we have reported our emissions in line with Scope 
3 of the WBCSD/WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG).

REPORT AUDITING
The combined separate nonfinancial report prepared in accordance 
with HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 was subjected to 
a voluntary, limited assurance audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC) in accordance with 
ISAE 3000 (Revised) to verify that its disclosures comply with the 
principles of the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global 
Reporting Initiative and the relevant statutory requirements.

Further information on the audit can be found in the independent 
auditor’s remarks on nonfinancial reporting in the Independent 
Assurance Report.
ADDITIONAL REPORTING WITHIN THE GROUP
The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB sec-
tion 315c, in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. By refer-
encing this combined separate nonfinancial report, all Group com-
panies required by national legislation to disclose nonfinancial and 
diversity-related information pursuant to Directive 2014/95/EU are 
exempted from the obligation to submit their own nonfinancial 
 reports. 
More detailed insights into our environmental management ap-
proach can be found in the environmental statements published by 
numerous Group locations as part of their voluntary participation 
in the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The 
sustainability reports published by the Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania 
and ŠKODA brands also bear testimony to the Group’s commitment 
to sustainability.
EDITORIAL NOTES
The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group as a 
whole. Where information relates to individual Group brands only, 
this is clearly indicated in the text.  
REPORTING PRACTICES
The nonfinancial report and Group Sustainability Report are pub-
lished annually. In addition to information about the Group’s sus-
tainability activities in the 2018 fiscal year (January 1 to December 
31, 2018), the sustainability report also contains selected informa-
tion from the 2019 fiscal year. 
The editorial deadline was February 4, 2019. Both reports appear in 
German and English. The next nonfinancial report will be pub-
lished in the first quarter of 2020, and we anticipate that the next 
Group Sustainability Report will also appear in the second quarter 
of 2020. 
LEGAL INFORMATION
This sustainability report contains statements relating to the fu-
ture business development of the Volkswagen Group. These state-
ments are based on assumptions regarding the development of the 
economic and legal conditions in individual countries and eco-
nomic regions, in particular as they relate to the automotive indus-
try, which we have made on the basis of the information available 
to us and which we consider to be realistic at the time of publica-
tion. The estimates given entail a degree of risk, and actual develop-
ments may differ from those forecast. Any changes in significant 
parameters relating to our key sales markets or any significant 
shifts in exchange rates of relevance to the Volkswagen Group will 
have a corresponding impact on the development of our business. 
In addition, there may be departures from our expected business 
development if the assessments of factors influencing sustainable 
value enhancement, and of risks and opportunities, presented in 
this sustainability report develop in a way other than we expect at 
the time of publication, or if additional risks and opportunities or 
other factors emerge that affect the development of our business.
CALCULATION OF FLEET EMISSIONS IN EUROPE
The figure for Group fleet CO₂ emissions is the figure annually re-
corded in the course of official monitoring pursuant to “Regulation 
(EC) 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 
April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new pas-
senger cars as part of the Community’s integrated approach to re-
duce CO₂ emissions from light-duty vehicles” by the European En-
vironment Agency (EEA) on behalf of the European Commission for 
the brands belonging to the group of connected manufacturers 
“VW Group PC”. This figure is the volume-weighted average of all 
specific CO₂ emissions from new passenger cars registered for the 
first time in the respective calendar year, based on the calculation 
logic defined in EU Regulation 443/2009. Provided that the figure 
for fleet CO₂ emissions is set down in a Commission Implementing 
Decision to confirm or amend the average specific CO₂ emissions 
and specific emissions targets for manufacturers of passenger cars 
for the respective calendar year in accordance with Regulation (EC) 
443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, this fig-
ure is published; otherwise, provisional CO₂ emissions figures are 
published, which are evaluated on the basis of internal systems us-
ing the same logic.
NOTICE PURSUANT TO EU DIRECTIVE 1999/94 EC
Further information on the official fuel consumption and official 
specific CO₂ emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the 
“Guide on the Fuel Economy, CO₂ Emissions and Power Consump-
tion of All New Passenger Car Models Offered for Sale on the Ger-
man Market”, which can be obtained free of charge from all sales 
outlets of and directly from DAT Deutsche Automobil Treuhand 
GmbH, Hellmuth-Hirth-Strasse 1, 73760 Ostfildern, Germany.

ABOUT THE NONFINANCIAL REPORT (NFR)
The following index provides an overview of the disclosures re-
quired for the nonfinancial report in accordance with HGB section 
315c in conjunction with sections 289c to 289e, together with 
 appropriate references to the sections of this Group Sustainability 
 Report in which these disclosures may be found. 
PwC has subjected the elements of the Group Sustainability Report 
that make up the nonfinancial report to a voluntary limited assur-
ance audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised).
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are highlighted. 
References to disclosures outside the summarized management 
 report are supplementary information and do not form part of the 
nonfinancial report.
Based on various global challenges, the Volkswagen Group has 
drawn up a list of 18 key action areas. This analysis was based on 
external studies, industry analyses and stakeholder surveys as well 
as internal policies and guidelines from our different divisions. 
These action areas were largely defined on the basis of the findings 
of expert workshops held in the past that addressed topics relating 
to the economy, the environment and civil society.
In the course of evaluating the statutory reporting requirements, 
Volkswagen expanded its materiality analysis in 2017 and revised 
the action areas in terms of the requirements of the CSR Directive 
Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). In line with CSR-RUG, this nonfi-
nancial report will concentrate on those action areas that are nec-
essary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s business 
development, overall performance and position as well as the 
Volkswagen Group’s influence on nonfinancial aspects. Based on 
an analysis carried out in the 2018 reporting period, the action ar-
eas identified during the 2017 materiality analysis continue to 
 apply. The review of the materiality analysis started in 2018 will 
continue in 2019.

CREATING TRUST IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
We report selected environmental data as regards production 
 within the Volkswagen Group. The data is collected, checked and 
approved at our production sites in line with an internal standard 
(VW Standard 98 000). The values for December of the preceding 
year may include some estimated data if, for example, they are 
based on bills from power suppliers or waste disposal providers 
which were not yet available at the time of compilation. In the next 
data collection round, this estimated data will be replaced with the 
finalized figures for December.
In accordance with our environmental strategy, the various time 
series portrayed here refer to the baseline year of 2010 and show 
comparisons to both the reporting period and the previous year. 
Overall, environmental data is collected from the Group’s produc-
tion sites. As in the Volkswagen Group’s Annual Report, data in the 
“Cars and light commercial vehicles” category is reported for 2010, 
2017 and 2018. Data for the brands Scania AB, MAN SE, Ducati 
 Motor Holding S.p.A. and VW Kraftwerk GmbH is reported in the 
“ Other divisions” category; the respective proportions are shown 
separately in the tables. Unless otherwise indicated, all the Group’s 
production sites, together with the power stations and boiler plants 
operated by Volkswagen AG in Wolfsburg, Kassel and Hanover in 
Germany, are included in both categories.
The data covers 117 of the Group’s 123 production sites. No data is 
available for six Scania Regional Product Centers. These correspond 
to approximately 0.1% of the workforce at the production sites, 
hence have no relevant influence on the Group’s KPIs.
The Volkswagen Group is essentially an automotive manufacturer 
which produces cars and light commercial vehicles as well as 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles and buses. MAN SE does, however, 
also manufacture marine engines and power station components. 
In view of this product diversity, our overall environmental impact 
cannot simply be expressed in terms of the volume of vehicles pro-
duced.
Consequently, relative indicators are only shown for the “Cars and 
light commercial vehicles” category. The number of vehicles pro-
duced in 2018 totaled 10,787,245 cars and light commercial vehicles 
as well as 230,376 heavy-duty commercial vehicles.
The changing production volumes and associated fluctuations in 
capacity utilization levels at our various locations are reflected in 
changes in the absolute values of many indicators. However, in-
creased efficiency did result in improvements in the specific values 
of a number of indicators.
Weather conditions have an appreciable but uncontrollable impact 
on the consumption of resources. This relates primarily to space 
heating demand for both production and non-production areas, 
since the annual average temperatures impact the direct consump-
tion of energy sources as well as the amount of energy purchased 
from third parties.
The specific values are also influenced by a range of factors. On the 
one hand, absolute consumption or emissions levels may change, 
while on the other, rising or falling production volumes at the indi-
vidual production sites also influence the indicators.

 GRI CONTENT INDEX
This report was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards, 
 applying the “comprehensive” option. On behalf of the Materiality 
Disclosures Service, GRI Services verified that the GRI content 
 index is well structured and that disclosures for 102-40 to 102-49 
match the corresponding chapters in the report.
At the same time, we show how we are implementing the require-
ments of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and are using 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as well as the criteria of 
the German Sustainability Code (DNK) as guidance. 
Statements and references in the index refer to fiscal year 2018

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE 
ENGAGEMENT ON NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1 
¹  PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined separate non-financial report and issued an independent assurance report in 
German  language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent assurance report.
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the com-
bined separate non-financial report pursuant to §§ (Articles) 289b 
Abs. (paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: 
“German Commercial Code”) of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, (here-
inafter the “Company”) for the period from 1 January 2018 to  
31  December 2018 which comprises the text sections, tables and 
 diagrams marked with a colored background in the Group Sustain-
ability Report 2018 of the Company (hereinafter the “Non-financial 
Report”). 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315b 
and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB and the principles 
stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global 
 Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the “GRI-Criteria”).
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the 
selection and application of appropriate methods of non-financial 
reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to 
individual non-financial disclosures which are reasonable in the 
circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsi-
ble for such internal controls as they have considered necessary to 
enable the preparation of a Non-financial Report that is free from 
material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL OF THE AUDIT FIRM
We have complied with the German professional provisions regard-
ing independence as well as other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and profes-
sional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German 
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung 
für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as 
well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut 
der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; 
IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW Quali-
tätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualitätssiche-
rung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW QS 1) – and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
PRACTITIONER´S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on 
the Non-financial Report based on the assurance engagement we 
have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement, we did not perform an audit 
on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to 
in the Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Re-
vised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This 
Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engage-
ment to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Compa-
ny’s Non-financial Report for the period from 1 January 2018 to 
31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in 
accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e 
HGB and the relevant GRI-Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are 
less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The 
assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judg-
ment. 
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed 
amongst others the following assurance procedures and further ac-
tivities:
• Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustain-
ability organization and of the conduction of the materiality 
analysis
• Inquiries of relevant managerial personnel involved in the 
preparation of the Non-financial Report regarding the prepara-
tion process, the internal control system relating to this process 
and selected disclosures in the Non-financial Report
• Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the 
Non-financial Report
• Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the Non-financial 
Report
• Evaluation of the implementation of group management re-
quirements, processes and specifications regarding data collec-
tion through on-site visits at selected sites and brands of the 
VW Group
• Volkswagen AG (Wolfsburg, Germany)
• Audi México, S.A. de C.V. (San José Chiapa, Mexico)

ny’s management report
• Evaluation of the presentation of the information
ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
Based on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evi-
dence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the Company’s Non-financial Report for the period 
from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 has not been prepared, 
in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in con-
junction with 289b to 289e HGB and the relevant GRI-criteria.
INTENDED USE OF THE ASSURANCE REPORT
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with 
the Company. The assurance engagement has been performed for 
purposes of the Company and the report is solely intended to in-
form the Company about the results of the limited assurance en-
gagement. 
The report is not intended for any third parties to base any (finan-
cial) decision thereon. Our responsibility lies only with the Compa-
ny. We do not assume any responsibility towards third parties.

FOREWORD
Ladies and gentlemen,
The automotive industry is in a state of deep upheaval. We are fueling the system change 
to e-mobility – not least in order to deliver new answers for environmental and climate 
protection.
The Volkswagen Group was the first automotive manufacturer globally to commit to the 
Paris Agreement. We are taking responsibility and making our contribution to keeping 
global warming below two degrees Celsius with a reference year of 2050. We have therefore 
launched our industry’s largest decarbonization offensive. 
The intention is for the entire Volkswagen Group to be carbon neutral by 2050. This in-
cludes our fleet and our entire Group. We are guided by binding intermediate goals along 
the way. In this way, we want to reduce our passenger car fleet’s total life-cycle carbon 
 footprint by 30% by 2025. Our target is to halve our plants’ global CO2 emissions.
This year, we have come a long way towards achieving our targets. Every vehicle is now 
manufactured in a 36% more environmentally friendly way than in 2010. We are also fully 
focusing our fleet on the electric vehicle. This is the best and most efficient option for less 
CO2 in road traffic for the foreseeable future. Around 75 new e-models are planned to come 
onto the market in the next ten years.

Audi has already introduced the e-tron, and Porsche the Taycan. Mass production of the 
Volkswagen ID.3, the world’s first electric vehicle with a carbon-neutral footprint, has 
 started in Zwickau.
In addition, we invest in new business models in order to fuel the penetration of electric 
vehicles. “WeShare”, our new carsharing service in Berlin and Hamburg, started this year. 
The fleet consists entirely of battery vehicles fueled by green power. The service will be 
 expanded to numerous cities in Europe in 2020.
The Volkswagen Group is comprehensively driving the change. This is also underlined by 
our new rating system in procurement. It commits suppliers to clean production processes 
and to respecting human and codetermination rights. In addition, we have enshrined the 
topic of business and human rights in our compliance management system and set clear 
standards.
Moreover, our Group-wide Together4Integrity program and our Code of Conduct lay the 
foundation for conduct in the Volkswagen Group that is honest, ethically correct and has 
integrity.
We are making new alliances with industrial corporations, such as Ford, Microsoft, or 
 Amazon. We also have new project partners, such as Permian Global, who support us in 
protecting and restoring tropical forests.
This diversity enriches our work. At the same time it challenges us. Mediating between the 
different demands, expectations and attitudes requires dialog. Our sustainability report 
makes an important contribution to this. It follows the guidelines of the Global Reporting 
Initiative, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. It  also 
represents our Communication on Progress under the United Nations Global Compact and 
serves as our Nonfinancial Declaration under the German CSR Directive Implementation Act.
We look forward to receiving your suggestions and feedback!
Best regards,
Dr. Herbert Diess

DECARBONIZATION
DECARBONIZATION – ON THE PATH TO BECOMING CARBON 
NEUTRAL
Climate change is one of humanity’s key challenges. The speed of 
global warming has rapidly increased in the last three decades. 
Stopping it is an obligation for us all. Society accuses politicians 
and businesses, including the Volkswagen Group, of lacking will-
ingness to act on climate protection issues. The global Fridays for 
Future movement constantly repeats this criticism – and emphati-
cally so. The major public response shows that the attitude and de-
mands of the movement are supported by large sections of the 
population.
According to the calculations of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC), the transport sector accounts for around 
14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In the EU, this is the only 
area in which greenhouse gas emissions have increased in recent 
years. We are aware of our responsibility as one of the world’s larg-
est automotive manufacturers and mobility providers. In concrete 
terms, over their entire life cycles, our products alone (passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles) are responsible for about 1% of 
the total global CO2 emissions produced.

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY 
We do not just take responsibility for this, we are also actively tak-
ing action because we want to go from part of the problem to part 
of the solution. That is why we have launched a comprehensive de-
carbonization program and want to use it to make our contribution 
to achieving the two-degree target in the Paris Agreement, or even 
to come in significantly below this target – if possible. The entire 
Volkswagen Group wants to be a carbon-neutral organization by 
2050 at the latest. That extends from the fleet through production to 
administration. We want to improve our passenger cars’ total life- 
cycle carbon footprint by 30% compared to 2015 by as early as 2025. 
This means we are going far beyond legal and political requirements 
and are taking on a pioneering role in our industry. This is our new 
identity. 
The key is the consistent electrification of our vehicle fleet, opening 
up the way to sustainable, emission-free mobility for our custom-
ers. We plan to invest around €33 billion in this Group-wide by 
2024. However, electric mobility only makes a contribution to cli-
mate change when we optimize the carbon footprint over the en-
tire life cycle. That is why we particularly have an eye on the supply 
chain, manufacture and supplying the vehicles with green electric-
ity in our decarbonization program.

The decarbonization of the Group not only means we are living up 
to our responsibility as one of the world’s leading mobility busi-
nesses, but also opens up new potential and competitive advantag-
es for us. In this way, we meet the growing requirements of a wide 
variety of stakeholders and lay the foundation for products that in-
spire people all over the world. This ensures our future and success. 
Decarbonization thus strengthens the value of our Group and is an 
important instrument for providing for climate-related risks that 
could threaten our business model. Responsible handling of these 
risks has become a decisive factor for assessing companies, particu-
larly from the perspective of investors and shareholders. 
We consider it our responsibility to actively participate in shaping 
the framework for our economic activity – i.e. also the framework 
for the decarbonization of our business – in politics and civil society 
in dialog with our stakeholders. In the process, we ensure consistent 
communication of all brands and companies (“One Voice Policy”), 
including in associations. 
We cannot achieve this system change alone – the interconnection 
of the sectors means that a successful transportation transforma-
tion only works with a successful energy transformation. Decar-
bonization in the energy and transportation sector is strongly de-
pendent on the political environment. The greater common goal 
therefore needs cooperation and new alliances. The Group contrib-
uted its position on the political framework for carbon-neutral 
companies both nationally and internationally in a direct and indi-
rect representation of interests in 2019: the key success factor for 
the Group’s decarbonization strategy is the integration of renewa-
ble energy sources into all value creation stages. Cross-sector pricing 
of CO2 would provide a suitable framework with which individual 
countries, coalitions of countries and the international communi-
ty economically can optimize and safely achieve their climate tar-
gets overall. A more detailed description and positions on addition-
al topics are also available online.

MAKING DECARBONIZATION MEASURABLE
We support our decarbonization program with concrete, verifiable 
targets and measures. It is based on three key principles, which at 
the same time represent a setting of priorities: the top priority are 
measures with which CO2 emissions can be avoided or reduced. In 
second place come measures with which we can shift the energy 
supply in the entire value chain to less CO2-intensive energy and/or 
renewable energy. Finally, we offset unavoidable CO2 emissions 
through climate protection projects that meet the highest interna-
tional standards.
Our decarbonization index (DCI) is an informative measurement tool 
that makes our progress and intermediate results in this area pub-
lic and verifiable. The DCI is calculated based on the CO2 emissions 
of the major brands that manufacture passenger cars and of light 
commercial vehicles of the Europe (EU-28, Norway and Iceland), 
China and USA regions over the entire life cycle. By 2025, it should 
fall by 30% compared to the baseline of 2015. The DCI value was 
43.0 t CO2e/vehicle in the reporting year. In 2019, all production lo-
cations as well as the brands and regions created decarbonization 
roadmaps, which were incorporated into a Group decarbonization 
roadmap.  
 
 The Environment > Climate Protection
The degree of achievement of our targets is measured with a track-
ing system. If we temporarily miss the target, we will implement 
corrective measures. Our program’s first measures were already be-
ing taken in 2019. These include the compulsory use of renewable 
energy sources in the manufacture of batteries by suppliers, con-
verting power stations from coal to natural gas, customer offers for 
green electricity for e-vehicles, measures for battery recycling and 
the production of the new ID.3 electric car.
REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE
One reason that achieving our CO2 reduction target is ambitious is 
because we relate our reduction targets to the vehicle’s entire life 
cycle and thus also to areas that we can only in part directly influ-
ence ourselves. Our potential for direct action for carbon-neutral 
mobility resides in emission-free production, including the up-
stream supply chain, and vehicles that do not create emissions in 
use. Indirectly, we can have an influence by creating offerings for 
the use of green electricity for battery charging and a green, effi-
cient charging infrastructure. When implementing our decarboni-
zation program, we crucially need the cooperation of our suppliers 
and of energy suppliers and also behavior changes from our 
customers.
BATTERY MANUFACTURING CHALLENGE
We are tackling the challenge that higher CO2 emissions initially 
arise in the supply chain during the transition to electric mobility. 
The CO2 emissions in manufacturing an electric vehicle are – from 
raw material extraction to handover to the customer – roughly 
twice as high as with a vehicle with a combustion engine. This is 
because of the difficulty of raw material extraction and the ener-
gy-intensive processes in manufacturing batteries. In particular, 
drying the raw materials, which are applied to a carrier film in liq-
uid form, causes energy consumption to rocket.
However, we are increasing efficiency in big steps here: the first ID. 
model will already emit around 50% less CO2 per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
of battery capacity than the current e-Golf – as a result of improved 
battery technologies and the manufacture of the battery with green 
electricity. All battery suppliers are contractually obliged to use certi-
fied green electricity in their production. Suppliers must provide 
proof of this before the award of the contract. CO2 emissions in bat-
tery manufacturing are thus falling significantly. 
We founded a 50/50 joint venture with the Swedish company 
Northvolt AB in 2019 to set up a factory for the production of 
 lithium-ion batteries. The plan is to build the plant in Salzgitter 
10
from 2020. Production should start at around the end of 2023/begin-
ning of 2024. The annual performance of the battery factory to begin 
with should be 16 gigawatt hours.
The use of new technologies in the context of the consistent expan-
sion of our fleet with electric vehicles is leading, among other things, 
to a change in the composition of the vehicle and a greater need for 
raw materials such as cobalt and lithium, the extraction and pro-
cessing of which may be associated with increased human rights 
challenges. In close collaboration with our battery cell suppliers, we 
are therefore pursuing the objective of creating complete supply 
chain transparency, from mining the raw materials to manufactur-
ing the finished product. We are continuously increasing transpar-
ency in our supply chain through various collaborations, audits 
and the piloting of new technologies, such as blockchain. From our 
perspective, in particular a sustainable and responsibly organized 
supply chain is also a key success factor for the global acceptance of 
electric mobility.
 
 Responsibility > Supply Chain
ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND LOW-EMISSION PRODUCTION 
Part of our decarbonization program is to reduce the CO2 emissions 
per vehicle of all plants by 50% by 2025 compared to 2010. We are 
also introducing absolute CO2 targets at the same time: by 2030, the 
Group sites should emit 16% less CO2 in absolute terms compared 
to the base year of 2018. The key to this is increasing energy effi-
ciency and raising the proportion of renewable energies in our elec-
tricity supply. Globally, renewable energies account for 41% of elec-
tricity consumption in the Volkswagen Group. 100% of electricity is 
already obtained from renewable energy at 43 Group sites.
Audi’s manufacturing in Brussels has already been made carbon 
neutral throughout. For the production of the ID.3, the Volkswagen 
plant in Zwickau is currently being converted into one of the first, 
largest, most efficient and most environmentally friendly e-plants 
in Europe. In particular, the focus is on the reduction of CO2 emis-
sions, for example through purchasing green energy. This by itself 
reduces CO2 emissions by nearly 90,000 tonnes per year.
With our zero impact factory initiative, as part of our “goTOzero” 
environmental mission statement we will take decisive steps in the 
future towards automotive manufacturing with zero impact on the 
environment. As well as resource efficiency and a circular econo-
my, in particular climate protection with a carbon-neutral energy 
supply is at the top of the agenda. 
 
  The Environment > Commitment to an Undamaged 
Environment
E-MOBILITY AS A KEY FACTOR
The Volkswagen Group is further advancing a radical system 
change in individual mobility and consistently focusing on electric 
powertrains. Compared to vehicles with an internal combustion 
engine, electric vehicles have less of an impact on the environment, 
as they produce no local emissions during use. Our calculations 
show that the carbon footprint of electric vehicles today is already 
better over the entire life cycle too. A current Volkswagen Golf with a 
gasoline engine driven in the European market emits 172 g CO2/km 
over its entire life cycle when it is driven 200,000 kilometers; the 
corresponding Golf TDI (diesel) on average emits 140 g CO2/km – 
and the e-Golf only emits 119 g CO2/km.
An electric vehicle’s CO2 advantage compared to an internal com-
bustion engine is further increased by the decarbonization pro-
gram’s CO2 reduction measures. These include measures to reduce 
CO2 in the supply chain, especially in battery production, and the 
integration of renewable energy sources into the value chains. 
The Volkswagen Group intends to launch almost 70 new electric 
models on the market in the next ten years – instead of 50 as previ-
ously planned. This means a rise in the number of electric vehicles 
projected for the next decade that are to be built on the Group’s 
e-platforms from 15 million to 22 million. The proportion of the 
fleet that is electric should rise to at least 40% by 2030. As early as 
this year, the first new generation of electric cars will go into 
production.
In the future, the new electric cars will be made at eight locations in 
Europe, China and the USA – on the basis of the modular electric drive 
matrix. The associated economies of scale will allow the cost of 
e-mobility to be significantly reduced. This means individual mo-
bility will be affordable and usable for many people in the future.
We are also systematically integrating electric mobility into forward- 
looking mobility concepts in urban areas that offer our customers 
connected and environmentally friendly services irrespective of 
whether they own their own vehicle. These include, for example, 
MOIA in the field of ride sharing or WeShare in the carsharing seg-
ment.  The vehicle fleet will be fully electric in both cases.
CLIMATE-NEUTRAL VEHICLE USE
Electric mobility is only truly sustainable when the electric vehicle 
is used with CO2-free energy when driven. Through the subsidiary 
Elli (Electric Life), the Group offers 100% CO2-free Volkswagen 
Naturstrom electricity to private households and companies with or 
without electric vehicles in Germany. It is generated by wind, solar 
and hydroelectric power plants in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
D E C A R B O N I Z AT I O N
11
With the market launch of the ID.3, Elli is gradually establishing a 
portfolio of smart charging solutions by the start of 2020 that ex-
tends from hardware through billing and additional digital servic-
es to complete consulting packages. These include wall boxes, 
charging stations, IT-based energy management systems and cus-
tomer cards for charging out and about.
This means Elli is tapping a completely new field of business for the 
Group, in which the energy and car focus areas grow closer togeth-
er via electric mobility. Our aim is to make Elli the first provider on 
the market to offer drivers and fleet managers of electric vehicles a 
seamless and holistic charging and energy experience. In order to 
further strengthen electric mobility, Volkswagen and partners 
from industry will set up 400 fast-charging stations on major high-
ways by 2020 with the IONITY project. 
SAVING CO2 BY RECYCLING 
Used batteries from electric vehicles should not be treated as haz-
ardous waste, instead they can serve as a valuable source of raw 
materials and contribute to the reduction of emissions. Batteries 
that are fundamentally still intact, but no longer provide full power 
for use in electric cars can be used as energy storage units in charg-
ing stations. Completely dead batteries need to be recycled. To this 
end, Volkswagen Group Components in Salzgitter is setting up a pi-
lot facility for battery recycling. From 2020 onward, up to 3,000 bat-
teries per year can be recycled in it. For example, a new raw materi-
al (black powder) can be extracted for the cathodes of new batteries. 
This results in CO2 saving potential of up to 25%. In the long term, 
we want to expand this and further improve recovery.
OFFSETTING UNAVOIDABLE CO2 EMISSIONS 
By reducing CO2 emissions and offsetting unavoidable emissions, 
we want to ensure that the ID.3 has a carbon-neutral footprint 
when handed over to the customer. We offset unavoidable CO2 
emissions through climate protection projects with the highest 
certification standards, such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), 
the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB) or the 
Gold Standard. For the quality assurance of offsetting projects, we 
have developed a comprehensive scoring model and rate the proj-
ects with regard to compliance with standards, credibility, site se-
lection, project size and the contribution to achieving the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We focus on three types of projects: forest protection and reforesta-
tion in tropical regions to support the maintenance and expansion 
of indispensable carbon sinks, and the establishment of renewable 
energy plants. First we support active forest protection and reforest-
ation, particularly in the tropics. With the first project, the Katingan 
Mataya Forest Protection Project on the Indonesian island of Borneo, 
the Group offsets the currently still unavoidable CO2 emissions from 
the supply chain, manufacturing and delivery of the new Volkswagen 
electric vehicle ID.3 and further emissions from other areas. 
In 2019, we launched a comprehensive program for supporting cli-
mate protection projects and invested nearly half a million euros in 
offsetting unavoidable CO2 emissions. For the next reporting year, 
we plan to massively expand our involvement in climate protection 
projects. The measures can be in all phases of the life cycle. One im-
portant criterion for this support: the CO2 saving must be precisely 
quantified and provable. A committee of members of top manage-
ment makes the decision on supporting the projects.

¹ Decarbonization index (DCI), up to and including 2020, European feet legislation will be complied with on the basis of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The DCI’s European feet emissions have 
therefore been calculated on the basis of the NEDC. From 2021, the NEDC target value will be changed into a WLTP target value through a process defned by lawmakers. When the target values change in 
2021, the DCI’s European feet emissions will also be calculated in accordance with the WLTP, as a result of which feet emissions in Europe are expected to rise by around 20%.

Climate change is one of the current key global challenges. In light 
of this, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) was set up by the G20’s Financial Stability Board. Its rec-
ommendations create a coherent framework for voluntary and 
consistent reporting of an entity’s climate-related financial risks 
and opportunities. The current Volkswagen Group Sustainability 
Report for the first time includes a reference table here with the 
five topics recommended by the TCFD: governance, strategy, risk 
management, key indicators and targets.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups in 
the automotive industry. The Group’s business activities comprise 
the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All brands within 
the Automotive Division – with the exception of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands – are 
independent legal entities.
The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Commercial 
Vehicles and Power Engineering business areas. The Passenger Cars 
Business Area essentially consolidates the Volkswagen Group’s pas-
senger car brands and the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand. 
Activities focus on the development of vehicles and engines, the 
production and sale of passenger cars and light commercial vehi-
cles, and the genuine parts business. The product portfolio extends 
from small cars through to luxury vehicles in the premium seg-
ment, and also includes motorcycles, and will gradually be supple-
mented by mobility services. 
The Commercial Vehicles Business Area primarily comprises the 
development, production and sale of trucks and buses from the 
Scania and MAN brands, the corresponding genuine parts business 
and related services. The commercial vehicles portfolio ranges from 
light vans to heavy trucks and buses. The collaboration between 
the two commercial vehicle brands is coordinated in TRATON SE, 
which has been listed on the stock exchange since mid-2019. 
The Power Engineering Business Area combines the large-bore diesel 
engines, turbomachinery, special gear units, propulsion components 
and testing systems businesses. 
The activities of the Financial Services Division comprise dealer 
and customer financing, vehicle leasing, direct banking and insur-
ance activities, as well as fleet management and mobility offerings. 
With its brands, the Volkswagen Group is present in all relevant 
markets around the world. The key sales markets currently include 
Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, Russia, Mexico and Poland.  
Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group are managed by the 
Volkswagen AG Board of Management in accordance with the 
Volkswagen AG Articles of Association and the rules of procedure 
for Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management issued by the Supervi-
sory Board. 
In addition to the Finance & IT, Human Resources and Integrity 
and Legal Affairs divisions, the Volkswagen Group collaborates 
across six operating units and the China region, these being the 
“Volume”, “Premium”, “Sport & Luxury”, “Truck & Bus” brand 
groups, as well as the Components & Procurement and Financial 
Services operating units. The “Volume” brand group comprises the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, SEAT, ŠKODA and Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles brands. The Audi, Lamborghini and Ducati brands 
are brought together in the “Premium” brand group. “Sport & Lux-
ury” is comprised of the Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti brands. The

“Truck & Bus” brand group is the umbrella for the Scania and MAN 
brands. Components & Procurement will function as one unit span-
ning all of the brands and supporting them. The Financial Services 
business has been combined into a single unit. We are convinced 
that this management model will allow better use of existing ex-
pertise and economies of scale, boost synergy effects more system-
atically and accelerate decision making. In addition, this prepares the 
Volkswagen Group for a management structure that is simpler, leaner 
and more effective, and strengthens the brands, giving them more 
autonomy. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, decisions will be 
taken at the lowest competent level, close to business operations.
At the same time, spreading the Group’s management duties more 
broadly means that responsibility is assigned more clearly and de-
finitively. Every member of the Board of Management has assumed 
additional higher-level duties for the Group. At the same time, the 
members of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG have re-
sponsibility for a brand group or operating unit, thus improving 
collaboration between the brands and the Group as a whole and en-
suring that management of the Group is a shared undertaking. 
Each brand within the Volkswagen Group is managed by a brand 
board of management, which ensures the brand’s independent and 
self-contained development and business operations. To the extent 
permitted by law, the board adheres to the Group targets and require-
ments laid down by the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, 
as well as with the agreements in the brand groups. This allows 
Group-wide interests to be pursued, while at the same time safe-
guarding and reinforcing each brand’s specific characteristics. Mat-
ters that are of importance to the Group as a whole are submitted 
to the Group Board of Management to be agreed upon, to the ex-
tent permitted by law. The rights and obligations of the statutory 
bodies of the relevant brand company remain unaffected.
The Volkswagen Group companies are managed solely by their re-
spective managements. The management of each individual com-
pany takes into account not only the interest of its own company 
but also the interests of the Group, the relevant brand group and 
the individual brands in accordance with the framework laid down 
by law. 
At Group level, committees also address key strategic issues, for ex-
ample relating to product planning, investments, risks management 
and management issues. Some of the committees were optimized 
in the reporting year in order to improve the efficiency of their de-
cision making. This has reduced complexity and reinforced gov-
ernance within the Group. 
The Best Governance module of our future program TOGETHER 
2025+, which was newly enhanced over the course of the fiscal year, 
is also fostering our Company’s transformation. One of its aims is 
to further improve manageability of the Group and to make even 
better use of synergy effects.
PRODUCTION LOCATIONS
GRI 102-7
The Volkswagen Group’s production network is comprised of 124 
locations in which passenger cars, commercial vehicles and motor-
cycles, as well as powertrains and components are manufactured.
With 72 locations, Europe remains our most important production 
region for vehicles and components. There are 28 sites in Germany 
alone. The Asia-Pacific region has 33 locations. We have six locations 
in North America and nine in South America. The Group operates 
four locations in Africa.

THE VOLKSWAGEN VALUE CHAIN
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Year for year, the Volkswagen Group invests more in research and development than any other automotive company in the world, laying the 
foundations for new models and innovative concepts with which to master the challenges of the future: digitalization, networking and electric 
mobility (e-mobility).
PROCUREMENT
Every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, components and other goods. A sustainable supply chain and 
 environmentally compatible transportation play key roles in our responsible and comprehensive championing of human rights, environmental 
protection and the battle against corruption.
PRODUCTION
Every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of 36,000 vehicles globally. Efficient production ranks alongside employee 
health and safety as one of our core goals.
MARKETING & SALES
The Volkswagen Group markets its vehicles in 153 countries. Around the world, comfort and safety are considered the key customer 
 requirements. Business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term and stable partnerships. The Volkswagen Group’s share 
of  commercial fleet customers is 44.1% in Germany and 25.6% in the rest of Europe.
AFTER-SALES & FINANCIAL SERVICES
Our service provision includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality advice and maintenance, managing our original parts 
business, and providing innovative vehicle-related financial services. 
RECYCLING
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ impact on the environment and conserving resources. This is not just about 
 recycling vehicles at the end of their useful life; recycling starts at the new-vehicle development stage, during which we pay close attention 
to the recyclability of the required materials, the use of high-quality recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants.

GOALS AND STRATEGIES
With the future-oriented program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 an-
nounced in 2016, we are seeking to make the Volkswagen Group 
more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented and sustain-
able, and systematically geared toward generating profitable 
growth.
 We at the Volkswagen Group have set ourselves the goal of contin-
uing to excite our customers in future and meeting their diverse 
needs with an appealing product portfolio of impressive vehicles 
and forward-looking, tailor-made mobility solutions. Every day, we 
actively assume and exercise responsibility in relation to the envi-
ronment, safety and society, and we aim to be a role model in these 
areas. Integrity, reliability, quality and passion thus form the basis 
for our work. Using this approach, we aim for technological leader-
ship in the industry and competitive profitability while also striv-
ing to be an excellent employer.
In summer 2019, we further enhanced our program for the future 
with TOGETHER 2025+. We are increasing the momentum for 
achieving our strategic targets and sharpening our focus. To this 
end, the strategic vision of the Volkswagen Group was also revised. 
With “Shaping mobility – for generations to come”, we aim to more 
actively shape the future of mobility while safeguarding it sustain-
ably – for present and future generations. 
With electric drives, digital connectivity and autonomous driving, 
we want to make the automobile cleaner, more quiet, more intelli-
gent and safer. At the same time, our core product will become 
more emotive and offer a completely new driving experience. In 
this way, the car can continue to be a cornerstone of sustainable, in-
dividual and affordable mobility in the future. In addition, we are 
committed to the Paris Agreement on climate protection and are 
one of the first companies in our industry to commit ourselves to 
the zero-emissions target by 2050 at the latest. 
The automotive industry is being shaped particularly by the trans-
formation to e-mobility and digitalization. We have positioned our-
selves to successfully tackle this radical change: the strategies of 
our brands and regions as well as those of our functional areas are 
consistently aligned with the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy.
Under the umbrella of the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, we 
have defined five central modules that incorporate many of our ex-
isting Group initiatives. With this change, we are putting the focus 
on corporate governance, improved performance, increased brand 
values, software and excellence in employee management. 
Our Code of Collaboration, along with our integrity and compli-
ance program Together4Integrity (T4I), is a central pillar of the 
Group strategy. This Code describes how collaboration is to take 
place within the Group and between individuals in their day-to-day 
work. Its core values are encapsulated in the terms “genuine”, 
“straightforward”, “open-minded”, “as equals” and “united”. T4I 
brings together all activities relating to integrity, culture, compli-
ance, risk management and human resources, creating a common 
path toward a new corporate culture.
FIVE MODULES OF THE TOGETHER 2025+ STRATEGY 
Our revised TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy comprises consistent 
strategic decisions and specific modules aimed at safeguarding the 
long-term future of the Group and generating profitable growth.
These modules include Best Governance, Best Performance, Best 
Brand Equity, Software-enabled Car Company and Excellent Lead-
ership. We continuously review the status and progress of these ini-
tiatives in order to analyze the target achievement, importance and 
suitability of the measures defined. This enables us to tailor these 
modules to the transformation underway within our company. In 
the Best Governance module, we are working to create a focused, 
streamlined corporate structure to manage the brands, continually 
leverage synergies and accelerate decision-making processes. We 
want the Group to be perceived as efficiently managed, trustwor-
thy, sustainable and transparent. To this end, we are intensifying 
the dialog with our key stakeholders and systematically reviewing 
whether we are still the best owner for our various brands and 
companies. In addition, we want to make our CO2 targets measura-
ble and make our progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 
2050 transparent.
The aim of the Best Performance module is to achieve a sustainable 
increase in our enterprise value by increasing efficiency, productiv-
ity and profitability. As a global company, our size enables us to 
make even more efficient use of economies of scale. We remain 
firmly committed to our ambitious targets, work consistently on 
achieving them and strive to exceed them. This will lay the founda-
tions for extensive investment in our Company, in our employees 
and in mobility for present and future generations.
In the Best Brand Equity module, the focus is on realigning and fur-
ther refining the brand portfolio, making a significant increase in 
the value of our Group brands possible by 2025. The profile and 
mission of each brand are being optimized and overlaps in market 
positioning reduced. Based on these optimizations, we will decide 
on the future design, product portfolio and services of each Group 
brand – using the needs of our customers as a starting point.
In the Software-enabled Car Company module, we are working to 
make software development one of the Volkswagen Group’s core 
competencies. To achieve this, we are pooling existing expertise, 
substantially strengthening our resources and establishing a dedi-
cated organizational unit. By 2025, all new vehicle models across 
the Group will be based on our own cross-brand software plat-
form. This approach will enable us to leverage synergies between 
the individual brands and vehicle projects. The aim is that the 
Volkswagen Group and its brands will stand not only for the best 
vehicles but in equal measure for exciting digital products and 
services. 
The Excellent Leadership module will accelerate the transforma-
tion to open, partnership-based, value-based leadership. Manage-
ment development and training will be radically reorganized and 
succession planning will be even more systematically pursued so

that the right talents always have the right positions in the Group 
at the right time. We are also defining clear expectations for the 
Group’s managers. These involve greater customer focus, more cor-
porate responsibility, greater effectiveness and focus on results as 
well as a culture of constructive dissent and a positive approach in 
dealing with mistakes. Volkswagen also wants to increase diversity 
at all levels of the company and is pursuing clear, measurable targets 
for raising the proportion of female and international managers.
GROUP STRATEGY GOALS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
The five strategic modules describe how we want to achieve our vi-
sion of sustainable mobility for present and future generations. We 
are managing our project using four target dimensions, which are 
also reflected in the Volkswagen strategy rhombus. The four target 
dimensions are excited customers; excellent employer; role model 
for the environment, safety and integrity; and competitive profita-
bility. We want to grow sustainably by consistently pursuing these 
objectives.
The target dimensions apply throughout the whole Group. The stra-
tegic KPIs that we use to measure how well we have implemented 
our Group strategy are dependent on the respective business mod-
el. After all, the business model for our passenger car-producing 
brands is different from the business model for trucks and buses 
and also differs from the business model for our Power Engineer-
ing Business Area and our services business.
The strategic KPIs of the competitive profitability target dimension 
have been defined and standardized. As the Group strategy is cur-
rently being revised and specified in detail, the content of some 
strategic KPIs in the other target dimensions is still being deter-
mined. The relevance of the KPIs is reviewed at Group level and 
their focus is continuously monitored and adjusted as necessary. 
We report on the defined nonfinancial strategic KPIs in the “Cor-
porate Governance Report” and “Sustainable Value Enhancement” 
sections of the Annual Report.
 
  Annual Report > Corporate Governance Report, 
Sustainable Value Enhancement
TARGET DIMENSION: EXCITED CUSTOMERS
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our custom-
ers and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to exceed our 
customers’ expectations, thus generating maximum customer 
benefit. This requires not only the best products, the most efficient 
solutions and the best service, but also flawless quality and an out-
standing image. We want to inspire enthusiasm in our existing cus-
tomers, win over new ones and retain their loyalty in the long 
term – because only loyal and faithful customers will recommend 
us to others.
The strategic KPIs consist of the conquest rate and KPIs pertaining 
to loyalty, customer satisfaction and quality.
TARGET DIMENSION: EXCELLENT EMPLOYER
To achieve sustainable success, we need skilled and dedicated em-
ployees. We aim to increase their satisfaction and motivation by 
means of equal opportunities, an attractive and modern working 
18
environment, and a forward-looking organization of work. An exem-
plary management and corporate culture forms the basis for this, 
allowing us to retain our core workforce and attract new talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension cover internal employer 
attractiveness determined by means of the opinion survey, exter-
nal employer attractiveness, an external employer ranking as well 
as the diversity index.
 
 People > Employer Attractiveness
TARGET DIMENSION: ROLE MODEL FOR ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY 
AND INTEGRITY
Every day, we at the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise respon-
sibility in issues relating to the environment, safety and society. 
This is reflected both in our thoughts and actions and in all our de-
cisions. We pay particular attention to the use of resources and the 
emissions of our product portfolio as well as those of our sites and 
plants. Our goal is to continuously reduce our carbon footprint 
and lower our pollutant emissions. Through innovations and out-
standing quality, we aim for maximum product safety. 
Our primary objectives in this process include complying with laws 
and regulations, establishing secure processes and dealing openly 
with mistakes so that they can be avoided or rectified in the future. 
In terms of integrity, Volkswagen aims to become a role model for a 
modern, transparent and successful enterprise.
The strategic KPIs for this target dimension include the decarboni-
zation index, CO2 fleet emissions as well as compliance, integrity 
and a culture of dealing openly with mistakes.
 
  The Environment > Commitment to an Undamaged 
Environment
TARGET DIMENSION: COMPETITIVE PROFITABILITY
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations 
as regards interest payments and debt repayments. As equity hold-
ers, they expect appropriate dividends and a long-term increase in 
the value of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth 
and strengthening our competitiveness, thus keeping the 
Volkswagen Group on a firm footing in the future and ensuring it 
remains an attractive investment option.
The goals we have set ourselves are operational excellence in all 
business processes and becoming the benchmark for the entire 
industry.
The strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with 
our business activities and taking a forward-thinking approach to 
managing them is crucial to our Group’s long-term success. A fore-
sighted risk management process and effective internal control 
systems are therefore vitally important to us. Not only do we set 
high internal standards, we also insist that all our suppliers along 
our entire value chain comply with these standards.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
A comprehensive risk management and internal control system 
(RMS/ICS) helps us to handle risks responsibly. It defines the prima-
ry principles and elements of our Group, forming the basis for the 
appropriate and effective management and control of material 
risks. This applies to risks with consequences for the Volkswagen 
Group and to risks for the environment and society.
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Organ-
izations of the Treadway Commission). Through a Group risk man-
agement policy, all business divisions and units are obliged to im-
plement an RMS/ICS. The Group Risk Management function 
supports the divisions by providing necessary training and partici-
pating in conceptual development. The Board of Management re-
ceives ad-hoc, quarterly and annual risk reports. 
The focus of our RMS/ICS is the three lines of defense model – a ba-
sic element required, among others, by the European Confedera-
tion of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). In line with this mod-
el, our RMS/ICS has three lines of defense that are designed to 
protect us from the occurrence of material risks.
• The first line of defense comprises the risk management and in-
ternal control systems at the individual Group companies and 
divisions. The RMS/ICS is an integral part of our Group’s organi-
zational structures and processes.
• The second line of defense is the Group Risk Management func-
tion, which sets standards for the RMS/ICS and coordinates the 
quarterly risk survey and annual governance, risk and compli-
ance (GRC) control process. It reports to the Group Board of Man-
agement on any material risks, which are defined in terms of 
quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria and given proba-
bility ratings.
• The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which carries 
out regular checks on the structure and implementation of the 
RMS as part of its independent audit activities.
INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
The Volkswagen Group continuously develops its risk management 
in order to take account of increased internal and external require-
ments in the field of corporate responsibility. This particularly ap-
plies to the instrument of the list of risk focus areas used by the 
Group, which is divided into 18 different modules. In 2019, it was 
checked whether the list of risk focus areas was up-to-date as neces-
sary and individual focus areas were moderately adjusted. In this 
way, in particular the assessment of compliance risks, environmen-
tal risks from operating processes and product characteristics as 
well as risks of noncompliance with human and employee rights 
has been further intensified.
The list of risk focus areas is to be used by all entities affected. The 
Group Risk Management function and the brand risk management 
units can declare selected areas of focus – including from the sus-
tainability, environment and compliance areas of focus – “manda-
tory” for the relevant units.
Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general en-
vironmental risks and climate-change risks. These include risks 
that could result from differing CO2 and emissions regulations, but 
also extreme weather, storms or floods with effects on production, 
infrastructure and supply chains. More detailed information is 
provided in the TCFD section.
 
 Introduction > Decarbonization
NONFINANCIAL RISKS
The Group risk management processes also take account of the 
risks for nonfinancial aspects in accordance with the CSR-Richtlinie- 
Umsetzungsgesetz (CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implemen-
tation Act). Here, we have assigned concrete risks from the list of 
focus areas to the individual matters as a priority.
• Environmental matters
 - Environmentally relevant risks from consequences of operat-
ing processes or product characteristics
 - Environmentally relevant risks from the use of materials and 
substances for production purposes or other operating 
purposes
• Employee matters
 - Personnel risks with regard to occupational safety and health
 - Risks from the use of employees from outside companies with-
in the framework of contracts for work and service contracts
• Social matters
 - Risks of noncompliance with social responsibility
 - Risks of violation of health and safety-related regulations
GRI 102-30, 102-31, 201-2

• Customer matters
 - Risks of violation of product-related regulations
 - Risks from product responsibility
• Respect for human rights
 - Risks of noncompliance with human rights
• Combating corruption and bribery
 - Risks of active corruption
 - Risks of passive corruption
 - Misappropriation and embezzlement risks
Relevant risks in the eyes of the Volkswagen Group including the 
risks relating to the six nonfinancial aspects that must be reported 
on are presented in the report on risks and opportunities in the 
management report. In fiscal year 2019, risks were identified with 
regard to CO2 compliance in individual brands and markets that 
very probably have or will have serious negative effects on the non-
financial aspect of environmental matters. A more detailed descrip-
tion is available in the Annual Report’s report on risks and opportu-
nities under the heading “Environmental Protection Regulations”.

INTEGRITY
In the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, we have set a major ob-
jective: to act as a model of integrity. Through the implementa-
tion of the Together4Integrity (T4I) program, we want to consis-
tently achieve this goal throughout the Group across all brands 
and companies and to strengthen corporate governance on integ-
rity and compliance. We have set ourselves the objective of the 
key performance indicators of integrity and compliance having 
the same strategic and operational priority as, for example, sales 
revenue, profit, product quality or employer attractiveness. T4I is 
thus one of the most extensive change programs in the history of 
the Group. The Integrity and Legal Affairs function of the Board 
of Management, under the leadership of Hiltrud D. Werner, is re-
sponsible for designing and implementing the program.
T4I WITH FOCUS ON GOVERNANCE AND CULTURE CHANGE
The program serves to provide the regulatory framework for act-
ing with integrity and in compliance with the rules – that is T4I’s 
governance dimension. In addition, T4I also has the dimension of 
culture change: to reach people and strengthen their own drive to 
act with integrity. For our employees, there is thus a stable frame-
work in which they can act responsibly, purposefully and entrepre-
neurially and contribute to Volkswagen having integrity through 
and through and being a respectable company in the best sense 
of the word.
The seven Group Essentials are the foundation of the culture 
change. These essentials define how we at Volkswagen want to 
work together and they supplement the Code of Conduct, which 
lays down the general rules of conduct, particularly with respect 
to compliance with the law and with internal guidelines.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Group > The Volkswagen Group 
Essentials
T4I’s methodological design follows the five fundamental and 
widely acknowledged principles of the international Ethics & 
Compliance Initiative (ECI). The principles relate to strategy, risk 
management, acting with integrity, a culture of open discussion 
and taking on responsibility, including in the case of misconduct. 
T4I specifically will put integrity and compliance in concrete terms 
for all five principles, with the intention of sustainably anchoring 
them in corporate practice. As a consistent umbrella program T4I 
combines the content of all the Group’s initiatives and its depart-
ments with respect to integrity and compliance.
An important factor for the success of T4I is a strong tone from the 
top, with which members of the Board of Management and top 
managers provide direction, reveal objectives and explain the rea-
sons for and advantages of the program. The protagonists here 
are both the members of the Group Board of Management and 
the members of the boards of management or managing direc-
tors of the individual companies who put the individual initia-
tives in the local frame of reference and authentically champion 
T4I as a project of their company’s own. Further support is provid-
ed by numerous dialog-oriented communication measures and 
event formats, for example, perception workshops, which actively 
involve employees across hierarchies and which employees can 
help shape.
However, T4I not only has an impact internally, but also beyond 
the Group: through the revision of the Code of Conduct for Busi-
ness Partners, through which we also commit our suppliers and 
sales partners to the principles of integrity and compliance. Fur-
thermore, the increasing focus on integrity and compliance, par-
ticularly in the Code of Conduct, also determines every employ-
ee’s interaction with customers, representatives of civil society, 
government bodies, authorities and other stakeholders.
IMPLEMENTING T4I THROUGHOUT THE GROUP
The program is to be rolled out to the roughly 700 operating busi-
ness units (legal entities) in which our more than 670,000 employ-
ees work by 2025. From the start in spring 2018 to the end of the 
2019 reporting period, the program has initially been rolled out to 
more than 200 business units, prioritized by size and risk profile, 
in order to achieve a far-reaching impact as quickly as possible. 
With around 491,000 employees, these business units represent 
more than two thirds of all the Volkswagen Group’s employees.
The core content of T4I is more than 100 packages of measures 
that must be independently implemented by every business unit. 
This is intended to create consistently robust systems and proc-
esses for avoiding compliance and integrity risks in all areas of 
activity – and should thus also eliminate the causes that fostered 
serious misconduct in the past. The packages of measures are 
grouped by topic into 11 key initiatives, for example on product 
compliance, on HR compliance and processes, on the whistle-
blower system or on Business Partner Due Diligence. One key ini-
tiative – the integrity program – is particularly focused on the 
topic of integrity. Regular reporting on how implementation of 
the particular key initiative is progressing ensures transparency 
about the progress made in implementation in the individual 
companies and thus creates the basis for quality assurance. The 
focus in the reporting year was on reaching people, raising their 
awareness and motivating them. To this end, we held T4I launch 
events and subsequently held T4I perception workshops. Both 
events are held in every business unit at the start of the imple-
mentation of T4I and involve both employees and managers 
across hierarchies as players in the change process. The joint de-
sign and implementation of these events increases awareness of 
each individual’s valuable contribution to the success of the change 
among participants. In addition, they offer the opportunity to ask 
openly critical questions and name problems.
The perception workshops are primarily about the actual practice 
of integrity and compliance – measured by the perception of em-
ployees. Here, representatively selected employees and managers 
give their assessment and discuss opportunities for improvement. 
In the reporting year, it became apparent that employees pre-
dominantly speak positively about the practice of integrity and 
compliance at each site: on average, more than 80% of survey 
GRI 404-3
24
respondents know the corporate values, for example. They know 
where they can report wrongdoing and agree with the statement 
that how managers behave is important to the Group. The work-
shops are repeated after around one year, partly in order to meas-
ure progress and identify any existing need for action.
At the end of the 2019 reporting year, 69 launch events with more 
than 8,000 participants had been held in 34 countries since the start 
of the program. In the same period, we have held 89 perception work-

T4I AS A COMPASS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING
The “integrity program” key initiative has the goal of increasing 
understanding of integrity and its importance as a basis of doing 
business among all the Volkswagen Group’s employees and manag-
ers and of creating a culture in which acting with integrity is not 
only consistently possible, but also seen as a matter of course. It is 
associated with encouraging the constructive handling of mistakes, 
increasing the transparency of reasons for decisions and strength-
ening willingness to also address aberrations and risks with man-
agers. Integrity is a core element of professional conduct for us and 
this is the only thing we aim for: to do the right thing in a given 
situation.
As the basis for running our business, integrity must impact all lev-
els. This means integrity is an obligatory criterion for all the Board 
of Management’s decisions: every submission to the Board of Man-
agement must include an opinion by the responsible department 
on the way in which the intended decision and its consequences 
are in line with the Group’s integrity and compliance or whether/
what integrity or compliance risks are associated with it and how 
they can be lessened. In the same way, integrity is also laid down as 
a criterion for decisions by the boards of management of the indi-
vidual Group brands and companies.
Whether it is possible for each individual to act with integrity is an 
explicit question in the Opinion Survey, the annual survey of all 
the Group’s employees. The question is: “In our organizational unit, 
is it possible for everyone to act with integrity”. If employees think 
this possibility is in doubt in a particular organizational unit, the 
relevant manager must identify and clear the possible obstacles to-
gether with the team. The question was asked in the Opinion Sur-
vey for the first time in 2017 and since then, including in the re-
porting year, has been one of the three questions with the highest 
level of agreement.
The conduct anchors were developed in order to breathe life into 
the concept of integrity and make clear to employees what acting 
with integrity in their day-to-day work means. They serve as practi-
cal guidelines for action and at the same time set a normative ex-
pectation regarding what is considered “correct conduct” in the 
Volkswagen Group. These defined “conduct anchors” will also form 
the frame of reference when integrity becomes an obligatory topic 
in employee appraisals from 2020.
INTEGRITY AS A MANAGEMENT TASK
As role models, managers are among the greatest factors influenc-
ing employee conduct. In order to further strengthen this function 
as a role model and further develop their skills, the Role Model Pro-
gram 2.0 was introduced in 2019 to encourage dialog-oriented and 
distance-reducing collaboration. The managers are to be equipped 
to ensure a culture of open discussion in their own team, where 
risks or conflicting objectives can be discussed without fear of 
sanctions and employees are encouraged to contribute their ques-
tions and ideas. Beyond their own conduct, however, managers also 
have the task of purposefully encouraging and demanding the 
right conduct among their employees. One of the ways in which 
support is given to them is through formats that are provided via 
the Opinion Survey method toolbox.
EMPLOYEES’ ACTIVE ROLE
Motivating our employees and spurring them to action is also criti-
cally important. The integrity program therefore ensures perma-
nent visibility of the topic through continuous communication 
both in employee media and in personal discussions. For example, 
information about the integrity program is regularly provided at 
works meetings, in individual departments, in the integrity work-
shops, in front of shop stewards or also vocational trainees. The T4I 
perception workshops are also used as platforms for discussing in-
tegrity and compliance. In addition, as the Director of Integrity and 
Legal Affairs, Hiltrud D. Werner regularly meets with employees 
from various departments on the dialog bus tour for direct discus-
sion about integrity-related challenges in day-to-day work.
However, the people who promote the topic of integrity of their 
own accord, who embed it within the structures of the Group and 
keep the topic alive – the integrity ambassadors – are also of key 
importance. It was possible to expand the network of them again in 
2019. The number of these voluntary disseminators at Volkswagen 
AG rose from 200 to more than 400. Worldwide there are already 
more than 700. This suggests an improved understanding and 
higher acceptance of the topic of integrity as well as greater willing-
ness by employees to openly address problematic aspects where 
necessary.
In selected departments, the integrity program also creates centers 
of excellence, which are used for in-depth, department-specific 
analysis of the topic of integrity. The change measures developed 
by employees are later reviewed to see if they can be transferred to 
other departments and, if suitable, are recommended Group-wide 
as best practices. In 2019, there were centers of excellence in Ger-
many, Italy, Spain, the USA and South Africa. The number of them 
has risen to a total of 26 since 2018.

ANCHORING INTEGRITY IN PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
Another focus of activities is the integration of integrity in as many 
HR processes as possible. For example, integrity has been a criteri-
on in the recruitment process and in staff development of manag-
ers since 2019. Integrity was also taken into account as a required 
component of performance-related remuneration from the Board 
of Management to management level. Training and presentation 
documents aimed at specific target groups are used to provide in-
formation for new and existing employees and ensure that they 
have the competence they need.
MEASURING PROGRESS WITH THE INTEGRITY INDEX
In addition to the Opinion Survey, we also use the integrity index 
in order to measure our progress in integrity and compliance. The 
index was developed in cooperation with the holder of the Peter 
Löscher Chair of Business Ethics at the Technical University of Mu-
nich (TUM) and comprehensively represents the integrity of an or-
ganization. We also use it as a key performance indicator in the 
Group initiatives on the “Excellent Leadership” module of the TO-
GETHER 2025+ strategy.
The index is cross-sectoral and global and of high scientific validity. 
It includes established frameworks such as the ECI and the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI). The index covers weaknesses in integrity 
and compliance matters and makes changes in the thinking and 
conduct of managers and employees visible.
We started the integrity index in 2019 as a pilot project for 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars Germany and AUDI AG (German sites). 
More than 100 measuring points in the compliance/infrastructure, 
working atmosphere/integrity culture, product/customers, society 
and partner/markets categories were collected and evaluated by 
Business Ethics experts. The analysis is based both on internal 
sources, such as employee surveys, guidelines and management in-
terviews, and on external data, such as international databases and 
interviews with experts.
Both the companies examined – Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
AUDI AG – exhibit a good integrity level overall. However, the de-
tailed results signal a need for action in various places. Following a 
decision by the Board of Management, the findings will now be 
used in a structured follow-up process in order to derive and imple-
ment improvement measures together with the departments. The 
aim is to raise the integrity level at the two pilot companies to the 
next level. This improvement is to be confirmed with the planned 
follow-up integrity index survey at Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
AUDI AG in the first quarter of 2021.
COMPLIANCE
COMPLIANCE ENSURES ADHERENCE TO RULES
Compliance with national and international laws and regulations, 
internal rules and voluntary commitments is among our Compa-
ny’s guiding principles as well as ensuring compliant behavior in 
a lasting manner. We are striving to strengthen the trust of our 
customers, our business partners and stakeholders in our Group 
through fair treatment. Compliant behavior is the basis for this 
and must be a matter of course for all Group employees. One of our 
Group’s main tasks at present is to further enhance awareness of 
this.

COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE IN THE GROUP
 
Our Group’s compliance organization supports and advises the 
Group and brand companies, helping them to conduct their busi-
ness activities in accordance with the rules and to consistently ad-
here to relevant laws and internal regulations. The focus of our 
compliance organization is on anti-corruption, breaches of trust 
and the prevention of money laundering. Furthermore, we have 
carried out an analysis on fraud prevention across all relevant sec-
ond lines of defense in the reporting year.
 
  2019 Annual Report > Report on Risks and Opportunities
One of the results of this analysis is that the topic of human rights 
will in the future also fall under the responsibility of our compli-
ance organization. At the moment, content-related, procedural and 
organizational preparations are being made in order to be able to 
successfully conclude the integration of the topic of business and 
human rights into the Volkswagen Group’s compliance manage-
ment system.
 
 Responsibility > Human Rights
Our global compliance organization is headed by the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Director of Integri-
ty and Legal Affairs and the Audit Committee of the Volkswagen 
AG Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the compliance organization 
is organized by division in the Group, which ensures communica-
tion and harmonized implementation of processes across all rele-
vant Group companies.
The divisional compliance officers are generally responsible for 
several brands (brand company group) and implement compliance 
measures in their area of responsibility. Porsche AG is an excep-
tion: the divisional compliance officers there are only responsible 
for their own brand. The Regional Compliance Officer is responsible 
for activities in China. The chief compliance officers are responsible 
for a brand and report to their competent senior management on 
disciplinary matters and to the divisional compliance officers on 
functional matters. The compliance officers report to the senior 
management responsible for them and manage one or more organ-
izational units operationally. They support management in the dif-
ferent companies to identify, assess, manage and monitor compli-
ance risks and to take suitable action to counter these.
The Group Compliance Committee – a committee on a top manage-
ment level chaired by the Director of Integrity and Legal Affairs – 
ensures that compliance and integrity standards are developed, ap-
plied and communicated in a standardized manner across divisions 
and brands. Communication between the Group and brand compli-
ance managers and networking take place through regular meetings 
and conferences. Our compliance management system is aligned 
with national and international laws and standards.
CLEAR RULES THROUGH THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND GROUP 
POLICIES
The Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct is the key instrument for 
strengthening employees’ awareness of correct behavior, giving 
employees support and guidance, and finding the right contact 
persons in cases of doubt. The framework is available to all employ-
ees on the intranet and to external third parties on the Internet. 
Employees can still contact Compliance – for example the Compli-
ance information point at Volkswagen AG.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Group > Compliance & Risk 
 Management > Compliance
Reference to the Code of Conduct and the obligation to comply with 
it are integral parts of the employment contracts. The Code of Con-
duct remained part of our employee appraisals in the reporting year 
and was thus taken into account when calculating their variable, 
performance-related remuneration. Members of the higher levels 
of management have been certified on the Code of Conduct since 
2019 and will be certified on it annually in the future.
In Group Compliance, numerous Group policies were transposed 
into the corresponding regulations at the brands and companies in 
the reporting year: dealing with gifts and the avoidance of con-
flicts of interest and corruption were regulated uniformly across 
the Group. In addition, the Volkswagen whistleblower system was 
strengthened as a central point of contact for serious breaches of 
rules. Group policies on the prevention of money laundering and

on mergers and acquisitions were also implemented. A new policy 
on governance and integrity, risk management, compliance and le-
gal (GRC+L) describes the organization, structure and functions for 
compliance, integrity, risk and legal.
IDENTIFYING AND REDUCING COMPLIANCE RISKS
We conducted a Group-wide compliance risk analysis (ICRA) in the 
reporting year. As part of the analysis, the Group companies were 
classified into different risk categories on the basis of a comprehen-
sive questionnaire. To reduce the potential risks, we have rolled out 
standardized compliance measures across the Group, the scale of 
which varies depending on the risk situation of the Group compa-
nies. This risk analysis will be repeated regularly.
MEASURING COMPLIANCE
To measure developments in compliance, we defined the “compli-
ance, culture of error management and behaving with integrity” 
strategic indicator for the major brands that manufacture passenger 
cars. This is based on an evaluation of the answers to three ques-
tions in the opinion survey relating to compliance with regulations 
and processes, dealing with risks and errors, and behaving with in-
tegrity. In the case of negative deviations, the affected departments 
develop and implement measures. In the reporting year, the key 
performance indicator further improved on the previous good 
figure.
HIGH COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BUSINESS 
PARTNERS
We also want to ensure that our business partners apply the same 
standard of integrity in business practices that applies to the 
Volkswagen Group. We therefore carried out integrity checks for 
business partners: so-called Business Partner Due Diligence (BP-
DD). This check is made as part of a risk-based, transparent and 
proper documentation process. The Group’s BPDD tool is an appli-
cation it uses to check on the basis of risk whether existing and po-
tential new direct business partners act with integrity and comply 
with all relevant laws, rules and regulations in their business. In the 
reporting year, we implemented our new standardized IT-based 
process worldwide. If a business partner does not meet our compli-
ance requirements, risk-reducing measures are taken.
In addition, we have revised the Code of Conduct for Business Part-
ners, in which the Compliance, Procurement and Sales divisions to-
gether draw up fundamental expectations of the business conduct 
and ethical behavior of their business partners for the first time, 
e.g. on the topics of human rights or the prevention of corruption.
WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM SHOWS BREACHES
The Volkswagen whistleblower system is the central point of con-
tact for reporting serious breaches of rules in the Volkswagen 
Group. The focus is on investigating such breaches of rules that 
could seriously damage the Group’s reputation or financial inter-
ests or that have significantly violated the Volkswagen Group’s eth-
ical core values. Examples of these include economic crimes, cor-
ruption offenses, tax offenses, environmental crimes, violations of 
human rights, breaches of antitrust and competition laws, money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism, breaches of produc-
tion-safety and licensing requirements and significant breaches of 
data protection regulations.
The aim of the whistleblower system is to protect Volkswagen and 
the workforce from harm using binding principles and a clearly 
governed process. Experience with reported breaches of rules helps 
to enhance compliance management and prevent similar incidents 
in future. The whistleblower system guarantees the highest possi-
ble protection of whistleblowers and those affected. An investiga-
tion is only initiated after very careful review of the information 
and where there are concrete indications of a breach of the rules. 
The persons implicated are presumed innocent for as long proof of 
any violation of the rules has not been established. They are treated 
fairly, their response is heard as soon as possible and their names 
are cleared if they have been wrongly accused. The entire investiga-
tion process is subject to strict confidentiality and secrecy. Whistle-
blowers are also protected and their statements are treated confi-
dentially. Their identity is not published if so desired and legally 
possible. Proven misconduct is sanctioned appropriately.
Information on misconduct by employees of the Volkswagen 
Group can be reported via a large number of reporting channels 
and the report can be made anonymously if desired. The whistle-
blower system is coordinated through the Central Investigation Of-
fice in Wolfsburg, which is also responsible for handling informa-
tion from whistleblowers concerning Volkswagen AG and its 
subsidiaries. AUDI AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG and TRATON SE 
each have separate investigation offices for themselves and their 
subsidiaries.
The options for making an anonymous report also include a spe-
cially protected online reporting channel, which can be used to 
communicate using aliases, and an international 24-hour telephone 
hotline that takes calls in a total of 17 languages. In addition, two 
external attorneys (ombudsmen) have been appointed to take in-
formation from whistleblowers.
In 2019, 3,174 pieces of whistleblower information were registered 
across the Group (excluding China) at the four investigation offices 
(2018: 1,560). This shows that employees feel at home with the 
whistleblower system and the underlying procedure. Moreover, 
this is proof that employees are motivated to make an active con-
tribution to preventing misconduct – there is a speak-up culture.
28
TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION FORMATS
The training and communication activities on the topic of compli-
ance were further expanded in the reporting year. The basis for un-
derstanding compliance in the Group is the training on the Code of 
Conduct, which is obligatory for all employee groups. Both face-to-
face and online training is provided. The training is regularly re-
peated with new and expanded content and is documented in em-
ployees’ training histories. In the reporting year, the Group also 
introduced mandatory anti-corruption training, which is also being 
rolled out across the Group. For the first time, raising awareness 
and training on this topic is aimed not only at internal target groups, 
but also implemented for business partners from sales and pro-
curement on the basis of risk.
In line with the risk-based approach, compliance training sessions 
for specific target groups will also continue to be carried out – in 
some cases compulsorily – including on the prevention of money 
laundering. Moreover, compliance content is communicated in 
various dialog formats or in talks and events as part of the staff de-
velopment programs. Various communication activities, campaigns 
and dialog formats, e.g. on the topic of anti-corruption or the whis-
tleblower system, also extensively informed our employees and 
raised their awareness on compliance topics in 2019. Group Com-
pliance is increasingly focusing on target-group-specific communi-
cation measures together with the departments.

REPORTING CHANNELS OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM
MONITORSHIP IN THE TESTING PERIOD
In October 2019, the US Department of Justice and the Independent 
Compliance Monitor Larry D. Thompson approved a request from 
Volkswagen to extend the testing period in the Monitorship. This 
means we have an additional 90 days to prove that we have met our 
commitments under the terms of Volkswagen’s 2017 settlement 
with the US government. This time is being used to fully test and, 
where necessary, remediate the measures that the Group and its 
brands have put in place, including recommendations from the 
Monitor, in order for Thompson to certify the Group’s ethics and 
compliance programs. Mr. Thompson's report will be submitted to 
the US Department of Justice in July 2020. His Monitorship, which 
was set at three years on his appointment in June 2017, will contin-
ue until September 2020.
As Volkswagen undertakes the biggest transformation in our history, 
we are working hard to embed a culture of integrity in everything 
we do and are making good progress. We intend to make sure that 
this change is lasting and continues long after the Monitorship 
ends. In a global company as large and complex as Volkswagen, we 
need to have enough time to be careful and rigorous in our upcom-
ing testing.
As Independent Compliance Monitor, Thompson is tasked with en-
suring that Volkswagen’s compliance and ethics programs are ap-
propriately designed and implemented to prevent and detect viola-
tions of US law of the kind that gave rise to the diesel crisis. He also 
oversees Volkswagen’s obligations under the terms of its 2017 set-
tlement of civil claims by the US federal government and the state 
of California as the Independent Compliance Auditor.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
For our Group, sustainability means simultaneously striving for 
economic, social and environmental goals in a way that gives them 
equal priority. As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, 
we want to use our creative power in line with our sustainability 
model for the benefit of people and the environment – in the full 
knowledge that conflicting objectives exist in practice, which means 
this is not always easy. We have therefore developed a sustainable 
style of company management and put in place the necessary 
management structures.
Our TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy enshrines the objective of 
shaping mobility to be sustainable for us and for generations to 
come. At the same time, we want to be an excellent employer and a 
role model for the environment, safety and integrity. We thus put 
sustainability at the center of running our business and in so doing 
are sending a signal that we are using the diesel crisis as an oppor-
tunity to make a new start.
A particular challenge when implementing our strategic goals on 
all levels of the value chain is the complexity of our Company, with 
its 12 brands, more than 670,000 employees and 124 production 
sites. We are taking our Group through the greatest transformation 
process in its history. This is particularly shaped by the transition 
to electric mobility, digitalization and new mobility services, which 
has affected our entire industry. We want to survive these challeng-
es and become the leading company for individual mobility in the 
electrical and connected age. Furthermore, we are anchoring digi-
talization in all the divisions.
Climate protection is currently the greatest global challenge. We 
want to give our response to this and have decided on an ambitious 
decarbonization program, which aims to make us a carbon-neutral 
company in 2050. This commitment to the Paris Agreement means 
we are taking on a pioneering role. We are also guided by the require-
ments of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) and are providing concrete information about how we handle 
risks and opportunities that arise from the consequences of climate 
change for our Group.
With digitalization too, we want to become a business that shapes 
the change and are working at full speed to advance its develop-
ment: not just in our vehicles and mobility services, but also in 
manufacturing and in management. This requires more of us than 
just developing new technologies and making them usable. The 
digital transformation must be supported by a forward-looking HR 
strategy that involves our employees, trains them and gives them 
job security.
ESSENTIALS AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Our actions are determined by the Volkswagen Group Essentials, 
which set out the values and foundations for our shared corporate 
culture. The Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct helps managers 
and employees deal with legal and ethical challenges in their day-
to-day work. We also gear our activities toward many internal 
guidelines on sustainability. They include the Social Charter, the 
Charter on Labor Relations, the Charter on Vocational Education as 
well as the Charter on Temporary Work.
Our objective with these fundamental principles is to achieve that 
the Volkswagen Group acts in compliance with international agree-
ments and frameworks, such as the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals, the declarations of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), the guidelines and agreements of the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the agreements 
of the United Nations on fundamental rights and freedoms.
In 2019, we developed “goTOzero”, the new Group environmental 
mission statement, which enshrines our goal of conducting busi-
ness in as environmentally friendly a manner as possible and to be-
come carbon-neutral by 2050. The four areas of activity – climate 
change, resources, air quality and environmental compliance – are 
part of the mission statement. As a global company, we are aware 
that the importance of some of the action areas identified as mate-
rial may differ significantly depending on the region.
 
 The Environment > Climate Protection
STRUCTURE AND TASKS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY ORGANIZATION
The organizational structures and organization as part of Group-
wide sustainability management were defined in more precise de-
tail in the reporting year. The resultant stipulations, structures and 
processes will subsequently be codified in a separate Group policy. 
The core elements of realignment include the establishment of the 
Chairman of the Group Board of Management’s cross-functional 
overall responsibility for sustainability, the responsibility of the 
members of the Board of Management responsible for different ar-
eas for specific management systems related to sustainability and 
the development of the Group Steering Committee for Sustainabili-
ty into a top committee of the Group. The members of this steering 
committee include executives from central Board of Management 
business areas and representatives of the brands and the Group 
Works Council. The Group Steering Committee for Sustainability 
defines concrete strategic targets and programs, sets out measures 
for uniform cross-business-area, cross-brand and cross-regional de-
velopment of sustainability management and makes decisions on 
sustainability-related basic issues and positions in the Volkswagen 
Group. It also handles the further development of Group-wide sus-
tainability management.
 The Group Steering Committee’s office is located in the Group’s 
sustainability function (Group Sustainability). Group Sustainabili-
ty has been restructured in the past months and integrated in the 
Office of the Corporate Secretary and Group Strategy. One particu-
lar objective of this reorganization is to ensure a close link between 
sustainability, the strategic company goals and the core business. 
Group Sustainability coordinates all sustainability-related activi-
ties within the Group. Working together with Board of Manage-
ment business areas, brands and regions, it defines and is responsi-
ble for so-called core processes of sustainability and sustainability

REVISING THE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
GRI 102-46, 102-49
We use the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) stand-
ards for our sustainability reporting. Since the 2017 reporting year, 
we have also used this framework with regard to the requirements 
of the CSR-RUG (German CSR Directive Implementation Act) regard-
ing the disclosure of nonfinancial information in accordance with 
HGB sections 315c in conjunction with sections 289c to 289e.
The new TOGETHER 2025+ corporate strategy with its four target di-
mensions and its vision of “shaping mobility – for generations to 
come”, for shaping mobility to be sustainable for current and fu-
ture generations, stand for a detailed analysis of which topics are 
material for the Volkswagen Group in 2019. We obtain material in-
formation for understanding the Volkswagen Group’s impact on 
society and the environment via our stakeholder management.
 
 Introduction > Group Profile
As the starting point for our materiality analysis, we are guided by 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the Unit-
ed Nations, which describe the social challenges facing companies. 
Based on the results, we defined 16 key action areas pursuant to 
HGB section 315c in conjunction with sections 289c to 289e, which 
are explained in detail in this report. In order to identify key topics, 
we took into account external studies, sector and media analyses, 
ratings, stakeholder surveys, internal and external guidelines and 
codes, the TOGETHER 2025+ strategy, benchmarks and the individ-
ual departmental strategies.
These Volkswagen Group action areas were assessed as regards 
their importance for the strategy and their stakeholder relevance. 
We analyzed stakeholders’ demands, expectations and attitudes in 
relation to the action areas as part of a reputation survey in which 
more than 600 national and international individuals from numer-
ous stakeholder groups participated. This procedure complements 
the activity of the established Stakeholder Panel and the Group 
companies’ stakeholder surveys. During this process, Volkswagen 
identified a total of 16 key topics.
programs (e.g. the decarbonization program). The core processes of 
sustainability encompass the sustainability strategy, the materiali-
ty analysis, stakeholder management, ratings and rankings, sus-
tainability policies and sustainability reporting (including the non-
financial report). 
In addition to the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability, 
regular discussions within the Group-wide sustainability network 
take place through various formats, such as the annual Group Sus-
tainability Summit. We have institutionalized our stakeholder 
management work through external committees. At the Group lev-
el, these are the Sustainability Council and the Stakeholder Panel.
31
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y
In the overall view of all 16 action areas, we take all economic, envi-
ronmental and social aspects of our corporate responsibility equal-
ly seriously. As a global company, we are aware that the importance 
of some of the action areas identified as material may differ signifi-
cantly depending on the region. We do not currently prioritize be-
tween the action areas, but in the future we will define clear focus-
es via our sustainability program. We have already set an initial 
focus with the Group decarbonization program.
As the details of the new Group strategy have not yet been final-
ized, we are still in the process of specifying the content of the key 
action areas and defining corresponding values, targets and indica-
tors. In 2020, we plan to continue the revision of our materiality 
analysis started in 2019, to implement the materiality analysis 
even more deeply within the company and to expand it to include 
an extensive IT-based data analysis.
STRATEGIC STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT

Our stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who 
have a material influence on or are materially influenced by the 
way in which the Group reaches its corporate decisions and the im-
plications of those decisions. We have identified ten stakeholder 
groups of equal value in our environment. Our customers and our 
employees represent the innermost ring of the external stakehold-
er network. Around this core, we have identified eight further 
groups. The Group’s supervisory and advisory bodies, such as the 
Supervisory Board or Works Council, the Sustainability Council 
and the monitor appointed by the US Department of Justice act as a 
particular interface between internal and external stakeholders. 
For us, stakeholder management means interacting with key stake-
holder groups systematically, continuously and in line with our

WITH HGB SECTIONS 289C (3) AND 315C (2) AND GRI STANDARDS
GRI 102-47
When further developing our materiality analysis in the 2019 report-
ing year, we focused on updating and strengthening the environ-
mental action areas and, in line with the “goTOzero” Group mission 
statement, defined the four action areas climate change, resources, 
air quality and environmental compliance. Digitalization and 
mobility concepts (previously product and road safety) are new key 
topics. Based on our organizational structure, integrity, compliance 
and governance have been combined into a single action area. We 
see risk management as a cross-divisional early warning system 
and it is therefore no longer reported as a separate action area.

TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy. Stakeholder management aims 
to systematically record expectations and use feedback from our 
stakeholders to critically reflect on strategic planning processes. 
From now on, it will be an integral component of the new Group 
policies on environmental and sustainability management.
The reputation KPI, as a nonfinancial performance indicator of the 
Group, also makes a decisive contribution to anchoring stakeholder 
management in the strategy. The strategic KPI is part of the “Best 
Governance” module of the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy and 
checks the extent to which our stakeholders see Volkswagen as a 
trustworthy group of companies. The indicator is based on the re-
sponses by external stakeholders to the question in the annual 
Group reputation survey about the degree to which they trust the 
Volkswagen Group. The survey data is based on personal telephone 
interviews that are conducted annually in the summer period with 
selected representatives from the fields of politics and associations, 
scientific bodies, NGOs, investors, analysts and business partners 
in the three key markets (Germany, the USA, China). The indicator 
shows the proportion of survey participants, as a figure of between 
0% and 100%, who state that they trust the Volkswagen Group. In 
2019, the Group achieved a figure of 34% of stakeholders compared 
to 26% in 2018. In the USA, the proportion was 55% (2018: 54%) and 
in China 93% (2018: 84%). Once a year, we produce a summary of 
our stakeholder feedback and the reaction of the Group in this re-
gard as part of our nonfinancial reporting. In the 2019 reporting 
year, our stakeholders submitted recommendations to the Group 
across all committees and formats. These suggestions and expecta-
tions provide important stimuli for further developing the Group 
strategy and sustainability management. A summary is available 
on the Group’s corporate website.

Given the size and complexity of the Group, we follow a multi-level 
approach. Our brands and regions have their own stakeholder 
33
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y
activities. The Group’s task is to bring together all of these activities 
in an integrated stakeholder activity framework. This includes:
• Stakeholder activities on a Group level with specific committees, 
special formats and a focus on stakeholders relevant across the 
Group
• Advising and coordinating the brands and regions and their ac-
tivities through Group sustainability management.
• Harmonizing activities, e.g. with the help of our sustainability 
model, stakeholder guidelines and regular internal meetings to 
share best practices
• Documenting activities, e.g. with the help of the sustainability 
report and the “Shift” magazine, our Group website, press releas-
es, newsletters and social media
• Carrying out regular stakeholder analyses and stakeholder 
surveys
SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY
To support its strategic sustainability issues, the Volkswagen Group 
appointed a Sustainability Council in September 2016. This is made 
up of internationally renowned experts from the academic world, 
politics and society. The Council establishes its own working methods 
and areas of focus independently, has extensive rights for the purpos-
es of exchanging information, consultation and initiating action, and 
consults regularly with the Board of Management, top management 
and the employee representatives. The project, which began in 2018, 
achieved its first results in 2019: the Open Source Lab on Sustainable 
Mobility, for example, organized dialog events about using open data 
in mobility and prepared handouts, the international program for 
financing forecast-based civil protection has implemented initial 
mechanisms, the research project on transport policy instruments 
for achieving international climate targets has published initial short 
studies, the visiting professors at Open Labs have begun their work 
and the project for the strategic focus of sustainability at Volkswagen 
has reached its first milestones. In addition, the Council decided on 
three new initiatives: a research project on distribution effects and 
the acceptance of climate-friendly fiscal policies, a survey on the ef-
fects of digitalization and e-mobility on employment and a com-
mitment to a sustainable cobalt supply chain. Furthermore, the 
Sustainability Council formulated further recommendations for how 
technological, political and cultural change should be organized to 
win back trust and lay the foundations for future success.
OPEN DISCUSSIONS IN THE STAKEHOLDER PANEL
The Volkswagen Group has established a Stakeholder Panel, which 
has overseen the Group sustainability activities for over 20 years. 
The aim is to critically question and continuously improve sustain-
ability management, Group initiatives and reporting processes. 
The members of the panel receive invitations to dialog events and 
surveys at regular intervals and are our reference points in stake-
holder analyses. In the 2019 reporting year, we increased the size 
of the panel in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland) from 150 to more than 300 participants. For 2020, 
we plan to establish an international panel of a comparable size as 
the basis for international stakeholder dialog activities.
DIALOG AND INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES
GRI 102-43
In June 2019, we launched the Volkswagen Group Stakeholder Dia-
log Series in Wolfsburg as a Group-wide dialog series in the confer-
ence format. The aims were the open-ended recording of stakehold-
er ideas and the transparent provision of information on current 
sustainability topics, such as electrification, decarbonization, cul-
tural change and sustainable supply chains. By cooperating with 
initiatives, we continuously expand our collaboration with exter-
nal partners. For example, the Volkswagen Group became the first 
automotive manufacturer to be an official member of the Global 
Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI) in September 2019. This 
highlights our commitment to protecting human rights at all lev-
els of the value chain.
A detailed overview of our activity formats can be found on our 
website:

REPRESENTATION OF INTERESTS TOWARDS POLITICS AND SOCIETY
GRI 415-1
The Volkswagen Group and its brands work in a complex and high-
ly regulated environment. When making business decisions, nu-
merous conditions must therefore be taken into account and the 
consequences of these decisions for our stakeholders must be as-
sessed and factored in. We consider it our responsibility to actively 
participate in shaping the framework for our economic activity in 
dialog with these groups.
On a Group level, the representation of the Group’s political inter-
ests towards governments, parliaments, authorities, associations, 
institutions and society is coordinated worldwide and a coordinat-
ed approach and action and consistent communication of the 
brands and companies is ensured. To this end, in the 2019 report-
ing year, the structures were refined by a Group-wide policy and 
additionally a “Public Affairs” steering committee was set up. The 
committee regularly reports to the Group Board of Management.
Principles such as integrity, openness and verifiability and guide-
lines for contact with politicians as well as rules for transparency are 
set out in the Group-wide policy. For instance, Volkswagen AG’s entry 
in the European Union’s transparency register and the disclosure of 
our positions represented to politicians in the reporting year are 
based on these principles. For example, we advocate a sustainable 
and politically united Europe that is based on strong EU institutions 
and on the principles of the internal market and freedom of move-
ment for workers. We support free and fair international trade rela-
tions on the basis of global agreements that protect human rights 
and promote prosperity, employment and growth. In some cases, we 
have attracted public criticism in individual countries due to our 
34
business activities. More generally, these debates are also about the 
question of whether and how international corporations can be ac-
tive in political systems whose values are not lived by the Group and 
do not correspond to represented values. We believe politicians – not 
companies – set the framework for corporate action. Fundamentally, 
we orient our business decisions on local laws within the framework 
of international requirements, such as the UN Norms on Corporate 
Human Rights Responsibilities, and on our own ethical standards. 
Wherever we operate, we live and represent our values. We derive the 
commitment to oppose any strengthening of extremism in politics 
and society from our historical responsibility.
Rules for the representation of the Group’s political interests in as-
sociations have also been developed as part of the Group-wide poli-
cy. Firstly, all areas in the Group that carry out the tasks of repre-
senting political interests inform the Public Affairs Division of 
their activities. Secondly, policymakers within the associations are 
committed to the same principles and guidelines. They undertake 
to contribute the Group’s positions for dialog with politicians to the 
discussions within these organizations within the framework of 
what is permitted under competition and antitrust law without 
change. Where the positions for dialog with politicians that are de-
cided in the group of members differ substantially from the con-
tributed positions of the Group, this is recorded as dissent.
The Group does not make political donations as a matter of princi-
ple. Where other forms of financial support are permitted and de-
sirable, we set rules for granting and disclosing this support, for ex-
ample for parties in the democratic spectrum in Germany in the 
context of sponsoring. Figures for the support of party events and 
for the advertising budget for party-affiliated publications are dis-
closed annually.

STRENGTHENING OF INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE
We have learned from the errors of the past, particularly from 
those of the diesel crisis. We continue to strengthen integrity and 
compliance in the Volkswagen Group, because our goal is to be a 
role model in this area. This is not just shown by the development 
of the integrity index and our commitment to the implementation 
of our Group-wide Together4Integrity (T4I) program. We have also 
created new and extended Group policies in the areas of the pre-
vention of corruption, the whistleblower system, money launder-
ing and business partner due diligence. Furthermore, we have es-
tablished a compliance management system for human rights, 
thus creating the conditions for completely integrating the busi-
ness and human rights focus area into the Volkswagen Group’s 
compliance management system. We have also underlined the sig-
nificance of this action area with the Board of Management’s ap-
pointment of a coordinator for the topic of human rights in 2019. 
In the field of environmental management, we have put compli-
ance on a new footing, thus reflecting our knowledge that serious 
breaches of rules are also associated with significant damage for 
our Group and society in this area. We will tackle corresponding 
risks at an early stage.
We are consistently extending this principle of comprehensive risk 
prevention to all issues of corporate responsibility and have specifi-
cally further developed the Volkswagen Group’s risk management 
system to this end. Along with risks that arise for the Group as a re-
sult of changed, external general conditions, we also take account 
of the impact on and associated risk for people, the environment 
and society that may originate from the Group.
MEASURABILITY OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE
We will make our sustainability performance even easier to meas-
ure in the future and have developed new strategic figures and ex-
tended existing indicators for this. There are various key perfor-
mance indicators for sustainability:
• The decarbonization index measures the Group-wide reduction 
of CO2 emissions per vehicle over the entire life cycle of the prod-
uct portfolio of major brands that manufacture passenger cars 
and of light commercial vehicles in the Europe (EU-28, Norway 
and Iceland), China¹ and US regions.
• The Opinion Survey provides information on employee satisfac-
tion and the internal assessment of employer attractiveness.
• The diversity index assesses achievement of the target of increas-
ing the proportion of women and the level of internationaliza-
tion in management.
• The integrity index shows the progress in achieving targets in 
the field of integrity and compliance and the corresponding need 
for action. In addition, it makes changes in managers’ attitudes 
and actions visible to employees. We started the integrity index 
in 2019 as a pilot project for Volkswagen Passenger Cars Germa-
ny and the German sites of AUDI AG.
• The reputation KPI is calculated using international surveys on 
stakeholders’ trust in the Volkswagen Group.
These and other strategic KPIs are linked with concrete programs 
and roadmaps in our action areas that are being gradually rolled 
out in all brands and companies. Further details can be found in 
the relevant chapters of this report.
We are also increasing measurability in the sustainable organiza-
tion of our supply chain. As of this this year, we evaluate our suppli-
ers’ sustainability performance in the fields of ecology, society, in-
tegrity and human rights with a new sustainability rating and 
show them opportunities for improvement. We are now also mak-
ing the measurement a decisive criteria for awarding contracts and 
for maintaining business relations. This is particularly a response 
to the challenge that the transition to electric mobility means re-
source consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the extrac-
tion of raw materials and production may rise, but human rights 
risks may also increase in value creation, e.g. in the field of conflict 
minerals.
¹ Fleet emissions have been calculated on the basis of the rules applicable in China, including taking credits for BEVs and PHEVs into account.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a good corporate citizen, we would like to be a constant econom-
ic driver, contributing to local structural development and equal 
opportunities. We have always believed in the importance of recog-
nizing our social responsibilities towards our stakeholders. The 
main focus of our corporate social engagement activities is on sup-
porting local development, educational and community projects 
at many of our sites around the world. In 2019, the brands and com-
panies supported more than 520 projects and initiatives on a global 
scale – information on the individual topics and projects can be 
found on our website:
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting > CC-Pro-
jects Worldwide
We select specific projects and develop them on our own or in part-
nership with local partner organizations and NGOs. We choose and 
carry out projects in accordance with our Group-wide guidelines:
• The projects are in accordance with the Group Essentials and ad-
dress a specific issue of local relevance or a global challenge.
• They are an expression of diversity within the Group and the so-
cial environment in which the projects are carried out.
• They are the result of close stakeholder dialog with the local play-
ers involved in implementation.
• Project management is the responsibility of the local units work-
ing on the project.
TRANSPARENCY THROUGH IMPACT ANALYSES
In the interests of our ability to manage the Group, we want to take 
decisions on complex issues on a broader knowledge basis and with 
the aid of outstanding analysis ability. This also strengthens the 
Group’s reputation, the legitimacy of the business model and the 
dialog with our stakeholders, to whom we want to communicate 
our approach transparently and verifiably. 
For example, the Volkswagen Group has set itself the objective of 
measuring the impact of its actions more quantitatively in the fu-
ture and, if possible and reasonable, to monetize this. It is about 
positive and negative impacts that the Group has in all sustainabili-
ty dimensions with its business, supply chains and products and 
services. To this end, we conducted a pilot project at the Kassel site 
in 2019. We chose the site in view of the plant’s transformation in 
the direction of e-mobility, its ability to innovate and its role as a 
large employer anchored in the region.
We want to not just expand this process as a management approach 
and as an analysis and reporting tool, but particularly to evaluate 
our contribution to meeting the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable De-
velopment Goals with it.
With this approach, the Volkswagen Group and Porsche are sup-
porting the tasks of the value balancing alliance initiative, which 
campaigns for standardization of impact assessment. 
We also strive to be able to understand the impact of new mobility 
concepts and vehicle technologies even better and assess these reli-
ably. We are thus carrying out impact assessments based on real data, 
models and simulations in many areas. These include, for example, 
concepts of shared mobility, congestion avoidance at traffic lights 
or the improvement of air quality in urban areas.
In any event, our sustainability strategy focuses on improvements of 
the traffic situation in urban areas and global cities. This is where 
we believe the future of mobility will be decided. The majority of 
the world’s population already lives in cities where traffic problems 
with congestion, accidents and poor air quality demand concrete 
solutions. We therefore aim for a close partnership with cities across 
the world and want to shape urban mobility to be sustainable to-
gether with them.
SUSTAINABILITY RATINGS
Analysts and investors are referring increasingly to company sus-
tainability profiles when making their recommendations and deci-
sions. They draw primarily on sustainability ratings to evaluate a 
company’s environmental, social and governance performance. At 
the same time, sustainability ratings are instrumental in determin-
ing whether we are meeting our goal of being one of the world’s 
leading providers of sustainable mobility. Furthermore, they pro-
vide the basis for implementing internal measures.
After the diesel issue became public knowledge, the Volkswagen 
Group was downgraded significantly in the MSCI, RobecoSAM, Sus-
tainalytics, oekomISS, Vigeo Eiris, EcoVadis and RepRisk sustaina-
bility indices and consequently removed from sustainability indices 
such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. 
In fiscal year 2019, Volkswagen continued to have a score of A– in 
the CDP and had an A rating in the Water Disclosure Project (WDP).

During the reporting year, we were involved in numerous projects 
to sustainably improve social structures. We give donations in cash 
and in kind to support activities and projects primarily devoted to 
education, culture, sports and social causes. Donations may only be 
given to recognized nonprofit organizations or ones specifically 
endorsed to receive donations. In the reporting period, Volkswagen 
AG made donations amounting to €33.6 million. 
In the long-term cooperation between the Volkswagen AG and the 
German Red Cross, the focus in the reporting period was on the 
Forecast-Based Financing program. The subject of the program is 
the provision of financial resources for humanitarian aid on the 
basis of detailed forecasts and risk analyses. The aim is to predict 
disasters, to minimize their effects as far as possible and thus pre-
vent human suffering. Another part of the partnership is the “Fu-
ture of public health protection and the emergency services in 
Germany”.
The topic of corporate volunteering is particularly important to us 
in the context of employees’ broad involvement in running the 
business. An important component of volunteering in Volkswagen 
AG is the Volkswagen pro Ehrenamt program. The aim is to raise 
more awareness of voluntary activities and to support and encour-
age them. This is why Volkswagen sees Pro Ehrenamt as a hub be-
tween people who want to get involved and those who have volun-
tary work to offer. The program is aimed at all Volkswagen 
employees and their partners at our sites and at former employees 
in early retirement or retirement.
The Volkswagen workforce has taken on social responsibility for 
people in need for decades: Volkswagen AG’s employees donated 
more than €760,000 in 2019. Employees and the Group support dis-
advantaged people at the Volkswagen AG locations through these 
workforce donations. Support is given to specific projects, which, 
for example, improve the situation of people whose quality of life 
has been affected by illness, disability, or other circumstances. 
Likewise, the Group’s employees, led by the Group Works Council, 
have supported the international children’s relief organization 
terre des hommes for 20 years. In 2019, the amount donated was 
more than €1.2 million. At the Volkswagen Group’s production lo-
cations in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand 
and Germany, a wide variety of projects for disadvantaged boys 
and girls are funded from the donations. They are given protection, 
support, the opportunity for education and career prospects. Em-
ployees do not just get involved as part of special campaigns, such 
as the Audi workforce fundraising for earthquake victims in Mexi-
co. For years, many employees have also been donating the cents 
shown after the decimal point in their pay slips.
INTEGRATION SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES
The Volkswagen Group’s refugee aid program also created a large 
number of site-specific options for refugees in cooperation with the 
people responsible for sustainability of the Group brands in 2019. 
There were three areas of focus here: meeting, education and pro-
fessional integration.
Regular opportunities to meet other people, such as “Kitchen Sto-
ries” or “Kicking About and Cooking” have encouraged communi-
cation between our employees and refugees and dismantled reser-
vations. In the field of education, our focus was on acquiring language 
skills, developing expertise and obtaining primary qualifications, 
because these skills form the basis for career prospects for refugees 
in Germany. We offered language courses lasting a number of 
months, supported integration and employability courses and, to-
gether with our cooperation partner for student support, Kiron, 
brought together refugee students and Volkswagen employees in 
intercultural workshops.
We have implemented career guidance and skills assessment meas-
ures at various Group sites. Our entry-level vocational qualification 
options, which combine theoretical and practical preparation for a 
career and an intensive language course and thus prepare refugees 
for an apprenticeship in Germany, were just as successful. Appren-
ticeship options for refugees rounded off the offering.
In addition to the Group-wide involvement of the Audi, Porsche, 
MAN, Volkswagen Financial Services, Volkswagen Commercial Ve-
hicles and Volkswagen Passenger Cars brands, many employees of 
the Volkswagen Group do voluntary work for refugees. Supporting 
them in this is also the Volkswagen Group’s refugee aid program’s 
task. From 2015 until the end of 2019, we reached more than 5,000 
refugees through our projects.
SUPPORTING SOCIAL BUSINESS
The Volkswagen Group supported the Global Social Business Sum-
mit again in November 2019. In Berlin, 550 representatives from 
business, the academic world, politics and society discussed busi-
ness models that pursue social and environmental objectives and 
are at the same time economic. The participants came from 54 
countries.
The Volkswagen Group supported the annual conference with Nobel 
Peace Prize winner Prof. Muhammad Yunus for the fourth time. At 
the event, international social business players presented their ideas 
for a more sustainable and more social world in various workshops 
and worked on their own possible social business projects with the 
Volkswagen Group.
CONNECTING DIGITALIZATION AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
The Volkswagen Group also increasingly uses the potential of digi-
talization in its social engagement. One example is the xStarters 
program, which focuses on the digital education of young people. 
In creative workshops with design thinking elements, young peo-
ple between the ages of 14 and 19 learn digital and non-digital skills 
for the future around finding ideas, prototyping or robotics in and 
outside of schools. Slightly more than 100 workshops have been 
held since 2018 and approximately 2,400 school students have

R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y
SUPPLY CHAIN
GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
We purchase products and services around the world to manufac-
ture our products. At 40 locations in 24 countries, our procurement 
network ensures that our production facilities are supplied with 
materials of the requisite quality, in the required quantities, at 
competitive prices. Due to the complexity of its products, the 
Volkswagen Group’s supply chain is highly complex, globally dis-
tributed and subject to constant change. In a business with interna-
tional production facilities and sales activities in more than 150 
countries, compliance with due diligence obligations is an enor-
mous challenge and a great responsibility.
The greater penetration of e-mobility in our fleet also means that 
emissions will shift from the usage phase to the supply chain in the 
future. If nothing else, the high demand for energy for the produc-
tion of components for electric mobility plays an important role 
here. This is why the reduction of CO2 emissions in the supply 
chain represents a strategic topic of focus for us. At the same time, 
e-mobility means an increase in the consumption of difficult-to- 
obtain raw materials and minerals. The Volkswagen Group and its 
suppliers are confronted with increasing expectations and regula-
tory requirements resulting, for example, from the National Action 
Plans to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Hu-
man Rights.
MANAGEMENT APPROACH WITH THREE DIMENSIONS OF ACTION1
We want to live up to our responsibility in our business relation-
ships on a global level and act proactively beyond fulfilling legal re-
quirements. In procurement, we follow a three-pronged approach 
to establishing sustainable supply chains with the focuses of decar-
bonization, human rights, responsible procurement of raw materi-
als and combating corruption. This step requires transparency 
about the supply relationships that go beyond the first tier (tier 1).

been reached. Volkswagen Group employees are also involved in 
the xStarters program, working as volunteers to contribute their 
knowhow and support the young people.
The connection of sustainability and digitalization can also be 
found in procurement in the Volkswagen Group. Transparency in 
the supply chain is a cross-sectoral hot topic that particularly af-
fects the automotive industry. For example, the conversion to 
e-mobility poses a challenge for the Volkswagen Group both in 
terms of the technology and infrastructure: in order to be able to 
ensure sustainable mobility, responsible procurement of raw mate-
rials has the highest priority, particularly in the case of cobalt, lithi-
um, nickel, lead and rare earths.
That is why the Volkswagen Group, Adidas, Zalando and Deutsche 
Bahn work together in a collective impact initiative and have to-
gether put on the Supply Chain Transparency Hackathon Series 
since 2018. The aim of this format from the corporate citizenship 
business area is to make expert knowledge from the companies in-
volved available to start-ups via corporate volunteering. The partic-
ipants from various disciplines each work together with the start-
ups in cross-company teams for one day in order to develop 
innovative, digital solutions for practical applications. In this way, 
for example, it should be possible to track respect for human rights 
and compliance with environmental standards along multi-tiered 
supply chains more easily. The hackathon series was continued in 
2019 with three events and 300 participants.

• Prevent: Sustainability requirements are enshrined in contracts 
and specifications, particularly the Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners. Suppliers are trained and their awareness is raised.
• Detect: The sustainability risks in the supply chain are systemat-
ically detected and prioritized. Sustainability is anchored in the 
material contract award decisions across the Group and a rating 
of potential suppliers’ sustainability performance (“S rating”) is 
used. The basis for this is self-assessment and risk-based on-site 
audits.
• React: Various measures are available to react to the risks and 
impacts identified. These include a standardized ad-hoc process 
to review breaches by individual suppliers and action plans from 
audits. The key objective is to rectify and prevent breaches and to 
actively and effectively improve suppliers’ sustainability 
performance.
In order to identify current developments and long-term challeng-
es in the individual countries, we encourage dialog between our 
brands and regions through the Sustainability Procurement Net-
work, in which more than 50 experts from five continents work 
together.
CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLIERS (PREVENT)
The core element of our supplier management is the “Volkswagen 
requirements for sustainability in relations with business part-
ners” – the Code of Conduct for Business Partners. This was thor-
oughly updated in 2019. It embeds our expectations of our busi-
ness partners’ conduct with respect to key environmental, social 
and compliance standards in our contractual agreements. The re-
quirements are based, among other things, on the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Busi-
ness and Human Rights and the relevant International Labour Or-
ganization (ILO) conventions. The Code of Conduct is, however, not 
just based on international standards, but also objectives, rules and 
policies of the Volkswagen Group.
In the area of the environment, for example, there is a requirement 
that business partners with production facilities where more than 
100 employees work must have a certified environmental manage-
ment system in accordance with ISO 14001 or EMAS. Suppliers 
must share information about total energy consumption and CO2 
emissions with the Volkswagen Group on request. In addition, we 
recommend that our suppliers put in place a certified occupational 
health and safety management system that complies with OHSAS 
18001, SA8000 and/or AA1000.
Before submitting a quotation, our suppliers must confirm that 
they acknowledge our sustainability requirements; this explicit ac-
knowledgment must be repeated after 12 months have elapsed if 
they wish to submit new quotations. We also call on our tier 1 sup-
pliers to pass our requirements set out in the Code of Conduct 
down along the supply chain.
SYSTEMATIC DETECTION OF SUSTAINABILITY RISKS (DETECT)
Our aim is to know and effectively address the material sustaina-
bility risks in our supply chain at all times. A sustainability rating 
(S rating) was introduced as a key measure in mid-2019 and has 
since been implemented across the Group. It is used to audit the 
sustainability performance of suppliers and show opportunities 
for continuous improvement. It assesses the environmental perfor-
mance of suppliers and their social sustainability and integrity.
The S rating is directly relevant to awarding contracts: if a supplier 
does not meet our requirements for compliance with sustainability 
standards, it is fundamentally not eligible for the award of con-
tracts. There is thus a direct incentive for suppliers to improve their 
sustainability performance.
The check for the S rating takes place via a multistage process. In an 
initial step, the risk exposure is identified based on a combination 
of country risk and the supplier’s corporate processes and policies. 
A specialist service provider is used for the identification of the 
country risk. The Group’s sustainability performance is analyzed 
by means of a standardized questionnaire for self-assessment. We 
developed the “SAQ” questionnaire in a joint project with other auto-
motive corporations involved in the DRIVE Sustainability Working 
Group organized by CSR Europe. The information and documents 
in the SAQ are rechecked and validated by a service provider: if a 
supplier states that it has appropriate processes and policies, it 
must prove this with documents.
A total of 12,646 suppliers submitted a questionnaire in 2019. In the 
reporting year, over 5,915 suppliers improved their sustainability per-
formance through taking appropriate steps. 65% of our 2,000 highest- 
revenue suppliers documented that they have a certified environ-
mental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 and/or 
EMAS.
Following an initial analysis of the supplier data, in-depth audits 
are carried out on site, based on risk. If the results of the audit re-
veal serious shortcomings in the implementation of our sustaina-
bility requirements, the supplier in question is generally given a 
negative rating. This means that the award of a contract is generally 
not possible. 1,331 on-site audits were carried out worldwide in 
2019. On average, three breaches of our sustainability require-
ments were identified. Clear differences can be seen depending on 
the region.

R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y
In order to avoid duplication and for broader coverage of the supply 
chain, we are currently working together with OEMs and suppliers 
in a working group of the German Association of the Automotive 
Industry (VDA) on a joint standard for on-site audits. The plan is 
that suppliers will only have to have themselves audited once from 
2020 onward. The results can then be shared with all the business 
partners involved via a central platform.
The Volkswagen Group has been preparing its business partners for 
the S rating with information and in events and workshops for al-
most a year. By directly connecting the sustainability performance 
to eligibility for the award of contracts, the Volkswagen Group is 
sending a clear signal to its suppliers to work towards sustainable 
penetration of the supply chain together with the Volkswagen 
Group – because the primary aim is not to exclude suppliers from 
the supply chain through the S rating, but rather to equip those 
who cannot yet produce a satisfactory performance to do so. This is 
the only way in which positive impacts on people and the environ-
ment can be achieved. With this in mind, every supplier has the op-
tion of undergoing a reassessment after taking improvement 
measures.
Business partners who we have identified as having an increased 
corruption risk due to their business and region are also subjected 
to an in-depth audit. All relevant business partners will then be 
continuously checked for any change in general conditions through 
a risk and news screening. So far, our database contains 416 Business 
Partner Due Diligence audits.
 
 Responsibility > Compliance
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ON SITE (REACT) 
A series of measures are available to react to risks identified in the 
supply chain and concrete breaches by suppliers, and thus to actively 
bring about improvements.
What we refer to as “ad-hoc cases”, i.e. suspected breaches of the 
sustainability requirements that occur suddenly, represent a sig-
nificant component of sustainable supply chain management. The 
process of ad-hoc case management was revised and systematized 
in 2019.
The breaches that lead to opening an ad-hoc case can, for example, 
be uncovered through information from third parties or employ-
ees in the supplier businesses. In such a case, the relevant ad-hoc 
expert team of the relevant brand or region coordinates a catalog 
of measures and is supported by the Group ad-hoc expert team.
If we determine that suppliers or sub-suppliers are failing to meet 
our sustainability requirements in such a case, we ask them to pro-
vide a written statement based on a standardized report (6D Re-
port). Based on six points, our business partners can describe the 
situation and any remedial measures. Repeated on-site checks car-
ried out by external service providers can help to determine 
whether the measures were carried out in a satisfactory manner.
DEALING WITH AD-HOC CASES
During the reporting period, Group Internal Audit agreed meas-
ures with suppliers in addition to 27 ad-hoc cases that were proc-
essed by Procurement. This concerned suppliers where behavior 
contravening the rules or contracts was identified as a result of in-
formation provided or audits carried out. The collaboration was 
ended or suppliers were blocked for new awards of contracts in the 
case of a total of 17 suppliers due to the activities of Procurement 
and Internal Audit.
Employees and external parties can also report potential breaches 
of rules on the part of our suppliers to the Volkswagen Group’s em-
ployee representatives or the trade union associations and use the 
Volkswagen Group’s whistleblower system. Potential breaches of 
rules can also be reported to sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com. 
This applies to possible breaches on the part of our tier 1 suppliers 
as well as sub-suppliers in the supply chain. External ombudsmen 
are available as a further point of contact.
PARTICULAR DUTY OF DUE DILIGENCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
As part of our sustainable supplier management measures, we 
pay particular attention to protecting those groups of people who, 
along our supply chain, are at particularly high risk of human 
rights abuses. In this context, we are guided by the implementation 
of processes of due diligence with regard to human rights, as re-
quired in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In 
line with the requirements of a risk-based approach, we concen-
trate our measures on the supply chains that are associated with 
particularly high risks for negative impacts according to our 
analyses.
These particularly include our raw materials supply chains. The 
way we organize the responsible sourcing of raw materials is driven 
by the requirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Re-
sponsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-
Risk Areas. This contains guidelines for management approaches, 
for risk identification and prevention, for checking smelters and for 
communication and reporting instruments.
With regard to the conflict minerals tin, tantalum, tungsten and 
gold, for example, we require our suppliers’ management systems 
to exclude the use of minerals from smelters not certified in accor-
dance with international standards. We check these by obtaining

reports about all smelters in our upstream supply chain through 
the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s internationally recognized 
Complex Mineral Reporting Template and evaluating the results. In 
the reporting year, 473 groups of companies supplied components 
that also contained tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold. We have clearly 
identified 327 smelters of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in their 
supply chains. If we identify noncertified smelters in our supply 
chain, we take steps to certify these smelters.
However, within the framework of our human rights due diligence 
obligations we also work in other raw material supply chains. To 
this end, we closely cooperate with our direct suppliers and in sus-
pected cases of noncompliance require our suppliers to disclose the 
sources of materials that may have some connection with human 
rights violations, such as child, forced or compulsory labor as well 
as any other forms of modern slavery or human trafficking. This also 
applies to labor conditions in the extraction of raw materials such 
as cobalt, mica, or natural rubber. Because these processes are very 
time consuming as a result of the complexity of supply chains with 
up to eight tiers, we proceed on the basis of risk. In order to work 
systematically and in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance 
for this, we are currently developing an enterprise risk manage-
ment system for the issue of raw materials.
Our current focus of action is battery materials, particularly cobalt. 
In close collaboration with our battery cell suppliers, we are pursu-
ing the objective of creating complete supply chain transparency 
from mining the raw materials to manufacturing the finished 
product. This is the only way in which we can effectively prevent 
negative impacts. One component of our strategy in this context is 
also working directly with the mine operators, because the risk of 
violations, particularly of human rights, is highest at the start of 
the supply chain and this can consequently be countered the most 
effectively.
BLOCKCHAIN FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY IN THE 
SUPPLY CHAIN
In order to increase transparency in the supply chain and to avoid 
risk in the procurement of raw materials, the Volkswagen Group is 
currently piloting the use of blockchain technology in global and 
complex supply chains.
For example, in 2019 the Volkswagen Group joined the Responsible 
Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN) for the responsible sourcing 
of strategic minerals using blockchain technology. The collabora-
tion will enable us to gain greater insight into the provenance of co-
balt used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Other miner-
als used in vehicle production can also be tracked in this way.
In April 2019, the Volkswagen Group also launched a pilot project 
for the global lead supply chain and closely cooperates with the 
tech company Minespider here. The project will involve suppliers 
and sub-suppliers that deliver more than two thirds of the Group’s 
total lead starter battery requirements. The collaboration is the 
outcome of a “Hackathon for Supply Chain Transparency” held in 
2018, in which Minespider came first. 
In order to exclude human rights violations in our own supply 
chain, we also plan to audit the sustainability performance of the 
mines in our supply chain in the medium term. No standard is cur-
rently available. At the start 2019, Volkswagen therefore joined the 
CERA (Certification of Raw Materials) project, which has committed 
itself to developing such a standard and will test this on selected 
raw materials.
INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
The work in the deeper tiers of the supply chain and beyond con-
tractual relations requires more far-reaching efforts from us. We 
will only achieve this through joint, industry-wide initiatives and 
partnership-based collaboration with suppliers. Therefore, our goal 
must be to work together with them on improving their sustaina-
bility performance.
In our work, we seek close cooperation with international organiza-
tions. As part of our supplier management, we use the Risk Readi-
ness Assessment (RRA) and standardized reporting templates of 
the Responsible Minerals Initiative. As a member of the World Eco-
nomic Forum’s Global Battery Alliance, we want to catalyze meas-
ures towards a socially responsible, environmentally sustainable 
and innovative battery value chain.
In order to ensure transparency of cash flows and to support the 
combating of corruption in extractive countries, we are involved in 
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is 
supported by governments, NGOs, investors and renowned 
companies.
Our involvement in the industry-led initiative DRIVE Sustainability 
under the umbrella of CSR Europe is also key for our activities. The 
development of the common questionnaire standard for auditing 
sustainability aspects of suppliers was a milestone in this respect, 
as was the training approach for suppliers pursued jointly with oth-
er OEMs via training events in selected countries.
DECARBONIZATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN
The Volkswagen Group pursues the objective of continuously 
avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life 
cycle of a vehicle. Greater importance is increasingly attached to 
the supply chain here, because the switch to electric mobility shifts 
emissions away from the usage phase towards production and the 
supply chain.
In order to encourage measures for reducing greenhouse gas 
among suppliers, we identify the greatest sources of emissions 
along the supply chain on the basis of our vehicles’ life cycle assess-
ment data. Building on a hotspot analysis, joint roadmaps were de-
veloped in numerous workshops with suppliers from relevant in-
dustries in the reporting year in order to coordinate and pursue

HUMAN RIGHTS
TAKING ACCOUNT OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DOING BUSINESS
It is particularly important for the Volkswagen Group to identify 
which risks for human rights violations may result from its activi-
ties as early as possible. We want to respect human rights and live 
up to our corporate responsibility in our business activities. We are 
fundamentally guided by international requirements and stan-
dards, to which we are committed. This applies both to processes 
within our Group and to collaboration with our business partners 
and suppliers – i.e. at all levels of the value chain and the supply 
chain. We are currently implementing this concept in the Group. 
We implement our management approach throughout the Group: 
controlled companies are included, for example within standard-
ized risk management processes. In the case of noncontrolled 
companies, an individual analysis is carried out within the risk 
management approach. Here we rely on collabroation with our cor-
porate partners.
objectives and measures for CO2 reduction. The biggest driver of 
emissions in the supply chain for electric mobility is the HV bat-
tery cell. We have therefore consistently made the use of renewable 
energies for the production of our HV battery cells a contractual 
requirement.
We extend the responsibility for environmental effects of our vehi-
cles to our suppliers throughout the value chain. We have been ac-
tively involved in the CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP) since 2015 
and also received a score of A– again for the reporting year there. 
This corresponds to leadership status. In 2019, we significantly ex-
panded the number of suppliers who we survey as part of the SCP 
regarding responsibility for our climate and water to more than 
280 suppliers. That is equivalent to more than 79% of our production- 
related procurement spending (excluding services, Volkswagen 
Brazil, Scania and our joint ventures in China). According to our 
suppliers’ self- assessments, they reduced their overall emissions by 
a total of 8.05 million t of CO2e compared to the previous year. The 
suppliers put the proportion of renewable electrical energy at 23%. 
Since 2016, the CDP has included science-based targets (SBTs) in the 
questionnaire: 34% of our answering suppliers have already set 
SBTs or have undertaken to set such targets. 
Of course, a supply chain free from greenhouse gas emissions is 
currently still a vision. It was therefore decided that all greenhouse 
gas emissions arising in the supply chain for the ID.3 will be offset 
through global climate protection projects in the future.
 
 Introduction > Decarbonization
SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES AND PARTNERS
Systematic training of our employees and suppliers is a central 
component of our strategy and essential for the improvement of 
sustainability in the supply chain. For all Procurement employees, 
this issue is an established part of the skills profile. In 2019, more 
than 3,300 procurement staff worldwide were given training in 
this area. Our training measures are also geared to specific target 
groups. For example, buyers of components associated with higher 
sustainability risks were given an intensive training program in a 
separate format. Since 2017, we have trained our procurement em-
ployees to deal with the special challenges found in battery supply 
chains.
To facilitate ongoing supplier development, we make an e-learning 
module on sustainability available to all current suppliers, as well 
as to Volkswagen Group procurement staff, in the nine languages 
of the countries which have been defined as compliance risks. By 
the end of the reporting year, more than 33,000 suppliers – repre-
senting 64% of the sales revenue of suppliers of our procurement 
volume – had completed the e-learning module. The content of the 
e-learning module was revised in 2019. We are planning to make a 
newly developed learning program available for 2020.
Alongside the e-learning format, we also conduct issue-specific sus-
tainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers at 
selected locations. During the reporting period, events were held in 
countries including Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Poland, 
Sweden and South Africa. In total, the awareness of around 1,500 
personnel employed by some 1,100 of our suppliers was raised on 
sustainability issues at these events. In addition, we also work with 
industry initiatives and in cooperation with other companies on 
equipping our suppliers to better manage sustainability.
42
The basis for cooperative work relations characterized by social 
harmony includes the Volkswagen Group’s agreements which were 
made with the Group European Works Council and Global Group 
Works Council. They offer our employees certainty as regards their 
employee and human rights. In essence, this includes their right to 
freedom of association, their right to collective negotiations and 
equal pay, and the banning of discrimination at work.
Relevant international standards for the business and human rights 
focus area by which we orient ourselves include in particular:
• The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
which is codified in the International Covenant on Civil and 
 Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights
• The Core Labor Standards of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO)
• The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
• The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
In the last few years, a trend of also regulating the issue of business 
and human rights in national laws has been emerging in leading 
economic powers. Volkswagen, as a global business, also observes 
such national requirements that put international standards in 
concrete form. One example of this is the UK Modern Slavery Act 
2015: we publish a corresponding Group statement on this on our 
website annually. In Germany, we support the German federal gov-
ernment’s National Action Plan (NAP) for Business and Human 
Rights.
In 2019, the Volkswagen Group laid down the respective key focal 
points, the so-called “Salient Business & Human Rights Issues” in 
the business and human rights focus area in the three categories 
of labor, tolerance and security in the sense of the UN Guiding 
Principles:
• Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
•  No forced labor
•  No child labor
• Good working conditions
• No involvement in any unlawful activities 
•  Guarantee of the security of people
•  Tolerance towards different – ideological and religious – opinions 
and respectful expression of them
•  No discrimination
•  Diversity, protection of disadvantaged, particularly indigenous 
groups 
CLEAR REQUIREMENTS IN THE CODE OF CONDUCT
Our expectations of our employees and our Group-wide under-
standing of the observance of universal human rights are also set 
out in our Code of Conduct. The issue of human rights is covered in 
the chapter on “Our responsibilities as a member of society”.
Our Code of Conduct and additional topic-related Group policies 
apply to the employees of all brands, companies and hierarchy lev-
els around the world.
Our employees are trained for this. We use real-life examples to il-
lustrate the individual issues and help employees put the Code of 
Conduct’s rules into practice. Over and above the Code of Conduct, 
our human rights responsibility does not end at the factory gate: we 
also pay attention to the influence our business activities have on 
our neighborhood, local communities and society. We enter into 
dialogs with our stakeholders whenever possible and where neces-
sary take measures to live up to our corporate responsibility for hu-
man rights and effectively protect these.
INTEGRATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO COMPLIANCE
The Volkswagen Group Board of Management has decided to meet 
its responsibility regarding human rights by integrating the busi-
ness and human rights focus area into its compliance management 
system. This integration strengthens the significance of the topic and 
establishes clear standards. We want to understand human rights 
risks and thus make human rights violations within and outside the 
Group transparent, avoid them as preventively as possible and in the 
case of an occurrence, discover them and respond appropriately.
The Volkswagen compliance management system for human 
rights is based on seven elements:
•  Culture and values, e.g. through the integration of the topic into 
strategic documents and Group policies
•  Objectives, e.g. the already announced focuses of work in the 
business and human rights focus area
•  Risk-based approach in the context of systematic analysis and 
uniform Group-wide measures
•  Efficient programs and processes in the business and human 
rights focus area, e.g. the sustainability rating (“S rating”), with 
which we audit our suppliers’ sustainability performance and 
show opportunities for continuous improvement
 
 Responsibility > Supply Chain
•  Group-wide compliance through a global organization structure 
and the establishment of a business and human rights center of 
competence
•  Communication and trainings, particularly, for example, for rais-
ing awareness among employees and management and our busi-
ness partners
•  Monitoring and continuous improvement, e.g. through 
 reporting and organizational feedback as part of rankings
At the moment, content-related, procedural and organizational 
preparations are being made in order to be able to successfully con-
clude the integration of the topic of business and human rights into 
the Volkswagen Group’s compliance management system.

MOBILITY CONCEPTS
Our global society today in particular faces the major challenge 
of finding the right balance when shaping mobility. At the mo-
ment, the spectrum simultaneously ranges from massive over-
loading on the one hand to glaring deficits on the other. The lim-
its for greenhouse gas emissions, noise, traffic jams, accidents or 
poor air quality have been reached or exceeded in many major 
cities. At the same time, there is too little mobility for many peo-
ple, limiting their access to and participation in society. This af-
fects people who cannot pay for transport options or have no ac-
cess to means of transport due to visual impairments, restricted 
movement or age. This is not only the case in the less developed 
countries around the world, but also in rural areas of industrial-
ized countries and in suburbs.
Against this background, new concepts are needed that replace 
the existing options when it comes to acceptance and perfor-
mance and achieve significant environmental and transport im-
provements. Problem-solving approaches such as carsharing only 
become genuine alternatives for users of existing options and 
part of day-to-day mobility if there are individual advantages in 
journey time, convenience, safety, or costs. Undesirable side ef-
fects must also be factored in if new concepts create additional 
traffic or replace nonmotorized transport.
New solutions therefore need to be measured by a large number 
of relevant social objectives, e.g. the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals. However, there are hardly any universal 
solutions that are environmentally advantageous, economically 
favorable and socially acceptable in equal measure. It is impor-
tant for companies to aim for transparency with regard to the im-
pact of their mobility offerings and also to evaluate possible side 
effects at an early stage. Conflicting objectives must be detected 
and addressed. Weighting the objectives, by contrast, is a task that 
a company cannot determine for itself alone, but only in dialog 
with society and politicians.
As an automotive manufacturer, we traditionally rely on infra-
structure such as roads, gas stations, or parking spaces and on 
their respective providers. On our path to becoming a mobility 
provider with new solutions, the need for connection with other 
players and for cooperation continues to increase. Traffic-effi-
cient driving, for example, only works through the coordinated 
interaction between vehicle and traffic lights or roadworks. Mo-
bility services need “stops” in order to let passengers into and out 
of the vehicle and carsharing services need reliable parking places. 
Integration into the structure of public transport services must 
also be taken into account here. The scope for action for mobility 
solutions is embedded in structural developments. Changes in 
residential, road and rail infrastructure or also new digital tech-
nologies in mobile communications are frequently time-con-
suming and costly. This means dependence on external condi-
tions and decision-makers increases, but various opportunities 
and approaches to cooperation also present themselves on the 
road towards new mobility concepts.
Digitalization is the engine for opening up important future po-
tential in mobility – and this does not just apply to the product 
level and the implementation of innovative mobility concepts. 
Manufacturing companies themselves can also generate consid-
erable efficiency gains with digitally connected processes at all 
value chain stages under the guiding principle of Industry 4.0. 
The digitalization of products and manufacturing in turn relies 
on the exchange of large quantities of data. This requires efficient 
infrastructure and compliance with strict regulations that guar-
antee a high level of IT security and the protection of data from 
customers, partners and employees.

New Mobility Concepts 
STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE AND DIGITALLY MANAGED 
MOBILITY
The Volkswagen Group is actively evolving from an automotive 
manufacturer to a provider of sustainable mobility. We are bridg-
ing the gap between innovative vehicle technologies and futuris-
tic service concepts which are geared to customers’ requirements 
but can also help to solve environmental and traffic problems in 
urban and rural areas around the globe.
We are guided here by the “Shaping mobility – for generations to 
come” vision underlying our TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy. 
Our goal: to shape mobility to be sustainable for us and for gener-
ations to come. With electric drives, digital connectivity and au-
tonomous driving, we want to make the automobile cleaner, 
more quiet, more intelligent and safer. In climate protection too, 
it is becoming part of the solution. This means the car can remain 
a cornerstone of contemporary, individual and affordable mobili-
ty in the future.
Digitalization is fundamentally changing the car and increasingly 
turning it into a software product. It will become even more a part 
of our customers’ digital world in the future. Requirements for the 
digital performance of cars will continue to increase. In addition, 
the cross-linking of electrics and electronics is extremely complex 
and costly. We therefore need to better manage the complexity and 
become even more efficient. We are not yet one of the big players 
in software. That is why we are working on developing software 
competence into a core competence of the Volkswagen Group. To 
this end, we are pooling our existing strengths and enormously 
strengthening our workforce. We are the first automotive manu-
facturer to have separated hardware and software development 
organizationally. We are developing a cross-brand software plat-
form for vehicles and also the Volkswagen Automotive Cloud. The 
plan is that all new vehicle models across the Group will be built 
on an in-house software platform by 2025. It has the potential to 
set standards in the industry. Furthermore, we will additionally 
invest €4 billion in developing our IT by 2023. We are thus on the 
way to becoming a tech company and are going to establish our-
selves as a software-enabled car company.

Digitalization is also connected with a number of challenges in the 
area of human resources for the Volkswagen Group. For example, 
jobs previously involving manual work will disappear as a result of 
greater penetration of IT in manufacturing. On the other hand, we 
will need numerous new employees with digital skills, whose re-
cruitment is made harder due to a significant IT skills shortage in 
the labor market. In our human resources policy, we have set an 
important course that meets changed requirements through the 
pooling of our digital expertise at the Volkswagen Group’s “We 
Campus” in Berlin, modern recruitment processes and the Digital 
Transformation Roadmap launched in 2019.
 
 People > Training
The trust of our customers is particularly important for a success-
ful transformation to a provider of sustainable mobility. The motto 
of our sales strategy is “Customer Delight”. This means achieving 
the highest level of customer satisfaction possible. In order to be 
able to measure and manage this, we collect data on two strategic 
indicators for the major passenger car-producing brands: loyalty 
rate and conquest rate. In the case of our financial services, we also 
measure customer satisfaction.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF MOBILITY SOLUTIONS
The complexity of the mobility system means it is not easy to pre-
dict whether new concepts will make a contribution to achieving 
sustainability goals and what underlying conditions need to exist 
for this. Unlike, for example, when developing new vehicles, it is 
not possible simply to build and test prototypes. Instead, interac-
tions with the mobility system in a relatively large area must be 
taken into account. Volkswagen addresses this challenge with an 
impact assessment. Mobility is digitally replicated on the basis of 
real data. Models are developed and simulations run in order to be 
able to evaluate the effects of solutions as early as possible. Various 
key figures that are not only scientifically acknowledged but also 
reflect the requirements of various players are used in the evalua-
tion. For example, short journey times are important for custom-
ers, the reduction of CO2 emissions and improving air quality are 
important for society and good utilization of its offering is impor-
tant for the operator.
The simulations are conducted at different levels in line with the is-
sue under consideration.  At the highest level, the mobility require-
ments of a whole city with its surrounding areas are reproduced. 
This issue is then modeled for a realistic base case with current modes 
of transport, e.g. car, bicycle, walking, bus and train. Local improve-
ments, e.g. to intersections, can be viewed at a more microscopic 
level. As a result of the simulation, possible improvements – or also 
undesirable side effects – can be made visible.
Measures for increasing efficiency in road traffic are important 
steps on the path to sustainable mobility for Volkswagen. The im-
pact assessment in the reporting year therefore focused on topics 
including ride pooling and traffic light assistance systems. Studies 
show that new mobility solutions move between traffic efficiency 
and journey time attractiveness in a complex field of tension. Mo-
bility options offering journey times similar to the car only have a 
limited time to pick up further passengers. Furthermore, it was also 
shown that ride hailing services can reduce traffic from people 
looking for parking spaces, but overall do not lead to a substantial 
reduction in driving. Only by sharing journeys, e.g. in MOIA’s 
ride-pooling service, can driving be reduced and therefore also 
traffic congestion. A reliable service with high service quality that 
also reaches customers over a wide area requires proactive, strategic 
positioning of the fleet. As a result, it is possible, for example, to 
reach commuters at the periphery of towns and cities who have 
previously had to rely on a car due to insufficient public transport 
services. Intelligent filling of gaps in public transport services thus 
creates a key prerequisite for efficient and sustainable road trans-
port in the future.
We have carried out another impact assessment related to intersec-
tions with traffic lights. These have a decisive impact on traffic 
quality in cities, e.g. in the form of lost time and emissions as a re-
sult of traffic jams. Traffic efficiency can only be increased here 
through information being shared between infrastructure and ve-
hicles. Information obtained in the vehicle through a forecast of 
the traffic light phases is decisive for this. The forecast can be pro-
vided by the digitalized infrastructure through wireless communi-
cation. The vehicle driving up to the intersection with traffic lights 
can thus make an optimal adaptation to the signal change. This 
avoids the time and energy-inefficient maneuvers of braking and 
starting vehicles, thus reducing fuel/energy consumption and im-
proving traffic flow.
WORLDWIDE CITY PARTNERSHIPS
Shaping urban mobility plays a key role for the Volkswagen Group 
because many mobility options are primarily available in cities. Ac-
cording to the UN’s estimates, almost 70% of the global population 
will live in cities by 2050. The problems are the most urgent and at 
the same time the potential for change is the greatest here. As a 
member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop-
ment for many years, we seek a dialog with other transformative 
companies and other stakeholders in order to identify our own 
scope for action. The Volkswagen Group is currently collaborating 
on the “Transforming Urban Mobility” (TUM) project. At the same 
time, we use stakeholder dialog events at a Group level, for instance 
the event that took place in Wolfsburg in June 2019. Topics such as 
the future of mobility in cities were high on the agenda there.

D I G I TA L
The Volkswagen Group sees itself as a close and reliable partner to 
cities. A wide variety of projects is already being developed, tested 
and implemented in numerous collaborations around the world. 
Our Group has now initiated 12 city partnerships. These include 
Hamburg, Hanover, Dresden and Wolfsburg in Germany and cities 
such as Prague and Barcelona internationally.
Together with the city of Hanover, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
manages the urban logistics initiative and avoids any gap at the 
end of the line. The goal is to realize clean, quiet, effective and thus 
future-proof logistics concepts for cities. An analysis of urban com-
mercial transport is currently being conducted in order to identify 
optimization potential and to assess the effect of new concepts in 
advance. Together with industrial and academic partners, practical 
research findings on innovative solutions in cities are being devel-
oped in the national funded projects USEfUL (German Federal Min-
istry of Education and Research) and ZUKUNFT.DE (German Federal 
Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure). Moreover, emis-
sion-free package delivery is being tested with parcel delivery pro-
viders using e-Crafters and Cargo e-bikes in a pilot project in the 
Linden Nord district of Hanover.
Particularly intense cooperation connects the Volkswagen Group 
to the Hanseatic City of Hamburg and to Dresden, the capital city of 
the German state of Saxony, which are both being developed as 
model cities for sustainable and integrated urban mobility. Pro-
moting electric mobility, innovative mobility services, the intelli-
gent connection of transport and the use of self-driving vehicles 
are at the heart of the partnership with Hamburg. In April 2019, the 
ride-sharing service MOIA was launched in all-electric operating 
mode in Hamburg. From spring 2020 onward, Volkswagen will also 
launch its all-electric carsharing service WeShare in the city. The 
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) World Congress, which Hamburg 
is organizing in 2021, will be another milestone of the collabora-
tion between Hamburg and the Volkswagen Group. Germany had 
successfully applied to organize the congress with Hamburg, with 
the support of the Volkswagen Group as one of its main partners.
Under the “mobility of the future” mission statement, we advanced 
the collaboration with Dresden, the capital city of Saxony, in the ar-
eas of electric mobility, connected driving and the development of 
software for innovative mobility solutions. With the functional 
testing station, Volkswagen has brought a new research and devel-
opment entity to Dresden, which focuses on testing driver assis-
tance systems. Furthermore, innovative projects in the field of mo-
bility are advanced in the startup incubator.
The city government is also gradually stocking its fleet with electric 
vehicles. There has been an official mobility point of the city at the 
Gläserne Manufaktur since April 2019. By 2022, more than 70 such 
mobility points, which will combine tram and bus stops, bikes for 
rent, carsharing and charging stations for electric cars and e-bikes, 
are to be created. The project partners are targeting an expansion of 
the charging infrastructure to up to 400 charging points by 2022. 
In addition, Volkswagen has opened the Future Mobility Campus, 
the first school laboratory for electric mobility in Dresden. 
In addition to the valuable collaboration in the partnerships, the 
Volkswagen Group already offers cities a large number of solutions 
especially for the urban area – for example e-micromobility vehi-
cles both for transporting people and for transporting goods (the 
eXS KickScooter from SEAT and the Cargo e-bike from Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles). A wide variety of mobility-on-demand solu-
tions, such as MOIA (e-ride sharing), WeShare from Volkswagen 
(e-carsharing) and BeRider from ŠKODA (e-scooter sharing) addi-
tionally mean less congestion and more room in cities. In order to 
supplement the portfolio in the area of electric vehicles and servic-
es, the Group also offers energy and charging solutions with Elli. 
With its product and service portfolio, the Group aims to help cities 
shape sustainable urban mobility.
MOIA: SHARED USE OF TRANSPORT SERVICES
Shared journeys ease the burden on traffic and the environment in 
urban areas. With MOIA, we offer shared on-demand mobility ser-
vices (ride sharing) in Germany. Instead of using their own cars, 
people travel to their destination with other passengers all traveling 
in the same direction. With its ride-sharing service, MOIA comple-
ments existing public rail and bus routes in a practical, inexpensive 
manner and offers an attractive alternative to private cars.
MOIA launched regular operations throughout Hanover in Febru-
ary 2019 and in Hamburg in April 2019. Within 12 months, MOIA 
shall be expanded in Hamburg to become one of the largest fully 
electric ride-sharing services in Europe. Hamburg is a global flag-
ship project for MOIA. It is the first city with a population of more 
than a million where we have put our offering for innovative, 
shared mobility on the road. MOIA sees itself as part of the in-
ner-city mobility offering and as a meaningful addition to local 
public transport. The Group is cooperating with Hamburg and the 
public transport operator Hamburger Hochbahn.
More than 900 drivers have been hired and specially trained at 
MOIA in Hamburg so far. As of the end of 2019, 1,200 people were 
employed there, including not just driving and operating staff, but 
more than 150 people in the field of IT development. A fleet of 100 
fully electric MOIA vehicles were deployed with the launch. These 
cover a 200 km² operating area including Hamburg Airport. During 
2020, the operating area should gradually increase to 300 km² and 
the fleet to 500 vehicles.

AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IS BECOMING REALITY 
Autonomous driving is a key issue in our transformation from an 
automotive manufacturer to a provider of sustainable mobility. A 
concept based on heavily used autonomous vehicles will not only 
require less space and energy – it will also be much safer. We would 
like to make automated driving accessible to everyone, everywhere.
We are already starting series production of partly automated driv-
er assistance systems. Innovative parking features make day-to-day 
urban life easier, safety features save human lives in critical situa-
tions. One example of this is Emergency Assist, which starts a safety 
program as a rescue assistant in the case of medical emergencies 
when driver inactivity is detected. In addition, there is Adaptive 
Cruise Control to enable comfortable and safe driving in traffic jams.
In 2019 Volkswagen Autonomy (VWAT GmbH) was founded as a 
center of competence for autonomous driving based in Munich 
and Wolfsburg, in order to develop the technology to market readi-
ness. More sites in North America and China are planned for 2020 
and 2021. The business models for autonomous driving, such as 
mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and transport-as-a-service (TaaS) are 
designed under the leadership of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. 
The aim is to be able to offer the customer a custom mobility 
solution.
The Volkswagen Group will in future work more intensively with 
partners on future technical challenges – from algorithms through 
sensor technology to cyber security. In July 2019, we announced 
closer collaboration with Ford in the field of autonomous driving. 
This includes – subject to approval by the authorities – an invest-
ment in ARGO AI, a company that specializes in software platforms 
for autonomous driving.
At the start of 2019, a pilot project was launched in Hamburg on a 
nine km circuit in the city area. This means the autonomous over-
all package will be tested on the roads of Hamburg, which are full 
of traffic lights, turn lanes and road signs and are used by other 
road users, such as truck drivers, car drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists 
and pedestrians. Around the middle of the decade, we want to start 
the commercialization of autonomous driving on a large scale.
DIGITALIZATION AND CUSTOMER CONCERNS
VOLKSWAGEN WE AS A DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM 
“Volkswagen We” is a growing range of vehicle-related digital ser-
vices and mobility offerings that can be used in the car or with a 
smartphone. These include apps for cashless parking and charging 
(“WeCharge”), opening your own car for delivery services and 
cleaning (""We Deliver”), simple and convenient parking (“WePark”) 
and the all-electric carsharing service “WeShare”.
With “WeShare”, we want to participate in the still growing carsharing 
market in Germany and at the same time assume environmental 
responsibility. With 1,500 e-Golf vehicles, the Volkswagen brand 
has put an all-electric fleet on the road in Berlin, all of which is 
powered by green energy. This should be followed by 500 additional 
e-up! vehicles at the start of 2020 and the first models of the new 
all-electric Volkswagen model after the launch of the ID.3 in mid-2020. 
An expansion of “WeShare” to Prague and then Hamburg is planned 
in 2020, initially jointly with ŠKODA.
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AS A KEY TOPIC  
“WeShare” will use Berlin’s public network of charging stations to 
charge its fleet, including charging points to be created at 70 stores 
of supermarket chains Lidl and Kaufland. Volkswagen has conclud-
ed a partnership with the companies of the Schwarz Group in order 
to ensure the operation of Volkswagen’s electric fleet and to drive 
the expansion of charging infrastructure in public places.
If e-mobility is to achieve a breakthrough, it remains the case that 
there must be an accessible, available charging infrastructure geared 
to people’s needs as well as a customer-friendly charging procedure. 
Our charging strategy is based on around 50% of e-vehicle charging 
taking place at customers’ homes in the future, 20% at their work-
place, 5% along highways and no less than 25% in public places. We 
are already equipping private homes and workplaces with charging 
systems via our subsidiary Elli (Electric Life) and are working to-
wards the development of a fast-charging network on major Euro-
pean highways under the IONITY umbrella. By 2020, 400 stations 
will be in operation.
The Volkswagen brand aims to install around 4,000 charging 
points at its German sites by 2025. The Group is investing around 
€250 million across the Group in the expansion of charging infra-
structure at its European sites. Together with the activities of deal-
ers, around 36,000 new charging points are to be created in Europe.
Sufficient charging options at work are an important element of 
our electric offensive. Our employees should in the future be able 
to charge their electric vehicle easily and conveniently while at 
work. The first charging center was put into operation with 60 charg-
ing points at Volkswagen Group Components in Braunschweig in 
2019. Setting up charging centers is also lucrative for companies 
because they frequently have favorable structural conditions and 
can create additional benefit for their employees. In light of this, 
Volkswagen is not only active at its own sites, but also offers com-
plete charging solutions for employee parking spaces and fleets to 
other companies through its subsidiary Elli.

D I G I TA L
DIGITALIZATION THROUGH CAR.SOFTWARE AND THE 
AUTOMOTIVE CLOUD
The proportion of software in cars is rising rapidly and as a result is 
a key influence on the performance and characteristics of our vehi-
cles. That is why we are going to fundamentally strengthen soft-
ware development. We will now transfer our Group’s platform ex-
pertise in hardware to software. The aim is to develop cross-brand 
uniform software architecture. In a Group-wide fleet of more than 
ten million fully connected new vehicles, the software costs for 
each individual vehicle will decrease considerably.
To this end, we set a decisive course in 2019. Christian Senger has 
been the Member of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars Board of Man-
agement with responsibility for the newly created Digital Car & Ser-
vices function since March 2019. He has also been appointed Head 
of the Digital Car & Services function for the Group. Senger thus as-
sumes overall responsibility for the coordination and design of the 
Volkswagen Group’s digital activities, including software. The new 
Board function is tasked with bundling software activities and 
strengthening the digital overall experience through the custom-
er-centric development of Group brands. At the same time, the 
Volkswagen Group is to become a particularly attractive employer 
for digital experts and talents.
By 2025, we want to group together the skills of thousands of digital 
experts in the areas of software development, electrical and elec-
tronics development, connectivity, automated driving, user experi-
ence (UX), cloud architecture and e-commerce Group-wide in our 
newly established “Car.Software” unit. Our Group plans to develop 
significantly more software in the car and for vehicle-related ser-
vices itself and to boost the in-house share of software development 
from the current figure of less than 10% to at least 60% by 2025.
In the future, there will be one uniform software platform with all 
the basic functions for all vehicles throughout the Group. This will 
consist of the vw.os vehicle operating system and the Volkswagen 
Automotive Cloud. The plan is that all new models of the Group will 
be built on this software platform by 2025. The first vehicle based 
on this software platform will be the ID.3. We are thus creating the 
conditions to meet customer expectations of further increasing 
digital performance from our vehicles.
The Volkswagen Automotive Cloud will be the global technological 
backbone of our digital ecosystem. It serves to link vehicles, a cloud- 
based platform and customer-oriented services provided by all 
brands. We have been developing the Automotive Cloud since 2018 
in strategic partnership with Microsoft.
The Volkswagen Automotive Cloud will gradually be expanded to 
other regions of the world and thus be available in Europe, China 
and the USA – the core markets for the future all-electric and fully 
connected ID model family. In addition, Volkswagen and Microsoft 
are already working on the first flagship projects for connected 
vehicle services, and the establishment of Volkswagen’s first devel-
opment center in North America is progressing rapidly.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AREAS OF APPLICATION
Artificial intelligence is increasingly gaining industrial relevance 
for the Volkswagen Group and is already a competitive factor. The 
Group has therefore already created the conditions to be able to de-
velop and use powerful AI systems itself at an early stage. The an-
chor point for the topic of artificial intelligence in the Volkswagen 
Group is the Data:Lab Munich, which was founded in 2013. Here, 
around 100 specialists advance research and development on appli-
cations of machine learning and data analytics. The teams in the 
Data:Lab have now developed more than 100 AI applications, many 
of which are being tested in various divisions.
Artificial intelligence is relevant for the Volkswagen Group in two 
major subject areas: in the vehicle and in business processes. The 
key is AI for autonomous driving that is based on the use of self- 
learning algorithms for environment and environmental recogni-
tion. Another area of application in the vehicle is natural language 
processing (NLP) – enhanced, intelligent voice control, for example 
for navigation and convenience functions.
In the Group itself, “cognitive ergonomics” is particularly important. 
This is what we call the use of self-learning algorithms that remove 
repetitive administrative work from employees and prepare it for the 
final decision. The use of AI for preparing information is also sensible: 
algorithms can search and organize highly complex quantities of 
data quickly, efficiently and continuously. This enables, for example, 
precise market forecasts that include a large number of variables.
Another important area of application is enabling intelligent ro-
bots to work hand-in-hand with human specialists. It is also a mat-
ter of powerful algorithms that can optimize manufacturing and 
logistics processes even more efficiently than has yet been possible. 
One example of this is predictive maintenance.
DIGITALIZATION OF DATA IN THE INDUSTRIAL CLOUD 
In the course of digitalization, the trend towards automation will 
continue to intensify in the future. Using this potential beyond 
borders in the Volkswagen Group will require the ability to process 
and utilize a large amount of technical data. To this end, the 
Group and Amazon Web Services have concluded a multi-year 
agreement to jointly develop this project. In the future, data from 
all the machinery, equipment and systems at all 124 Volkswagen 
Group factories will be combined in the Volkswagen Industrial 
Cloud. This facilitates more efficient control of material flow, the 
early detection and correction of supply bottlenecks and process 
disruptions, and the optimized operation of machinery and 
equipment in all factories.
52
The cloud-based platform as a standardized technical basis with 
its simplified data exchange is also a key prerequisite for provid-
ing innovations quickly and across multiple locations. Examples 
include smart robotics or functions of data analytics in order to 
analyze and compare cross-plant processes. Volkswagen encrypts 
all the data compiled in the Industrial Cloud. The Group is setting 
the highest standards for this. The Volkswagen Group and Ama-
zon Web Services have decided to have the Deutsche Cyber-Sicher-
heitsorganisation (DCSO) in Berlin lead the way in developing the 
architecture for the cyber-security solutions needed.
The Industrial Cloud will continue to ensure the integration of the 
Volkswagen Group’s global supply chain with more than 30,000 
locations and of over 1,500 suppliers and partner companies in 
the future. Together with Amazon Web Services, we are therefore 
creating the Industrial Cloud as an open industry platform that 
other partners from industry, logistics and sales can use in the fu-
ture. This will create a steadily growing global industrial ecosys-
tem. At the end of 2019, the first version of the Volkswagen Indus-
trial Cloud was put into operation with concrete services and 
functions.
BUNDLING DIGITAL KNOWHOW 
We will also ensure our digital transformation through a forward- 
looking HR strategy. In 2019, Volkswagen opened the “We Campus” 
in Berlin, which brings together around 900 experts from the Group 
and its technology partners who previously worked at different lo-
cations. The cross-functional team includes product developers, 
software engineers and UX designers. In the future, they will devel-
op digital added-value services and mobility services there that can 
be offered in the “Volkswagen We” ecosystem. At the new location, 
Volkswagen AG and its strategic partner diconium as well as UMI 
Urban Mobility International, Volkswagen Group Services and Elli, 
the Volkswagen Naturstrom® provider, will all join forces. In addi-
tion, the new Campus will in the future play an important role as 
a development center for the new “Car.Software” unit of the 
Volkswagen Group and be available as a location for the Group 
brands.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATA PROTECTION 
The topics of information security and data protection require the 
greatest sensitivity in the face of accelerated digitalization. One of 
the ways in which Volkswagen has adapted to these challenges is by 
expanding sustainable data protection organization. Given the 
complexity of data processing, the establishment of and compli-
ance with high organizational and legal standards is necessary. Ex-
perts at a broad range of levels in the Group’s companies are work-
ing on connecting practical and legal aspects of new technologies 
with each other in a qualitatively sustainable way. In a technical 
world of constant updates, orderly life-cycle management is needed 
in order to master the complexity of the data processing.
HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IN ALL BUSINESS AREAS
GRI 203-2
We regard ourselves as an innovative and sustainable mobility pro-
vider for all commercial and private customers worldwide – with a 
unique product portfolio encompassing twelve successful brands 
and innovative financial services.
Together with their sales partners and importers, our passenger car 
brands have agreed on a procedure for integrating innovative prod-
ucts and services into the sales network. The priority is safe han-
dling of customer data and the way in which this is processed for 
digital products and services or in connection with the vehicle pur-
chase. The legal requirements for handling customer data have 
been tightened in many countries. At the same time, new Group ve-
hicles that are permanently connected to the Internet are about to 
be launched. We are increasingly investing in distribution systems 
and processes with the goal of further digitalizing and improving 
the individual customer experience in all distribution channels.
The economic power and profitability of the Volkswagen Group is 
based on a broad portfolio of strong brands. The objective of our 
Best Brand Equity strategic module is to continuously sharpen the 
brand profiles and demarcate the vehicle segments serving the 
brands as clearly as possible. In this way, we want to achieve high 
market coverage with great efficiency and low cannibalization of 
the respective brands. Market positioning is an important element 
for increasing brand values. To this end, we are establishing auto-
mobile-specific customer segmentation to steer the positioning of 
our brands. It will be continuously applied in the strategy and prod-
uct process.
The Volkswagen Group aims its sales activities at exciting its cus-
tomers. This is our top priority, as enthusiastic customers remain 
loyal to our brands and recommend our products and services to 
others. In addition to satisfaction with our products and services, 
we value our customers’ emotional connection to our brands. It is 
important for us to retain customers and win new ones. To meas-
ure our success in this area, we compile and analyze two strategic 
indicators for the passenger car-producing brands.
• Loyalty rate: Proportion of customers of our passenger car 
brands who have bought another Group model. The loyalty of 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche and ŠKODA customers 
has kept these brands in the upper rankings in the core European 
markets in comparison with competitors for a number of years, 
even though the Group brands have seen a slight decrease in the 
loyalty rate. Compared to other manufacturer groups, the 
Volkswagen Group continues to hold a top spot in the core Euro-
pean markets in terms of loyalty, with a considerable margin 
over the competition.
• Conquest rate: Newly acquired passenger car customers as a pro-
portion of all potential new customers. Here, too, the Volkswagen 
Group has a top ranking, primarily thanks to the good scores 
achieved by the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand.
53
D I G I TA L
In the core European markets, Volkswagen Passenger Cars’ scores 
for brand image and brand trust continued to stabilize in 2019. 
Porsche remains in a top position in the image ranking.
In the financial services business, we use two strategic indicators:
• Customer satisfaction: Satisfaction of our customers results 
from a customer-oriented product range and the service focus of 
our staff. In the annual measurement, the two aspects are suita-
ble indicators for the critical assessment as to whether we will 
achieve our target of 90% customer satisfaction in 2025. In 2019, 
we were within the expected range with a satisfaction rate of 
83% (82%). Our goal is to satisfy our customers completely. To do 
so, we are developing suitable measures at country level.
• Customer loyalty: Trust in and loyalty to our services rely on 
customer satisfaction with our product range and service. The 
new contract rates determined to date based on product sales to 
our customers – financing and leasing agreements for purchases 
of new Volkswagen Group vehicles – are being revised in the con-
text of changing customer needs and the development of the 
product offering at our financial services companies. 
As part of the Best Brand Equity module of the TOGETHER 2025+ 
Group strategy, a greater focus is being put on the establishment 
and management of the brands and of brand equity, i.e. the value 
of the brand, in all brands. Implementing the individual brands’ 
brand strategies will allow us to communicate with our target 
groups in a way that is even more targeted and even more relevant 
to customers and enable us to deliver a better brand and product 
experience to them.
The individual brands will be responsible for the implementation 
of the brand strategy. The Group will assume a supervisory role and 
ensure that the brand strategies are implemented optimally and 
that the individual brands are differentiated from each other in or-
der to offer every customer the right vehicle from the right brand.
FLEET CUSTOMER BUSINESS
Business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term 
partnerships. In a volatile environment, this customer group guar-
antees more stable vehicle sales than the private customer 
segment.
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet 
customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular. Our ex-
tensive product range enables us to satisfy their individual mobili-
ty needs from a single source.
In the German passenger car market, which expanded as a whole 
by 5.0% in 2019, the share of fleet customers in total registrations 
was 14.8% (13.6%). The Volkswagen Group’s share of this customer 
segment increased slightly to 44.1% (44.0%). Outside Germany, the 
Group’s share of registrations by fleet customers in Europe was up 
slightly at 25.6% (25.2%). The upward trend shows that fleet custom-
ers still have considerable confidence in the Group.
AFTER SALES AND SERVICE
In addition to individual service, the timely provision of genuine 
parts is essential in ensuring passenger car customer satisfaction 
in after sales. The genuine parts supplied by our passenger car 
brands and the expertise of the service centers represent quality 
and ensure the safety and value retention of our customers’ vehi-
cles. With our global after-sales network including more than 130 
of our own warehouses, we ensure that almost all our authorized 
service facilities around the world can be supplied within 24 hours. 
We regard ourselves as a complete provider of all products and ser-
vices relevant to customers in the after-sales business. Together 
with our partners, we ensure the worldwide mobility of our cus-
tomers. The partner businesses offer the entire portfolio of services 
in all vehicle classes. We are continuously expanding our range of 
tailored services in order to improve convenience for our custom-
ers and increase customer satisfaction.
In the Digital After Sales project, we are modernizing processes and 
IT systems in After Sales. By adopting an approach that focuses 
product and service development on the specific needs of both 
dealers and customers, we aim to reduce the time needed for ad-
ministrative tasks at the dealers through automated, interrelated 
services and also stabilize existing IT systems and boost efficiency. 
Innovative digital after-sales services will additionally improve the 
customer experience.
Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also prides it-
self on products of quality and on customer focus. Our range of 
trucks, buses and engines is complemented by services that guar-
antee fuel efficiency, reliability and good vehicle availability. The 
workshop service and service contracts offer customers a high de-
gree of certainty, in addition to a high level of quality. We are re-
ducing servicing times and costs with a view to the vehicles’ total 
operating costs and helping to retain their value. 
In the Power Engineering segment, we help our customers ensure 
the availability of machinery with MAN PrimeServ. The global net-
work of more than 100 PrimeServ locations guarantees excellent 
customer focus and offers, among other things, replacement parts 
of genuine-parts quality, qualified technical service and long-term 
maintenance contracts.

COMMITMENT TO AN UNDAMAGED ENVIRONMENT
We realize that the production and use of our vehicles pose risks for 
the environment and can have a negative impact on it. In light of 
climate change, the threat to air quality in urban areas and the use 
of natural resources, we must also refocus and transform our core 
business to take into account environmental needs.
Environmental protection is not only a central goal of our TOGETHER 
2025+ Group strategy, we want to be a “role model as regards envi-
ronment”. At the same time, the environmental compatibility of 
our products and processes is one of our Group Essentials. With 
electric drives, digital connectivity and autonomous driving, we 
want to make the automobile cleaner, more quiet, more intelligent 
and safer. We use our globally connected innovative power in order 
to reduce our environmental footprint – over the entire life cycle of 
our products and mobility solutions. Our innovations at the same 
time help our customers to be more environmentally friendly. They 
also make a significant contribution to maintaining our competi-
tiveness and to job security, which we want to universally guaran-
tee with site-related agreements and training programs despite the 
challenges of technological change.
THE“GOTOZERO” MISSION STATEMENT: MINIMIZING OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
The Volkswagen Group bundles all its measures in environmental 
protection under the new “goTOzero” environmental mission state-
ment. This concept sets the agenda for a way of doing business that 
is as environmentally friendly and with a footprint that is as carbon- 
free as possible. The Volkswagen Group has set itself the Group-wide 
goal of achieving this by 2050.
Specifically, the environmental mission statement says: “For all our 
products and mobility solutions we aspire to minimize environ-
mental impacts along the entire life cycle – from raw material ex-
traction to end-of-life – in order to keep ecosystems intact and to 
create positive impacts on society. Compliance with environmental 
regulations, standards and voluntary commitments is a basic pre-
requisite of our actions.” This environmental mission statement 
combines all strategic and compliance-related aspects of the Group’s 
environmental activities for the first time and forms the basis for 
linking targets, key performance indicators, programs and measures.
In its “goTOzero” mission statement, the Volkswagen Group con-
centrates on four action areas.
• Climate change: Volkswagen is committed to complying with 
the United Nations’ Paris Agreement. The goal is to become a 
company with a carbon-neutral footprint by 2050. As early as by 
2025, the Group plans to reduce the total life-cycle greenhouse 
gas emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
by 30% compared to 2015. The Group will also actively drive the 
transition towards renewable energies along the entire life cycle.
• Resources: Volkswagen will further improve its resource efficien-
cy and promote reuse and recycling approaches in the areas of 
materials, energy and water. By 2025, the Group plans to have re-
duced the production-related environmental impact with re-
spect to CO2, energy, water, waste and volatile organic com-
pounds by 45% per vehicle compared to 2010.
• Air quality: Volkswagen is also driving e-mobility forward to im-
prove local air quality. By 2025, the proportion of electric vehi-
cles in the model portfolio will be between 20 and 25%. The pro-
portion of electric vehicles in the new passenger car fleet in 
Europe and China is to rise to at least 40% by 2030.
• Environmental compliance: With respect to integrity, 
Volkswagen aims to set an example for a modern, transparent 
and successful business by installing and monitoring effective 
management systems that cover the environmental impact of its 
mobility solutions across all life-cycle phases.

 Environmental Mission Statement
MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IN MATTERS OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Volkswagen has written an environmental policy for its environ-
mental decision making and for the management of projects and 
its conduct in environmental protection. This sets guiding princi-
ples for the conduct and working methods of managers and em-
ployees with regard to five topics: management conduct, compli-
ance, environmental protection, cooperation with interest groups 
and continuous improvement.
The Group Board of Management is the highest internal decision- 
making level for environmental matters. Both the Volkswagen AG 
Board of Management and the boards of management of the 
brands take account not just of economic, but also social and envi-
ronmental aspects when making important business decisions. 
The Group-wide management of environmental protection is the 
responsibility of the Group Steering Committee for the Environ-
ment and Energy. Other committees manage important individual 
aspects for our products – such as CO2 and exhaust emissions. 
These include the Group Steering Committee for CO2, the Group 
Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance and Exhaust Emissions 
and the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability.
The Volkswagen Group coordinates the activities of the brands, 
which in turn manage measures in the individual regions. In or-
ganizational terms, the brands and companies themselves are re-
sponsible for environmental issues. They define their environmen-
tal protection activities on the basis of the targets, guidelines and 
principles that apply throughout the Group. In order to prove that 
we have met our objectives, we disclose environmental key perfor-
mance indicators annually and report transparently on the prog-
ress of our efforts.
GRI 308-1, 308-2
60
The Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy re-
ports to the Board of Management as to how the measures are pro-
gressing. Environmental officers and experts from throughout the 
Group meet regularly for the Group Environmental Conference in or-
der to optimize the environmental focus along the entire value chain. 
In 2019, 104 of our 124 sites including the central development ar-
eas were certified in accordance with ISO 14001 or EMAS . In terms 
of employee numbers, this equates to approximately 90%. In addi-
tion, 44 production locations have certified their energy manage-
ment systems in accordance with ISO 50001. Since 2009, the “Inte-
gration of Environmental Factors into the Volkswagen Brand’s 
Product Development” model used in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand’s technical development has also been certified to ISO/TR 
14062. SEAT development is certified in accordance with ISO 14006.
Our clear internal requirement is to comply with statutory and le-
gal requirements. In addition, we adhere to our corporate standards 
and objectives. We implement environmental compliance manage-
ment systems to ensure that environmental compliance obliga-
tions are understood and achieved in our business operations. We 
consider disregard of these, fraud or misconduct to be a serious 
compliance breach. Whether our actions conform to the require-
ments of our environmental policy and other environment-related 
Group specifications is evaluated annually and reported to the 
Group Board of Management, to the respective boards of manage-
ment of the brands and to the managing directors of the companies.
LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH DETERMINES ANALYSIS AND ACTIONS
We observe our environmental impact over the entire life cycle and 
all stages of the value chain. This includes the manufacturing proc-
ess with the extraction of raw materials, the manufacture of mate-
rials for the production process, the processes at our suppliers and 
our own production at our sites, the usage phase with vehicle emis-
sions and the necessary provision of fuel and the ultimate recy-
cling of the vehicle at the end of its life cycle. For detailed, ISO- 
standardized life cycle assessments (LCA), we use special LCA software 
with our own LCA database LEAD (Life Cycle Environmental Assess-
ment Database), which makes the exchanging of harmonized data 
throughout the Group and a standardized basis for calculating our 
environmental performance possible. In the next step, we identify 
hot spots in the life cycle and deduce suitable solutions with the 
greatest possible effect. We call this life cycle engineering. In line 
with our life-cycle approach, we involve our suppliers in our efforts 
to minimize our environmental impact early on. As a result, we can 
cover over 79% of production-relevant purchasing volume via the 
CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP).
CLIMATE PROTECTION
EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE CLIMATE
The CO2 emissions humans cause must be reduced as quickly as 
possible in order to protect the climate. Alongside other economic 
sectors, the transport sector, where greenhouse gas emissions are 
rising, also needs to make its contribution. The Volkswagen Group 
faces up to this responsibility and expressly acknowledges the ob-
jectives of the Paris Climate Agreement, which seeks to achieve a 
climate-neutral society by 2050.
In order to achieve this objective, the Group has decided on a com-
prehensive and holistic decarbonization program, which includes 
the whole life cycle of the vehicles. It focuses on a carbon-neutral 
footprint in production as well as in procurement and is geared en-
tirely towards electric mobility. The objective is the complete decar-
bonization of the Group by 2050. As early as by 2025, the carbon 
footprint of the vehicle fleet with passenger cars and light commer-
cial vehicles is to be reduced by 30% compared to 2015. The DCI was 
43.0 t CO2e/vehicle in the reporting year.
 
 Introduction > Decarbonization
MANAGEMENT OF GROUP-WIDE CLIMATE PROTECTION ACTIVITIES
The Group Steering Committees for the Environment and Energy, 
CO2 and WLTP bear decisive responsibility for climate protection. 
Group steering committees are the preferred instrument to deal 
with the complexity of this action area. Product and portfolio top-
ics are managed by the Group product strategy. The Group Steering 
Committee for Sustainability and the Group Steering Committee 
for CO2 provide information to the Group Board of Management at 
least twice a year. The Group Board of Management makes key deci-
sions on topics relevant to climate protection.
The decarbonization program applies to the entire Group, to all 
brands and regions. The Group Steering Committee for Sustainabil-
ity steers the program and objectives. The “Decarbonization Project 
Center” that we founded ourselves and which includes experts 
from all brands and departments is responsible for implementa-
tion. We use a predefined process overseen by the management of 
the Decarbonization Project Center to check measures with which 
we can achieve the objective of decarbonization. All measures are 
bundled in roadmaps and are furnished with corresponding levels 
of implementation.
DECARBONIZATION INDEX MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT
The Volkswagen Group measures progress in the reduction of CO2 
emissions with a decarbonization index (DCI). This figure covers 
major passenger-car manufacturing brands and light commercial 
vehicles in the Group portfolio for the Europe (EU-28, Norway and 
Iceland), China and US regions across their life cycle and is meas-
ured in tonnes of CO2 emissions per vehicle. The DCI includes the 
CO2 emissions from the supply chain, our own production, the 
GRI 308-2
61
T H E  E N V I R O N M E N T
provision of fuel, emissions from 200,000 km of driving and from 
recycling and the remaining Scope 3 categories in accordance with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). These include, for ex-
ample, emissions from employee commuting, business travel or 
new production facilities. The diverse input variables for calculat-
ing the DCI include TÜV-tested life cycle assessments and the fleet 
emission figures to be reported publicly to the authorities in the 
various markets.
USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSES
As a participant in the Mobility Model (MoMo) working group of 
the International Energy Agency (IEA), Volkswagen has contributed 
to the development of the IEA’s various climate scenarios. This in-
cludes, for example, the 2DS scenario, which is based on the devel-
opment trajectory of below two degrees Celsius. 
In order to ensure the objectives of the decarbonization index are 
in line with the Paris Climate Agreement over the entire life cycle, 
Volkswagen used the 2DS scenario for orientation when defining 
the objectives. The results of the scenarios of the Mobility Model 
were combined at a global level with the Volkswagen Group’s exist-
ing data, such as sales forecasts, energy consumption and life cycle 
assessments, and integrated in a company-specific model.
TRANSPARENCY ON CO2 EMISSIONS AND ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION
Every year, we calculate the Group’s carbon footprint with the 
Scope 3 inventory. On this basis, we can determine the success of 
our measures and identify other areas for action. In order to reduce 
Group-wide CO2 emissions, we are beginning by making improve-
ments at our own production sites. Our most effective lever for re-
ducing our global carbon footprint is to optimize CO2 emissions from 
our vehicle fleet. After all, according to the Scope 3 GHG inventory, 
77% of all CO2 emissions are produced during the use phase.
CO2 emissions from Scope 1 and 2 have fallen by more than 35% 
per vehicle for the Group since 2010, thanks to improved energy ef-
ficiency and a reduced-carbon energy supply. Despite the construc-
tion of new production sites, absolute CO2 emissions in the passen-
ger cars and light commercial vehicles category and in the entire 
Group have decreased since 2010. This reduction in the absolute 
volume of emissions goes hand in hand with the decline in direct 
CO2 emissions per vehicle since 2010.
The direct CO2 emissions from company vehicles in our possession 
are not shown separately. Across all production sites, they account 
for approximately 3% of the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions. 
Additional Group CO2-compensation projects are not shown. The 
emissions which occur in the Volkswagen AG power plants for pro-
viding district heating and electricity to third parties are not included 
either. In 2019, these amounted to 382,488 t of CO2.
Since 2010, our total energy consumption has increased as a result 
of a continuous rise in production volumes. At the same time, we 
have been able to reduce energy consumption per vehicle since 2010.
Heat consumption relates to space heating demand for production 
and non-production areas in manufacturing facilities and heating 
demand for technical processes. Since space heating accounts for 
the greater proportion of the total heating demand, weather condi-
tions have a major impact on trends in overall heating demand.
In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Re-
sources Institute (WRI), we have reported CO2 emissions for 13 out 
of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories in 2019. Accordingly, around 93% 
of all Scope 3 emissions are in the “Purchased goods and services” 
and “Usage phase” emissions categories.
The calculation of CO2 emissions in the usage phase of the Scope 3 
GHG inventory is based on a Group fleet value representing the 
global passenger cars and light commercial vehicles fleet in the 
three major regions (Europe [EU-28, Norway and Iceland], USA and 
China²). In order to provide a picture that is as complete as possible, 
we also collect data on emissions in this category that are produced 
during the production and transportation of fuels (“well to tank” 
emissions).
The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (exclud-
ing Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 124 grams of 
CO2 per kilometer¹ in the reporting year and thus complied with 
the 2019 European limit of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer. The 
small year-on-year increase is mainly attributable to increased de-
mand for SUVs. As small-volume manufacturers, the Lamborghini 
and Bentley brands are each considered to have an independent 
fleet for the purposes of European CO2 legislation; each was above 
its individual target. In the United States, the regulation of fleet 
emissions is different to that in Europe, for example in terms of the 
underlying test process, the period of evaluation, which corre-
sponds to the model year rather than the fiscal year, and the calcu-
lation period, which comprises three model years. In the United 
States, we complied with the emissions budget regulations that ap-
ply there in fiscal year 2019 – subject to any response by official 
authorities.
The Volkswagen Group closely coordinates technology and product 
planning with its brands so as to avoid breaches of fleet fuel con-
sumption limits, since these would entail severe financial penalties.
¹ Subject to official publication by the European Commission in the annual CO2 fleet monitoring report.
² Fleet emissions have been calculated on the basis of the rules applicable in China, including taking credits for BEVs and PHEVs into account.

BATTERY CARS HAVE THE LOWEST PRIMARY ENERGY
ROADMAP E CREATES MORE CLIMATE-FRIENDLINESS IN THE 
USAGE PHASE 
We consider electric mobility the most important key to reducing our 
vehicles’ carbon emissions. With an investment volume of €33 billion 
by 2024, we have launched the greatest electrification drive in the 
automotive industry with Roadmap E. By 2028, we would like to be a 
world leader for e-mobility and in this context want to launch close 
to 70 new electrified models around the world and sell 22 million 
electric vehicles by then. The proportion of the fleet that is electric 
should rise to more than 20% by 2025 and to at least 40% by 2030. 
In 2019, the first electric vehicles of the new generation went into 
production: the Audi e-tron, the Porsche Taycan and the Volkswagen 
ID.3. The first wave will also include the ID. CROZZ, the SEAT el-born, 
the ŠKODA VISION E, the ID. BUZZ and the ID. VIZZION.
Introduction > Decarbonization
For all drive technologies, the use of alternative fuels along with 
the use of green electricity is the most important CO2 reduction 
measure. The use of “reduced-carbon” fuels is already possible 
across all brands, as their suitability for use in internal combustion 
engines has been proven on numerous occasions.
CLIMATE PROTECTION IN MANUFACTURING
By 2025, the CO2 emissions of all plants per vehicle is to be reduced 
by 50% compared to 2010. As part of our contribution to the Paris 
Agreement, we are also introducing absolute CO2 targets at the 
same time.
The key to this is increasing energy efficiency and raising the pro-
portion of renewable energies in our electricity supply. Globally, 
the proportion of renewable energies in the Volkswagen Group is 
41% of electricity consumption. 100% of electricity is already ob-
tained from renewable energy at 43 Group sites. We are also 
strengthening our approach with a new sourcing strategy that pro-
vides for the undifferentiated sourcing of energy for all new con-
tracts only with corresponding proof of origin (Energy Attribute 
Certificates) where the particular electricity market offers this 
option.
The conversion of the power plants in Wolfsburg from coal to gas 
was begun in the reporting year and is expected to bring an annual 
saving of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 from 2023, which is equivalent 
to 60%. A 33% increase in the energy efficiency of combined cycle 
gas turbine power plants and the use of natural gas instead of coal 
is intended to decrease the CO2 emissions of the two power plants. 
The modernization means the CO2 emissions of the Group's pro-
duction facilities reduce by 15%.
The Volkswagen Group proportionally funds projects that make a 
contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with an inter-
nal CO2 fund. €25 million per year is currently available for this. 
Most of the electricity for the Volkswagen Group’s German produc-
tion sites that is not produced by the Group itself is carbon-neutral 
Volkswagen Naturstrom® electricity, i.e. renewable energy. Approv-
al for building and operating certified wind power facilities pro-
ducing 12.8 MW at the MAN Salzgitter site was granted in 2017 as 
part of a public procedure. The project was confirmed in the Federal 
Network Agency’s EEG Tendering Process 2018. The four wind tur-
bines were ordered from the manufacturer. The commissioning of 
the plant began at the end of 2019.
CARBON-NEUTRAL PLANTS
Audi’s manufacturing in Brussels has had a carbon-neutral foot-
print since 2018. The Zwickau site will also be operated with a car-
bon-neutral footprint. The energy for the production of the ID.3, 
which started at the site in 2019, is covered exclusively by our own 
highly efficient cogeneration via combined heat and power plants 
and Volkswagen Naturstrom®. CO2 emissions have been reduced by 
90,000 tonnes per year solely through the use of green energy. Effi-
ciency measures in production include, for example, optimized 
thermal afterburning in the paint line, frequency-controlled fans 
and the use of energy-efficient air compressors. The remaining 
emissions from ID.3 production will initially be offset through cli-
mate protection projects, although the intention is to gradually re-
duce this. In addition, agreements are being entered into with sup-
pliers so that customers who purchase an ID.3 will receive a vehicle 
which is produced with a completely carbon-neutral footprint 
throughout the supply and production chain. The Taycan model 
has also been manufactured in a carbon-neutral way and from 
100% renewable energy at the Porsche site at Zuffenhausen since 
the end of 2019. The sourcing of Volkswagen Naturstrom® has been 
supplemented by two additional combined heat and power plants 
with a capacity of around two megawatts since 2019. These are ex-
clusively run on biogas, which is obtained from biodegradable waste 
and residual materials. The site also uses biogas in the manufactur-
ing process. The Group’s head office and the main Bentley Motors 
plant in Crewe, England, received certification of their carbon neu-
trality in accordance with the PAS 2060 Carbon Neutrality Standard 
at the start of October. All of Bentley’s electrical power is either

These examples reflect our goal of manufacturing with a car-
bon-neutral footprint. We use correspondingly strict approval cri-
teria when selecting climate protection projects for offsetting hard-
to-avoid emissions: 
• Evidence of a continuous increase in energy efficiency 
• Submission of a feasibility study for complete avoidance of emis-
sions at the site 
• Complete cover of electrical power needs from renewable sources 
or highly efficient cogeneration 
• Twice the investments in ongoing efficiency improvement com-
pared to planned spending for offsetting 
We also take extensive climate protection measures in the area of 
IT infrastructure. For example, the Volkswagen Group moved into a 
new climate-neutral data center in Rjukan (Norway) in 2019. The 
plan is to power the data center entirely by hydro-power, saving 
more than 5,800 tonnes of CO2 per year compared to a convention-
ally operated data center. The maximum output of 2,750 kW will be 
used by the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi brands for 
high-performance servers, which are used for computer-intensive 
vehicle development projects. These include the simulation of 
crash tests and virtual wind tunnel tests.
 
 Introduction > Decarbonization
“GOTOZERO IMPACT LOGISTICS”
In order to contribute to achieving the “goTOzero” Group environ-
mental mission statement targets in logistics, Volkswagen Group 
Logistics is working together with colleagues from Brand Logistics 
in the goTozero Impact Logistics initiative. This builds on the previ-
ous Green Logistics initiative. Emissions are reduced through the 
continuous optimization of the production and transport network. 
In addition, the use of new, low-emission technologies in the trans-
portation of production materials and finished vehicles is being re-
viewed and pushed.
The measures taken by the Volkswagen Group for future car-
bon-neutral logistics comprise shifting transportation from road 
to rail and the carbon offsetting of rail transportation in Germany 
and Europe in collaboration with Deutsche Bahn AG. In addition, 
Volkswagen Group Logistics is putting into commission the world’s 
first roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ships powered by liquefied natural gas 
for vehicle transport across the North Atlantic and is committed to 
ensuring that transport companies operating for Volkswagen can 
use LNG trucks.
PARTICIPATING IN EMISSIONS TRADING
Thirty-two of our Group locations participate in European emis-
sions trading and thus comply with a legal requirement of the EU. 
For 2019, a total of 975,009 emissions certificates were allocated to 
the Volkswagen Group free of charge (110,235 fewer than in the pre-
vious year). The European Commission is already planning to make 
further changes to emissions trading when the fourth trading peri-
od begins (from 2021). These could lead to a tightening of the sys-
tem and thus to price increases for the certificates. In addition to 
the EU member states, other countries in which the Volkswagen 
Group has production sites are also considering introducing an 
emissions trading system. Seven corresponding pilot projects are 
running in China, for example, although they have not so far af-
fected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government officially 
implemented a national emissions trading system at the end of 
2017. Initially, the impact will only be on the energy generation sec-
tor; a gradual expansion is planned.

AIR QUALITY
E-MOBILITY FOR IMPROVING AIR QUALITY
Mobility adversely affects air quality worldwide, particularly in 
large cities. Nitrogen oxide emissions and particulate matter are 
primarily responsible for this. The political and legal environment 
is affected by the introduction of stricter limits – with correspond-
ingly detailed approval processes for new vehicles.
The Volkswagen Group gives retaining air quality a high priority 
and has established this action area as one of the four decisive pil-
lars in the environmental mission statement. The Group sees the 
broad expansion of electric mobility as a key step for improving lo-
cal air quality because electrically powered vehicles are emission-free 
on the road. By 2025, the share of battery electric vehicles in our 
model portfolio will be between 20% and 25%. The proportion of 
electric vehicles in our new passenger car fleet in Europe and China 
is to rise to at least 40% by 2030. For us, this proportion is therefore 
the key indicator of improved air quality that the Volkswagen 
Group can influence.
In accordance with the new Group environmental mission state-
ment, we have organizationally anchored the topic of air quality 
even more firmly in the Group’s environmental management: 
measures are managed by the Group Steering Committees for the 
Environment and Energy, CO2, Fleet Compliance and Exhaust Emis-
sions. In addition, a “Tires” working group was formed that checks, 
among other things, to what extent the higher weight of electric 
cars because of the battery has an impact on abraded particles from 
tires and particulate air pollution. At the same time, the diesel task 
force continues to work in Germany, which, among other things, 
coordinates follow-up measures from the results of the 2017 diesel 
summit. These measures also included trade-ins of scrap vehicles.
CHECKING AND COMPLYING WITH LIMITS
In internal combustion engines, we strictly adhere to national and 
international legal norms and limits. The Euro 6d-TEMP standard 
has been obligatory for new registrations here since September 1, 
2019. In addition to the use of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Ve-
hicles Test Procedure (WLTP), it also requires measurement in ac-
cordance with the RDE (= Real Driving Emissions) standard. Unlike 
with WLTP, emissions are not measured on a test bench – they are 
measured in actual road traffic. The tests are carried out by exter-
nal and independent test laboratories. Our vehicles approved since 
September 2019 meet the increased European requirements for 
complying with evaporation limits (evaporative emission limits). 
In vehicle manufacturing, evaporative emissions mean the evapo-
ration of hydrocarbon compounds of organic materials and fuel, 
which leave the vehicle through evaporation or penetration of per-
meable components.
Each of our diesel vehicles has an SCR catalytic converter as stan-
dard. We equip all the new TSFI Otto engines with particulate filters, 
thus complying with the legal obligation under the Euro-6 standard.
COOPERATION ON A LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
In Germany, we are continuing the dialog and collaboration with 
large cities that have discussed the problems of nitrogen oxide 
emissions and possibly banning diesel vehicles. In 2018, the Group 
supported broad studies and assessments of measures regarding 
air pollution control in four cities. The result was that alongside lo-
cal transport policy decisions, replacement of vehicle fleets with 
clean drive technologies is the most effective approach for better 
air quality. This collaboration with local government was also con-
tinued in 2019. Cities such as Kiel, Ludwigsburg, or Stuttgart have 
used the study findings to revise their air pollution control plans 
by adopting the measures identified as effective and feasible, in 
some cases directly.
We realize that air pollution in major cities and urban areas is a 
problem which is not confined to Germany. We are thus active on a 
global level, for example in the WBCSD project “Transforming Ur-
ban Mobility” which, together with other players, is searching for 
solutions for sustainable cities. In addition to climate protection, 
safety, efficiency and access, good air quality and fair use of space 
are among the core target areas of sustainable cities.
 
 Digital > Mobility Concepts
It is not just our investments in electric mobility and modern com-
bustion technologies that make a contribution to better air. We also 
take measures in this area in production and, for example, continu-
ously reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that 
arise from processes in our paint facilities. Among others, the Chi-
na region makes a significant contribution to the reduction of the 
average VOC emissions in the Group. In the period from 2010 to 
2019, the VOC emissions per vehicle decreased by more than 80% 
in the China region.

RESOURCES
CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES 
Human interference in ecosystems, pollution, damage and the use 
of finite natural resources through economic activity are reaching 
levels that make a rethink and a change of direction unavoidable. 
The production of vehicles also requires many natural raw materi-
als. That is why the conservation of resources along the entire life 
cycle of our products and mobility solutions is a central pillar of 
our “goTOzero” concept. In this context, we want to maximize re-
source efficiency, promote circular economy approaches and set 
ourselves measurable targets.
By 2025, we want to reduce energy and water consumption, waste 
for disposal (production-specific volumes only), and CO2 and VOC 
emissions in production by 45% for each vehicle produced – start-
ing from 2010 levels and throughout the whole Group. This target 
figure – the environmental impact reduction production per unit 
(UEP) – was defined as part of the production strategy and includes 
targets for the Group and its brands. Given their high environmen-
tal relevance, we focus particularly on energy and CO2.
One element of the production strategy is the zero impact factory 
initiative. This involves us working on four key issues in the period 
leading up to 2025:
• Setting and achieving ambitious environmental targets for 
production
• Developing a long-term vision for environmental targets in pro-
duction and rolling it out across the Group
• Strengthening employees' environmental awareness 
• Integration of relevant environmental aspects into processes
In the Group, we have made significant progress on our way to 
achieving our targets. The following charts show the development 
of these figures from 2010 to 2019 (data: 11+1 months).
• Specific energy requirements: –20.2%
• Specific CO2 emissions: –38.4%
• Specific VOC emissions: –59.3%
• Specific water consumption: –21.5%
• Specific waste for disposal (production-specific volumes 
only): –58.4%
The Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy 
and additional subject-specific Group steering committees are sub-
stantially responsible for implementing the results programs and 
monitoring target achievement. With the IT-supported “Massnah-
men@web” system, we record environmental measures and en-
courage the Group-wide exchange of best practices. In the report-
ing year, around 1,240 implemented measures in the area of 
environment and energy were documented in this system. They 
serve to improve infrastructure and production processes for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles.
Overall, the high quality focus with a low need for repair ensures 
our vehicles have long lives in the usage phase, thus making an im-
portant contribution to resource efficiency.
ZERO IMPACT FACTORY FUTURE STRATEGY
The Volkswagen Group is bundling its activities for greater resource 
efficiency in the future in the “goTOzero – zero impact factory” ini-
tiative, which targets production with no impact on the environ-
ment. An assessment system checks how far removed a factory is 
from zero impact on the environment. As well as the criteria of cli-
mate protection and energy, emissions, water and waste, this also 
includes aspects such as the appearance of the factory, commit-
ment to biodiversity, protecting the soil, avoidance of business dis-
ruptions, functioning environmental management, better re-
source efficiency towards a circular economy or environmentally 
neutral mobility management for employees and the transporta-
tion of goods.
The assessment has already been tested at eight Group sites 
(Zuffenhausen, Mladá Boleslav, Bratislava, Martorell, Brussels, 
Września, Emden and Leipzig) and is being continuously further 
rolled out in the Group, including at other Audi sites, at the 
Volkswagen brand’s sites and in China.
In 2019 the German Sustainable Building Council (Deutsche Ge-
sellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen – DGNB) gave the Porsche plant 
in Leipzig, which is currently being expanded for the future re-
quirements of electric mobility, the top grade of “platinum” . In ad-
dition to environmental protection, biodiversity and energy life cy-
cle assessments, the DGNB assessed the use of resources, the design 
of the site, city climate effects and infrastructure facilities, ecologi-
cal monitoring of construction work, life-cycle costs, value stability 
and the associated plans and processes. The DGNB rates the life cy-
cle assessment of energy management and the adaptability of the 
site as particularly good.
USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS
We are stepping up efforts to use material loops in our production 
processes. When selecting raw materials, we opt for recycled ones 
obtained from production waste or end-of-life products. When de-
veloping new vehicles, we pay attention to the recyclability of the 
required materials, use high-quality recycled material and avoid 
pollutants. According to the european Directive on End-of-Life Ve-
hicles, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles must be 85% 
recyclable and 95% recoverable at the end of their lives – our vehi-
cles registered in Europe meet this legal requirement.
In order to calculate how much of a complete vehicle is recycled, we 
determine the materials for all relevant components in the vehicle 
and their recycled materials content and add these together. Relia-
ble information straight from suppliers and sector-specific associa-
tion data are essential for this.
GRI 302-1, 302-4, 306-2

The Aluminum Closed Loop Project, which for the first time 
achieved a closed loop for aluminum beyond Company boundaries 
in 2017, is an example of our approach. For instance, at the Neckars-
ulm site Audi uses the recycling concept in which the waste from 
aluminum sheet-metal parts from the press shop is delivered di-
rectly back to the suppliers. The supplier can recycle the scrap and 
use it to produce new material that Audi then uses again in the 
press shop. In this way, Audi not only saves energy and avoids CO2 
emissions, but also reduces the quantity of primary raw materials 
needed. In addition, the quality of the recyclate remains at the 
highest level and downcycling is avoided. This process has already 
avoided more than 150,000 tonnes of CO2 since the start in 2017. 
Audi is currently testing rollout to all aluminum-processing press 
shops in the Group. If this closed-loop process is also implemented 
in full at the Ingolstadt, Győr and Bratislava sites, several hundred 
thousand tonnes of CO2 emissions could be saved per year. The pro-
cedure has already received a sustainability certificate (Perfor-
mance Standard) from the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative. With 
lithium-ion batteries too, we ensure not only the longest service 
life possible but also the use of materials from a closed loop. Anoth-
er example is the pilot facility for recycling batteries being set up at 
the Salzgitter site, which is to be put into operation in 2020.
USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
GRI 306-2
In order to reduce our resource consumption, we rely on environ-
mentally friendly raw materials from renewable and nonrenewable 
sources when manufacturing our vehicles. Wherever possible, 
our Group brands use renewable raw materials such as the natural 
fibers flax, cotton, wood and cellulose. Such materials can be used if 
they comply with all the technical requirements and perform better 
than conventional materials over the life cycle. In addition, our strict 
sustainability standards naturally apply for our suppliers.
We take advantage of new opportunities in body construction where 
we improve existing products or design new ones in the interests of 
functionality, quality, safety and environmental compatibility. Intel-
ligent lightweight construction is the guiding principle here. For vol-
ume models, we use hot-formed, high-strength steel. Although ener-
gy consumption in production is higher, the lighter vehicle body 
allows a reduction in CO2 emissions and thus an improvement in the 
overall environmental impact of the product.
RESPONSIBLE USE OF WATER
The supply chain, in particular obtaining and processing raw mate-
rials, is responsible for most of our water use. Because we cannot 
influence these aspects directly, we concentrate on our production 
sites. Of all fresh water that we use, 55% (around 21 million m³) is 
used by sites in risk zones, i.e. regions with water shortages, such as 
Mexico. The concept for sustainable water management approved  
 
 
by the Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy 
takes into account this aspect and defines four areas of activity:
• The safe supply and disposal of water by protecting groundwater 
reserves against pollution
• Efficient water use through closed loops over the life cycle
• Social and ecological work through projects to protect water re-
serves and raise public awareness of environmental issues 
• Transparency through supporting the CDP Water Disclosure 
Project (WDP)
We manage water-saving processes at our Group’s locations during 
production in line with Group-wide specifications. In 2019, we were 
given an A for our sustainable water management in the WDP rank-
ing. Given our growing production figures and the integration of 
new sites, our Group’s absolute fresh water use has increased in re-
cent years. The amount of freshwater used per vehicle fell by 21.5% 
per vehicle from 2010 to 2019 – thanks to a range of recycling meas-
ures and the introduction of manufacturing processes requiring 
little water.
The amount of waste water produced is in line with the amount of 
fresh water that we use. Differences in quantities between fresh and 
waste water are the result of evaporation in cooling towers and dur-
ing the manufacturing process.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND SAFE WASTE MANAGEMENT
Our waste strategy aims to reduce the quantity of waste per unit 
produced and to reuse unavoidable waste to create high-quality 
materials. The focus is on:
• Avoiding waste creation by optimizing production and auxiliary 
processes and increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency)
• Reducing the quantity of waste produced by processing waste at 
sites
• Prioritizing the reuse of waste and reducing the quantity of 
waste that needs to be disposed of
In order to optimize our management of waste, we are increasingly 
using digital waste management systems in all German and a num-
ber of European plants of the brands Volkswagen, Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, Audi and MAN. They make it easier 
to control waste management processes and facilitate state control 
of the disposal of hazardous waste (electronic government).
In order to monitor waste management and recycling processes, we 
carry out regular cross-site, cross-brand and cross-OEM waste dis-
posal audits in Germany and the rest of Europe. In addition, the au-
ditors receive further training and hold regular discussions to ensure 
that they have a common understanding of the quality requirements 
associated with waste disposal services, to carry out audits of con-
sistently high quality and to allow other OEMs and suppliers to take 
advantage of the results.
67
T H E  E N V I R O N M E N T
We reuse waste from manufacturing, logistics, workshops and 
technical development to produce high-quality materials. Our Pro-
curement Division has established a reliable Group-wide system for 
recovering waste materials which can generate income, for exam-
ple paper, plastics, wood, or metal.
Under the umbrella of the zero impact factory initiative, we are in-
tensifying our efforts to avoid plastic waste with the Zero Plastic 
Waste Factory project. Analyses at the Hanover and Pamplona sites 
have revealed considerable potential for action to achieve waste 
avoidance and cost savings. At the Hanover site, a plastic recycling 
center has been established as part of the project. Meanwhile, waste 
collection initiatives were undertaken at Porsche and the Poznan 
site and a mobile plastic collecting basin has been installed in the 
port of Brussels under the sponsorship of Audi Environmental 
Foundation. A joint approach is currently being developed with the 
Group brands in order to systematically entrench the topic of plas-
tic avoidance in the long term.
PERMANENT REDUCTION OF VOC EMISSIONS
Painting processes are the main cause of VOC emissions. In mod-
ern paint facilities, paints and process materials containing low 
levels of solvents are used. We take suitable steps to intercept or 
eliminate emitted solvents. In order to do this, we mainly use ther-
mal afterburning of outgoing air, which is downstream of the actu-
al painting process. In spite of an increase in vehicle production 
and the resulting increase in the amount of painting carried out 
since 2010, we have reduced our absolute VOC emissions by 37.0%. 
We have also significantly reduced the VOC emissions per vehicle 
(passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) by 59.3% since 2010.
ADDITIONAL TABLES AND KPIS
The following tables give an overview of the objectives for the focal 
topic of the environment.
We report selected environmental data as regards production with-
in the Volkswagen Group in the following tables of key indicators. 
The data is collected, checked and approved at our production sites 
in line with an internal standard (VW Standard 98 000). The values 
for December of the preceding year may include some estimated 
data if, for example, they are based on bills from power suppliers or 
waste disposal providers which were not yet available at the time of 
compilation. In the next data collection round, this estimated data 
will be replaced with the finalized figures for December. 
In accordance with our environmental strategy, the various time 
series portrayed here refer to the baseline year of 2010 and show 
comparisons to both the reporting year and the previous year. Over-
all, environmental data is collected from the Group’s production 
sites. Data in the “passenger cars and light commercial vehicles” 
category is reported for 2010, 2018 and 2019. Data for the brands 
Scania AB, MAN SE, Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. and VW Kraftwerk 
GmbH is reported in the “other divisions” category; the respective 
proportions are shown separately in the tables. Unless otherwise 
indicated, all the Group’s production sites, together with the power 
stations and boiler plants operated by Volkswagen AG in Wolfsburg, 
Kassel and Hanover in Germany, are included in both categories. 
The data covers 116 of the Group's 124 production sites. There is no 
data available for the eight production sites not covered. These cor-
respond to approximately 0.3% of the workforce at the production 
sites, and hence have no relevant influence on the Group’s KPIs.
The Volkswagen Group is essentially an automotive manufacturer 
which produces passenger cars and light commercial vehicles as 
well as heavy-duty commercial vehicles and buses. MAN SE does, 
however, also manufacture marine engines and power station 
components. In view of this product diversity, our overall environ-
mental impact cannot simply be expressed in terms of the volume 
of vehicles produced. Consequently, relative indicators are only 
shown for the “passenger cars and light commercial vehicles” 
category. 
The changing production volumes and associated fluctuations in 
capacity utilization levels at our various locations are reflected in 
changes in the absolute values of many indicators. However, in-
creased efficiency did result in improvements in the specific values 
of a number of indicators. Weather conditions have an appreciable 
but uncontrollable impact on the consumption of resources. This 
relates primarily to space heating demand for both production and 
nonproduction areas, since the annual average temperatures impact 
the direct consumption of energy sources as well as the amount of 
energy purchased from third parties.
The specific values are also influenced by a range of factors. On the 
one hand, absolute consumption or emissions levels may change, 
while on the other, rising or falling production volumes at the indi-
vidual production sites also influence the indicators.

FAIRNESS AND RESPONSIBILITY
The role of companies in society has become an increasing focus of 
public attention in recent years. Financial crises, ethical misconduct 
and adverse social and environmental impacts of products and ser-
vices have weakened trust in companies. Their future viability in-
creasingly depends on whether they are able to restore their credibil-
ity and the legitimacy of their business model through responsible, 
socially sustainable actions.
For the Volkswagen Group, this means not only strengthening in-
tegrity and compliance and minimizing the environmental impact 
of its own manufacturing and products, but offering its employees 
good and fair working conditions and actively creating social add-
ed value as a mobility service provider of the future. We pursue a 
similar approach in the field of social sustainability. As a good cor-
porate citizen, we want to act responsibly and fairly here towards 
all stakeholders. Internally, the cornerstones of this are the traits of 
a good employer, such as employee participation, job security, de-
velopment opportunities and equal opportunities. Externally, we 
seek dialog with society, initiate and support social projects and en-
courage our employees to take responsibility for the community. 
This realignment should build on the Group’s existing foundations, 
but also produce new things.
The Volkswagen Group’s HR division and its Works Council in par-
ticular have for years been committed to the aim of strengthening 
the Group’s contribution to society and strengthening the percep-
tion of Volkswagen as a responsible company and a socially respon-
sible employer.
RESPONSIBILITY AS AN EMPLOYER
The Volkswagen Group is further advancing the transformation of 
the automotive industry towards climate-friendly e-mobility and 
digitally connected driving. We will only make a success of this 
change if we involve our employees, train them and prepare them 
for the forthcoming changes in the best way possible, as the success 
of our Group depends more than ever on the skills and commitment 
of our employees and on our attractiveness as an employer.
We employ more than 670,000 people, of which around one sixth 
are women. For every employee, we aim for an employment rela-
tionship that is characterized by fair and transparent pay, good de-
velopment opportunities, participation and involvement in the 
work process and a high level of job security. We work in 36 countries 
in Europe and 38 countries in the Americas, Asia and Africa and op-
erate 124 production facilities around the world. In all theses places, 
we assume a major responsibility for the employees, their families, 
but also for social and economic development around our sites. 
In many of our companies, we have guaranteed the existence of 
jobs through collective bargaining agreements. At Volkswagen AG 
in Germany, job security previously applied until 2019 and has been 
extended until 2029 through the Digitalization Roadmap. In order 
to successfully overcome the challenges of the digital transformation, 
the Group communicates with employee representatives on future 
agreements that both position the Group’s individual brands more 
efficiently and strengthen employees’ career prospects. Examples 
of these are the Volkswagen brand’s roadmap for digital transfor-
mation and the Audi brand’s Audi.Zukunft agreement, both of 
which were announced in fiscal year 2019.
By 2023, and possibly beyond it, the Volkswagen brand in Germany 
wants to invest up to €4 billion in major digitalization projects 
within this framework and wants to make the administrative areas 
significantly more efficient as a result. To this end, approximately 
4,000 jobs will be lost along the demographic curve. At the same 
time, the working environment will be made more attractive by 
targeted investments in new software generations. By 2023, around 
2,000 digital experts will be recruited and the training budget will 
be centralized and increased to €160 million. 
Agreements such as the Digital Transformation Roadmap provide 
the right answers to various challenges at a national or internation-
al level from an HR perspective. For example, Germany and other 
parts of Western Europe face not only risks resulting from demo-
graphic changes but continue to face shortages of skilled workers who 
we will need for IT and digitalization in the future. We are actively 
combating these problems through extensive recruitment measures, 
innovative employer branding campaigns and a training drive.
We regard the diversity of our employees with their broad range of 
experience, viewpoints and problem-solving ideas as a pillar of our 
future viability and as something that ought to be encouraged fur-
ther. To this end we are in the process of raising all managers’ aware-
ness with the Diversity Wins@Volkswagen program currently be-
ing implemented across the Group, and deliberately expanding 
approaches for promoting diversity.
We have anchored our role as an excellent employer as one of four 
target dimensions in our Together 2025+ Group strategy. It high-
lights the importance of skilled and dedicated employees. We aim 
to increase their satisfaction and motivation by means of equal op-
portunities, an attractive and modern working environment, and a 
forward-looking organization of work. The basis for this is an open, 
positive and partnership-based culture, a high level of diversity in 
the workforce and exemplary and inspiring leadership. These ele-
ments help us to retain employees at Volkswagen and attract the 
best talent worldwide in order to work together on fully connected 
and sustainable mobility. 
We want to be measured by concrete progress with regard to reach-
ing our strategic objectives in the HR division. We have defined key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to this end: for internal employer at-
tractiveness we conduct annual employee surveys and measure 
satisfaction using our Opinion Survey.  For the assessment of exter-
nal employer attractiveness, we make use of surveys and rankings 
by renowned institutions. The diversity index is the key perfor-
mance indicator for us regarding increasing the proportion of 
women in management and the level of internationalization in top 
management.

Alongside the implementation of the Group strategy, the “Excellent 
Leadership” module defined a work package that drives the transi-
tion to an even more cooperative management culture with even 
greater integrity under the motto of “diversity, integrity, strong 
leadership”. We are radically reorganizing our management devel-
opment and training to this end. We are systematizing succession 
planning in order to have the right talent in the right positions at 
the right time in the Group. We want to significantly increase the 
diversity in our management. 
The common goal:  by 2025, the Volkswagen Group will set an ex-
ample for others with an open, partnership-based and value-based 
culture of collaboration.
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT AS A DRIVER OF EMPLOYMENT 
POLICY
A responsible HR policy that is geared to the needs of employees re-
quires a powerful HR organization guided by quality goals. In the 
course of 2018 and 2019, we radically restructured Volkswagen AG’s 
HR in order to increase the efficiency of HR work and customer focus.
The goals are the bundling of processes, flatter organizational struc-
tures, an improvement of customer care quality, clear responsibility 
and higher capacity for strategic topics and innovative HR products. 
Separate Group control units for the areas of HR principles and 
management, HR strategy and innovation, and diversity and the 
advancement of women were formed under the member of the 
Board of Management for HR. In addition, a unified model was de-
veloped for HR organization in the plants.
This modernization, which initially concentrates on Volkswagen AG, 
introduces the Group-wide transformation of human resources 
work. “One HR” will in the future create global standards for brands 
and companies and a common and consistent operating model for 
the Volkswagen Group’s HR division. “One HR” will in the future 
serve as a Group-wide blueprint for the strategic and organizational 
direction of the Group’s HR work.
We are guided by clear values here. The Volkswagen Group Essen-
tials set out the common basic values for all brands and companies 
within the Group. Seven simple “We” statements describe what the 
Group stands for: “We take on responsibility for the environment 
and society”, “We are honest and speak up when something is wrong”, 
“We break new ground”, “We live diversity”, “We are proud of the 
work we do”, “We not me”, “We keep our word”. 
We adhere strictly to the relevant national legal standards when 
dealing with all matters that affect our personnel. However, in line 
with our tradition of social partnership and the balancing of inter-
ests, we go beyond these standards: we want to allow all our em-
ployees throughout the world to share in Volkswagen’s social achieve-
ments and its high work and social standards.
Participation, initiative and individual creative opportunities are 
particularly important when it comes to keeping our promises as 
an employer. We would like our employees to be responsible, com-
petent and confident “Company citizens” who actively take part in 
company affairs and get involved in decision-making processes. 
For even better internal communication, we launched a digital ser-
vice for employees in the form of the 360° Volkswagen app as a pi-
lot project at Volkswagen AG in 2019. It should also be established 
internationally from 2020 onward. Its functions include news from 
various channels on the brands and sites and also services for the 
organization of day-to-day work. Moreover, there is also publicly 
accessible information for prospective employees and people inter-
ested in the Group, for example on the topic of mobility and career.

P E O P L E
EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS
OUR GOAL OF BEING AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE
Our central goal is to be an attractive and reliable employer. For us, 
this primarily means keeping all the promises that we made to our 
employees and making our employees aware of this in their day-to-
day work. Given that talented potential employees are becoming 
increasingly scarce, a high degree of credibility is another key re-
quirement if the Group is to be perceived as a top employer and is 
to attract and keep the best employees. In order to fill jobs in cut-
ting-edge fields with experienced and creative IT and digitalization 
experts, we are intensifying our efforts with the creation of a new 
recruitment unit. The Recruitment & Talent Marketing team sup-
ports Volkswagen AG’s departments in the entire recruitment pro-
cess. We are primarily looking for new employees who will actively 
help to shape the future of mobility and want to advance social 
change in this way.  The “Recruiting@Volkswagen: Hello Possible” 
campaign is particularly aimed at IT and digital experts. With meas-
ures such as these, we also attract young talented employees to us, 
who in addition to monetary incentives are looking for a higher 
purpose in their work for a successful employment relationship. 
OPINION SURVEY MEASURES EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION
We attach great importance to actively involving our employees in 
processes and to ensuring that their opinions, assessments and 
criticism are heard. With our Opinion Survey, an employee survey 
in 180 companies of the Group, we measure the satisfaction of our 
employees and thus the status of our internal employer attractive-
ness. In addition, we are also interested in our employees’ views on 
the questions of where the Group stands on the topic of integrity 
and how they assess working relationships in the Group. The re-
sults of the Opinion Survey serve to identify possible improvements 
and inform managers of where action needs to be taken in their or-
ganizational units. In defined follow-up processes, managers take 
suitable measures in dialog with their employees and are support-
ed in doing this by the Opinion Survey Group team, which provides 
various tools for this – such as a method toolbox.
In addition, a new, compulsory top-down approach has been devel-
oped, which is being used for the first time in the discussions of re-
sults in January to March 2020. For the regular managers’ measures 
discussion, a discussion of the measures derived and their imple-
mentation status will take place with a top-down approach, begin-
ning with the respective division manager/board member and pro-
ceeding to the lowest management level. The aim is to ensure the 
implementation of the measures derived from the organizational 
units in a lasting manner.
The 2019 Opinion Survey was carried out at 180 companies in 
50 countries. Approximately 500,000 of over 620,000 employees in 
the participating Group units responded; this is equivalent to a re-
sponse rate of 81%. In 2019, the score on the employee satisfaction 
index – a principal indicator generated by the Opinion Survey – was 
80.0 out of 100 possible index points and thus slightly above the 
score in the previous year (2018: 78.9 index points).
REMUNERATION IN LINE WITH PERFORMANCE AND GEARED TO 
SUCCESS
Fair, transparent pay that enables a good life is the prerequisite for 
satisfied employees. In accordance with our global Social Charter, 
the remuneration and fringe benefits for our employees correspond 
at least to the legally required minimum level which is to be guar-
anteed in the particular country. This not only applies to our own 
workforce, but to all our suppliers’ employees as well. As they are 
collectively agreed with trade unions, our rates of pay are usually 
considerably higher than the prevailing minimum levels.
When setting individual pay rates, we make no distinction between 
people of different genders or belonging to other groups: our em-
ployees are selected, appointed and nurtured exclusively on the ba-
sis of their qualifications and abilities.
Remuneration is based strictly on the job performed and individu-
al performance. 
Employees of Group companies enjoy further Company benefits. 
Depending on location, these may include subsidized transport 
and meals, low-cost accommodation, monthly childcare allowances 
and discounts on certain leisure activities. Additional healthcare or 
supplementary pension benefits round off the range of company 
benefits at specific sites. By offering occupational pension schemes, 
Volkswagen AG, its brands and subsidiaries make an important 
contribution towards securing their employees’ income in old age.
CREATING A WORK/LIFE BALANCE 
We are constantly working on improving our employees work/life 
balance through flexible working time models. For example, we 
would like to take into account the specific needs of new parents, 
single parents or employees who are also carers. The rules and pro-
grams here vary from country to country and are determined by 
the legal framework and the results of collective negotiations with 
trade unions.
In Germany, the large number of people who take advantage of 
their legally governed parental leave entitlement proves how many 
employees wish for reconcilability of work and family life. In our 
Company regulations too, we endeavor to take into account the fact 
that many employees need greater flexibility as regards their work-
ing hours and place of work. Since 2016, a far-reaching Company 
agreement for working outside Company premises (mobile work-
ing) has been in place. Group brands such as Audi and Porsche have 
similar arrangements.
Our re-employment guarantee offers a very high level of flexibility. 
For the past 20 years or so, Volkswagen AG employees have been 
able to take up to eight years’ leave of absence without having to 
give a reason. Regardless of whether this leave is used for a sabbati-
cal, for parental leave or for career development purposes, employ-
ees have a guaranteed right to re-employment on the same terms 
and conditions as before.
GRI 102-36, 102-41, 402-1
78
We also help our employees to care for and look after close rela-
tives. Employees can take up to ten days’ leave at short notice in or-
der to organize care for sick relatives, for instance. Employees can 
take up to six months’ leave or reduce their working hours for the 
same period in order to care for a relative. Employees can work 
part-time for up to 24 months in order to care for their families.
We also consider organized childcare during working hours highly 
important for our employees’ work/life balance. The Volkswagen 
Group in Germany and abroad therefore endeavors to offer childcare 
geared to specific groups of people. In addition to the existing facil-
ities, a number of daycare centers near our operating locations have 
been set up in recent years. All German sites of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
and MAN brands offer childcare during school holidays.
With these measures, we are helping not only to meet the expecta-
tions of a modern working environment geared to human needs, 
but also to provide answers to many of the most urgent questions 
of the current transformation.
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION AND CODETERMINATION 
GRI 102-41
We include our employees in strategic decisions as early as possible 
in order to extensively inform our workforce about imminent 
changes and in many cases also to seek common solutions. When 
establishing cooperative labor relations marked by social harmony, 
we are guided by universally valid human rights and the standards 
of the International Labour Organization (ILO). 
On this basis, we have agreed various charters and declarations 
with our Group European Works Council (GEWC) and Global Group 
Works Council (GGWC) that safeguard the collective rights of our 
employees in the workplace and set out basic work policy principles 
of the Volkswagen Group. We implement them rigorously through-
out the Group together with the codetermination committees or 
the employee representatives at the relevant sites. They include:
• The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen (Social Charter), which is geared to the relevant ILO 
conventions
• The Charter on Labor Relations, which sets out additional infor-
mation, consultation and codetermination rights for employee 
representatives of the brands, companies and locations repre-
sented by the Group European Works Council and the Global 
Group Works Council
• The Charter on Temporary Work, in which Group management as 
well as the Group European Works Council and the Global Group 
Works Council have agreed on principles relating to temporary 
work, for example guide values for the ratio of temporary to per-
manent employees, equal pay (for equal work), training meas-
ures and the limitation of employment periods with a subse-
quent review as to whether to take on the employee permanently
• The Charter on Vocational Education and Training, in which pro-
fessional training is established as a central part of labor relations. 
According to this charter, key aspects of training and the selection 
process, the duration and quality of professional training and the 
taking on of employees permanently are to be set out as part of 
the local implementation process for all sites.
In addition, there are a number of country and site-specific agree-
ments that stipulate, for example, standards for further training or 
preventive healthcare measures. These policy foundations underpin 
the rights of employees and their elected representatives at Group 
level in the European and Global Works Councils. Executive manag-
ers and employee representatives meet regularly to consult on rele-
vant issues. All members of the Group European Works Council and 
the Global Group Works Council attend at least one joint session of 
the two works councils every year. As well as discussing the current 
situation at the various sites, the respective HR managers and 
Group executive management also share information about prod-
uct and workforce plans as well as social welfare and personnel 
standards.
We want to enable the most comprehensive representation of em-
ployee interests possible in our Group. There is a high level of trade 
union organization in our Group and the German model of code-
termination is also practiced outside of Germany. For example, at 
many sites employees are represented in two ways: firstly, by a 
trade union, and secondly, by representatives elected to a works 
council at many sites. Many companies in the Group have a super-
visory board on which the workforce is represented. The Charter on 
Labor Relations allows employee representatives around the world 
to conclude agreements with local management on specific rights 
to information, consultation and codetermination.
In committees made up of equal numbers of employee and employ-
er representatives, both sides receive all relevant information at the 
same time. This far-reaching form of participation has proved high-
ly successful over many decades. It ensures that change processes 
are approached together and are supported by the entire workforce. 
Through their creativity, their knowledge and their initiative, em-
ployees take on responsibility for improving processes and prod-
ucts and ultimately help us to achieve our sustainability goals. In 
2019, more than 25,000 ideas were submitted as part of idea man-
agement, resulting in savings of approximately €31 million for the 
Group at the German sites of Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Sachsen 
GmbH and Volkswagen Osnabrück GmbH.

QUALIFICATION
TRAINING FOR THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND 
CULTURAL CHANGE 
As an employer, we want our employees to be able to work creating 
value at workplaces in our Group for their entire working lives. This 
requires not just for them to retain their health, but also adjusting 
skills and capabilities to the quickly changing environment. This is 
why training our employees is a top topic in our HR strategy.
The comprehensive specialist qualifications of our employees re-
main the basis for the highest technological excellence. The electri-
fication of the vehicle fleet, the transition towards connected, au-
tonomous driving and the digital transformation of our Group 
mean, however, that employees already need very different qualifi-
cations today. We are well prepared for these changes with our 
highly differentiated vocational and advanced training system 
with its tailored training measures. At Volkswagen, the possibility 
of making a contribution through qualifications and developing 
new skills in each career phase is also an important part of our 
promise as an employer.
DUAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING LAYS THE FOUNDATION
The majority of our employees in production are skilled workers 
with excellent qualifications. The conditions for this are created in 
particular by the dual vocational training in the Volkswagen Group. 
With its flexible combination of practical activities and theoretical 
knowledge, vocational training prepares our young professionals 
as well as possible for the forthcoming challenges. Dual vocational 
training is at the heart of our activities Group-wide and is the best 
way for our junior employees to acquire the qualifications they 
need. On an international level, we implement the high German 
training standards but also comply with the relevant national 
standards and regulations.
In 2019, the Volkswagen Group was training 19,399 young people. 
We also support the career development of new entrants once they 
have completed their apprenticeship. For example, particularly tal-
ented young specialists are nurtured in talent groups. In the report-
ing year, 103 skilled workers joined this development and qualifica-
tion program. Through the “Wanderjahre” (year abroad) program, 
fully qualified vocational trainees also have the opportunity to 
move to an international Group company for 12 months. During 
the reporting year, 33 Volkswagen Group sites in 16 countries took 
part in this development program with a total of 79 young people. In 
2019, 70 participants from Germany plus nine from other countries 
began their year abroad within the Volkswagen Group in Germany.
TRAINING SKILLED WORKERS AND MANAGERS
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, which is responsible for voca-
tional and advanced training, skilled workers can choose from a 
broad range of advanced training courses. These range from fur-
ther training on topics of the future and occupational or cross-dis-
ciplinary areas of general interest to specific qualifications in voca-
tional groups and even comprehensive personnel development 
programs. The training offering is being continuously extended. In 
2019, the Volkswagen Group Academy began its first collaborations 
with renowned external online training portals. For example, on the 
topic of IT, the video courses from the Pluralsight learning platform 
are now available to employees. Overall, around 118,000 training 
courses totaling 16.3 million hours of training were completed 
across the Group in 2019. We are preparing our managers for the 
challenges of the current transformation phase through targeted 
programs. In 2019, we created a new and high-quality training for-
mat in the form of the Senior Management Program. To this end, 
we are cooperating with the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) in Pots-
dam and the École des hautes études commerciales de Paris (HEC). 
In 2020, for members of upper and top management in Germany 
we are planning the Transform Leadership 2025+ program with a 
focus on “leadership in the transformation”. We want to cooperate 
with the energy factory St. Gallen, the University of St. Gallen’s con-
sultancy spin-off and Kienbaum Consultants International here. The 
majority of our development programs and selection procedures 
for executives, foremen and managers are standardized through-
out the Group. In the reporting year, Volkswagen provided around 
645 training courses and assessment centers for executives, fore-
men and managers in eight countries. 
As part of the Volkswagen Group Academy, the AutoUni provides 
knowledge relevant to the future with a focus on digitalization to 
the Group by engaging external and in-house senior experts in ad-
dition to universities. In the future, the AutoUni will focus its activ-
ities entirely on digitalization and IT topics. The focus of their con-
tent is digitalization and its challenges for the transformation. In 
the reporting year, there were more than 600 national and interna-
tional partnerships with universities, technical colleges and research 
institutions. Around 5,100 people took part in more than 90 AutoUni 
events all over the world in 2019.
INVESTMENT IN ACQUIRING SKILLS FOR E-MOBILITY AND 
DIGITALIZATION
In the current upheaval of the automotive industry, the Volkswagen 
Group’s particular focus in education is on training employees on 
important future technologies and closely supporting them in the 
transformation process. For example, the Group implemented a 
comprehensive qualification program for around 3,500 employees 
for a stable and successful ramp-up of the new electric models at 
the pilot site for e-mobility in Zwickau. In addition, more than 
1,600 employees have passed through the e-mobility training 
center and completed its full-day training courses. In the special 
high-voltage trainings, the focus was mainly on dealing with mod-
ern battery systems and power lines. Using modern learning ele-
ments, such as gamification and virtual reality, participants were 
able to acquire basic skills for the use of the new high-voltage as-
sembly groups and special product and process knowledge. A total 
of 8,000 employees were included in the change processes locally 
and prepared for the change in their work.
GRI 404-1, 404-2

Audi also focuses on training for electric mobility at its sites, for ex-
ample in the training for automotive mechatronics engineers. In 
this context, more than 300 trainees passed through high-voltage 
trainings in 2019 and acquired digital skills through hybrid learn-
ing concepts, including with the use of smart glasses. 
Through the measures, we gained extensive knowledge about which 
trainings are necessary for the transformation and how employees 
can be optimally trained for their new work. The Group will dis-
seminate this knowhow through its academies network to all sites 
around the world that are included in the transformation, for ex-
ample Chinese sites that are also preparing for the production of 
electric vehicles.
By 2023, Volkswagen AG wants to create at least 2,000 new jobs con-
nected to digitalization at its traditional West German sites. For the 
HR transformation in the course of the digitalization drive, the 
Group is increasing its training budget relating to new technologies 
by €60 million to a total of around €160 million. In addition, an on-
line university will be set up, learning will be strengthened via 
online platforms, and vocational and advanced training will be 
adapted to new requirements. This includes, for example, the Facul-
ty 73 program with which we broaden the knowledge basis for the 
digital transformation in the Group. Here, we began training soft-
ware developers ourselves for our own needs in spring 2019. In the 
future, 100 participants per academic year will complete the pro-
gram. The AutoUni’s two-year training program is designed for em-
ployees and in-house and external candidates with an affinity for 
IT. In this way, we open up highly attractive career advancement 
opportunities to undiscovered talents. More than 1,500 people ap-
plied for the program in 2019. The future experts acquire all the 
necessary skills for a successful career as a software developer in 
the automotive industry within the training. This includes, for ex-
ample, programming in Java, mathematics for software developers, 
technical and theoretical computer science, expertise in computer 
networks, databases and mobile app programming. Volkswagen 
plans to transfer the participants of the first academic year to the per-
manent workforce at the start of 2021 following intensive training.
DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
A strong management team and the right values are the prerequi-
sites for success in tomorrow’s world of mobility. Diversity, respect, 
tolerance and equal opportunities are decisive factors here. Talented 
people of any age and gender ensure the future of our Group with 
their various backgrounds, skills and experiences. 
The Volkswagen Group recognized this early on. The declaration 
“We live diversity” as one of the seven Group Essentials is thus an 
essential part of the Volkswagen Group’s DNA. The importance of 
equal opportunities and a high level of diversity in the workforce is 
also firmly anchored in the Together 2025+ Group strategy. The 
goal: to bundle the potential of all the employees of different 
brands, countries and subsidiaries with their skills, perspectives 
and experience within the Group, to bring together the best talent 
and ideas and in this way to shape the future of the automotive in-
dustry together. This sort of corporate culture increases employee 
motivation and performance and also customer satisfaction. This 
is because we are most likely to achieve customer satisfaction if all 
employees work creatively on innovative solutions with their dif-
ferent experience and perspectives. To this end, we need an open, 
positive and partnership-based working atmosphere in which em-
ployees can make a contribution and work together with enthusi-
asm. This enables us to attract brilliant minds to our Group and re-
tain them in the long term. 
The key to this is the pursuit of a holistic diversity management 
approach: we manage the establishment of processes geared to 
equal opportunities and also set and pursue targets for systematic 
measurement of the effectiveness of our programs and measures. 
In addition, we raise the workforce’s awareness, train our employees 
and use best practice examples and role models within the Group. 
This approach is intended to sustainably promote diversity and 
equality of opportunity in our Group.
EXCLUDING DISCRIMINATION AND BIAS
We exhibit a clear position: we stand for respect, for equal opportu-
nities, for working together and for equal treatment of people, irre-
spective of their ethnic origin, skin color, gender, disability, ideolo-
gy, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, social background, or 
political beliefs, provided the latter are based on democratic princi-
ples and tolerance towards those who hold different views. The 
Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct provides guidance throughout 
the Group.
We also enforce these rules in day-to-day business: all employees 
and managers are responsible for ensuring that colleagues work to-
gether in partnership. They are obliged to report any breaches im-
mediately. If employees feel discriminated against, they can turn to 
trained experts for advice and support.
The culture change in the Group also has a direct influence on our 
organization of diversity issues. For example, the HR Compliance 
Group policy adopted in 2019 enshrines minimum standards for 
sustainably promoting and ensuring diversity and equal opportuni-
ties. They are largely based on the Group Essentials. It is compulsory 
for there to be at least one contact in each company for management 
and employees for the topic of diversity and equal opportunities. 
Emphasis is placed on the creation of Group-wide awareness of the 
importance and added value of the topic, which requires continuous 
GRI 405-1
81
P E O P L E
and credible communication and for management and managers 
to act as role models. In particular, a sustainable discussion of the 
topic of unconscious bias by all managers and personnel managers 
promotes the creation of a bias-free working environment and pro-
cesses geared to equal opportunities in accordance with the Group 
policy.
RAISING AWARENESS OF DIVERSITY
Alongside the further development of diversity management, the 
Group-wide implementation of the mandatory awareness-raising 
program “Diversity Wins @Volkswagen” was at the center of activi-
ties in 2019. Managers, including foremen and trainers, are to be 
equipped to recognize new perspectives and skills in their teams 
and as a result to promote working together in a more efficient and 
innovative way. They will be motivated to integrate inclusive con-
duct into day-to-day management through interactive exercises 
and the joint development of measures. The intention is to reduce 
the influence of unconscious bias and stereotypes in important de-
cision-making situations in the long term. The training will be 
adapted locally in the brands and companies in line with require-
ments and rolled out via a multiplier principle. A network of diver-
sity managers and selected employees from all divisions is respon-
sible for carrying out the trainings locally. The implementation is 
continuously tracked and evaluated via HR Compliance. 
The Volkswagen Group holds a diversity conference each year to 
strengthen the global diversity network. In 2019, the third diversity 
conference took place with 67 diversity managers from more than 
40 Volkswagen companies and brands and 23 countries at Porsche 
Holding in Salzburg. The exchange on best practices on more diver-
sity and equal opportunities in the working environment was at the 
heart of it. The participants discussed topics including psychological 
security for employees, future forms of collaboration and Group-
wide initiatives, such as the ongoing manager training “Diversity 
Wins @Volkswagen”.
NEW “WE DRIVE PROUD” NETWORK
The Group’s employees and diversity management founded the 
“We Drive Proud” LGBT* and friends network in 2019 with the sup-
port of Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management. The network not 
only represents the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans*, in-
tersex* and queer people, it first and foremost wants to help to 
shape cultural change in the Group. “We Drive Proud” sees itself as 
an open, Group-wide initiative that maintains dialog with existing 
networks, e.g. those at Audi or Porsche. The Volkswagen Group in-
tends to support the formation of employee networks even more 
strongly in the future and thus to promote personal initiative and 
the willingness to take on responsibility.
DIVERSITY INDEX AS STRATEGIC KPI
Our diversity approach centers around quotas for women in man-
agerial positions and targets for the internationality of our top 
management. These two figures are combined in our diversity in-
dex, which has been in force since January 1, 2017. The diversity 
index forms part of our HR strategy and applies throughout the 
Volkswagen Group with its active workforce. With this index, we 
manage measures and assess the extent to which they have been 
implemented. At 14.3% in 2019, the proportion of women in man-
agement was at the previous year’s level. We want to increase the 
proportion of women in management to 20.2% by 2025. We aim to 
increase the level of internationalization in top management, the 
uppermost of our three management tiers, to 25.0% by 2025. In the 
past fiscal year this was 18.4% (19.2%). These targets are decided by 
the Group’s Board of Management and are binding for the whole 
organization.
PURSUING GOALS FOR INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF WOM-
EN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GERMAN LAW
We have also formulated goals as regards the proportion of women 
in management for Volkswagen AG in accordance with German 
law. In line with Germany’s law on equal participation for women 
and men in executive positions, Volkswagen AG has set itself tar-
gets for increasing the proportion of women in management by the 
end of 2021: 13% on the first level of management and 16.9% on the 
second level within the active workforce. As of Tuesday, December 
31, 2019, the proportion of women in the active workforce at the 
first level of management was 11.4% and at the second level of 
management it was 16.4%. The Group’s Board of Management and 
Supervisory Board are regularly updated on the progress we are 
making towards these targets.
In the reporting year, the proportion of women in managerial roles 
as part of the overall workforce of our Group in Germany rose to 
9.7% in senior management and 13.7% in management generally 
(taking into consideration the whole Group retroactively from 
2018). The proportion of women in top management increased 
from 6.1% in 2018 to 7.4% in the reporting year (taking into consid-
eration the whole Group retroactively from 2018). The proportion 
of women in management across the Group in Germany (taking into 
consideration the whole Group retroactively from 2018) thus came 
to 12.1%, up from 11.5% the year before.

NURTURING FEMALE TALENT AND MANAGERS
In addition to meeting the statutory requirements for the propor-
tion of women in management in Germany, we want to increase 
the proportion of women in all areas of the Volkswagen Group and 
are paving the way for this at an early stage. In Germany, for in-
stance, we are specifically seeking to attract female talent, for ex-
ample by arranging special work experience and orientation days 
for young women. Our aim is to increase the proportion of female 
trainees in industrial and technical trades from 18.5% in 2019 to 
30% in 2020. By recruiting female academics, we also lay the foun-
dation for a higher proportion of female managers and pursue the 
goal of achieving a proportion of women of 30% when recruiting 
from university graduates.
In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group optimized its existing 
modular mentoring program (MMM) with a focus on Germany and 
adapted it to changing challenges. In the reporting year, the talent 
that was identified for the management development process was 
given the opportunity to attend modules from the modular men-
toring program. The focus is on the targeted empowerment of high 
potential women in a male-dominated environment. Our medium- 
term goal is to raise the awareness of all managers regarding equal 
opportunity in the advancement of female talent at all hierarchy 
levels. 
The program offers the departments support with achieving the 
targets regarding the proportion of women and providing female 
role models. We in part deliberately opened up the offering for men 
in order to gain them as supporters. The formats of the modular 
mentoring program include workshops, management seminars, 
dialog events and the establishment of the mentor-mentee tandem 
relationship.
In addition, Volkswagen offers the “Kompass” program specifically 
to support female talent with an aim for a career in management. 
In the reporting year, 60 high-potential women took part in this 
program. The program was further developed and is starting in the 
first quarter of 2020 as “Kompass 2.0”. The target group has been 
extended to women who are looking for empowerment on their 
way to management. The program addresses women from the 
brands and companies in the Group who are in the orientation 
phase in terms of management development. In the long term, the 
point of this program is also to increase the proportion of women 
in management. A networking day and a mentor-mentee tandem 
relationship stand at the heart of this program.
SUPPORTING INCLUSION AT THE WORKPLACE
Our understanding of diversity extends beyond gender equality, 
sexual orientation and internationality. We also pay attention to 
the integration of employees with disabilities. We have launched 
the initiatives described below for this in Europe.
On an international level, we operate five protected workshops and 
are setting up additional workstations for more than 300 people 
with disabilities at the ŠKODA production sites in the Czech Repub-
lic. In the Czech Republic, these activities won an award as one of 
the “Personnel Projects of 2018”.
Our responsibility for keeping employees in valuable activities for 
their entire career if possible also extends to the needs of employ-
ees with a restricted working capacity. After all, individual forms of 
work organization can result in higher performance and job satis-
faction levels for these groups of employees. The Work2Work pro-
gram provides a good example. Since 2001, Volkswagen AG has 
opened up new career opportunities within the business for em-
ployees with differing abilities. In Wolfsburg, more than 700 em-
ployees are currently employed in Work2Work jobs in around 130 
different areas.

P E O P L E
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
We want to strengthen not only our employees’ specialist skills but 
also their health. This is important if they are to perform well at 
work and cope with physical and mental stress which is typical 
when working in a changing production company. In the area of 
health, sustainability means for us that as many employees as pos-
sible can retire from work healthy. This long-term approach also 
helps our Group to cope with demographic change in the form of 
an aging population, which is now typical of many industrial coun-
tries in which we operate. 
Holistic health management at Volkswagen already goes far be-
yond the statutory preventive healthcare and occupational health 
and safety requirements. It also includes aspects such as work or-
ganization, ergonomics, prevention, integration and rehabilitation, 
along with leadership culture. 
HOLISTIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT
Our employees receive medical care at all our sites in accordance with 
the relevant national legal regulations and internal rules and on the 
basis of Group guidelines on protecting and promoting health. All 
Group sites have at least one facility for dealing with medical emer-
gencies. Most of them also offer medical care provided by a company 
doctor.
A Group policy regulates the responsibility for occupational health 
and safety uniformly for all companies of the Group. New occupation-
al health and safety requirements are addressed in cross-brand steer-
ing committees and prepared for implementation in the companies.
PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
In addition to meeting statutory requirements, Volkswagen’s 
Health Department focuses to a large extent on preventive ap-
proaches. Employees are therefore offered regular checkups. In fis-
cal year 2019, 2,213 initial and 5,166 subsequent checkups were car-
ried out by the Health Department. Since the introduction of the 
service in 2010, a total of 91,170 Volkswagen checkups have been 
completed. As part of the discussion of the checkup findings, em-
ployees are offered customized healthcare services. New scientific 
knowledge is piloted in this context and quickly made available to 
employees. One example of this in 2019 was a pilot project by Audi 
BKK and Hanover Medical School (MHH) for reducing the risk fac-
tors in the case of metabolic syndrome, such as high levels of body 
fat, blood lipids and blood pressure. Telemonitoring, exercise pro-
grams, nutritional advice and customer support services have led to 
significant improvements in combination with modern technologies 
such as wearables, in particular among shift workers. Another of 
the Health Department’s tasks is to advise the Group on the intro-
duction of new production technologies that may have an impact 
on employee health.
GREATER OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY THROUGH THE SAFETY FIRST 
STRATEGY
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the 
continuous improvement of occupational health and safety is vi-
tally important to us. In 2004, the Volkswagen Group established 
an internationally valid occupational health and safety policy. 
Among other things, it is intended to ensure compliance with legal 
requirements and the development of concepts in Group compa-
nies for continually improving occupational health and safety at 
work. This policy is currently being revised.
In the area of occupational health and safety, sustainability means 
for us that employees do not suffer accidents when working. 
Volkswagen is supporting this objective through the introduction of 
the Safety First strategy. The strategy requires all Volkswagen Group 
production sites to comply with the ISO 45001 standards and more 
specific Group requirements. The corresponding management sys-
tems will be introduced by the Group brands themselves by the 
end of 2021.
A Group process standard was introduced to provide cross-brand 
information in the event of serious or fatal accidents involving our 
own employees or workers from partner firms. On this basis, spe-
cific measures can be taken to prevent similar accidents across all 
our sites in the future.
The Health Department and the Occupational Health and Safety 
Department carried out the first cross-brand internal audits in ac-
cordance with the new ISO 45001 in Mexico at the Volkswagen 
 Guanajuato and Audi San José Chiapa sites in October 2019 as part of 
the Safety First strategy. The interdisciplinary and cross-brand col-
laboration and auditing support the sites in reaching the ISO 45001 
international standard required and the related Volkswagen Group 
requirements. In order to track the long-term trend in accidents, 
figures on accident frequency and accident severity are collected 
for the Volkswagen Group’s production sites. These figures were 
lower in 2019 compared to the previous year.
RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER IN THE MIDDLE OF SOCIETY
With the HR policy concepts, measures and initiatives presented 
here, we make it clear: Volkswagen AG wants to be a good and fair 
employer that addresses the concerns of all its stakeholders in an 
open discussion as well as a company that lives up to its responsi-
bility as an employer and towards society. We use a large number of 
levers for this. The repertoire of our HR tools ranges from innova-
tive remuneration models and working-time models through par-
ticipation mechanisms that have been rolled out Group-wide 
through social initiatives at our sites to a systematic diversity man-
agement system and diverse preventive healthcare options.

ABOUT THIS REPORT
REPORT STRUCTURE
The Volkswagen Group is committed to providing transparency to 
all its stakeholder groups. For the third time, this Group Sustaina-
bility Report 2019 includes a combined separate nonfinancial re-
port that complies with sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 of 
the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code), herein-
after referred to as the “nonfinancial report”. The nonfinancial re-
port serves to meet the disclosure requirements of the CSR Richt-
linie-Umsetzungsgesetz (CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive 
Implementation Act).
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are highlighted. 
The Group Sustainability Report 2019 is supplemented by a de-
tailed description of the sustainability activities of our brands and 
regions and of the Volkswagen Group’s CSR projects. This additional 
information, which does not form part of the nonfinancial report, 
can be found on the Volkswagen Group’s corporate website at: 
 
 www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting
The latest continuously updated news on sustainability in the 
Volkswagen Group can be found on the Group portal at:
 
 www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability
Further information regarding sustainability can be found in our 
separate sustainability magazine, Shift 2019, at:

BASIS FOR REPORT
For reporting year 2019, Volkswagen AG will for the third time issue 
a nonfinancial statement at company level and a nonfinancial Group 
statement, which will be published together as a combined sepa-
rate nonfinancial report in the sense of HGB sections 289b para. 3 
and 315b para. 3 as part of the Group Sustainability Report 2019. 
The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB sec-
tion 315c, in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. Further-
more, the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
were used as the framework for drawing up the nonfinancial re-
port. In this nonfinancial report, Volkswagen has systematically 
used the GRI Standards as the underlying structure for the materi-
ality analysis and reports on management approaches as well as 
the specific standard disclosures. In line with CSR-RUG, this non-
financial report will concentrate on those action areas that are nec-
essary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s business 
development, overall performance and position as well as the 
Volkswagen Group’s influence on nonfinancial aspects.
Unless indicated otherwise, any information provided for the 
Group also applies to Volkswagen AG. In addition to Volkswagen AG, 
the Group includes all major subsidiaries inside and outside Germany 
that are directly or indirectly controlled by Volkswagen AG. In the 
financial data, our joint ventures in China are reported using the 
equity accounting method. However, they are included in full 
(100%) in volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) 
and in environmentally relevant data.
In terms of content, the Group Sustainability Report was prepared 
in compliance with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initia-
tive (GRI), applying the “Core” option. Every chapter on a focus is-
sue in the report consists of a text section followed by an appendix 
with a target program and tables of key indicators for that chapter. 
At the same time, the GRI Content Index shows how we are imple-
menting the requirements of the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and are using as guidance the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the criteria of the German 
Sustainability Code (DNK). The GRI Content Index has been separat-
ed from the Sustainability Report 2019 and can be found as a sepa-
rate document in the Group portal at:
 
 www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting
Important ideas for the report’s content were provided by the ques-
tionnaires and appraisals of sustainability-oriented rating agen-
cies. We also took our lead from Stakeholder Engagement Standard 
AA1000.
To validate issues of material significance for the Volkswagen 
Group resulting from various global challenges, we drew upon the 
findings of the Volkswagen Group’s Stakeholder Panel, which has 
been in place for many years now, as well as the results of the latest 
comprehensive stakeholder surveys conducted by Group compa-
nies Audi, MAN, Porsche and Volkswagen Financial Services.
To manage its sustainability performance, the Volkswagen Group 
records strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance 
with the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and 
the framework for ESG (environment, social and governance) indi-
cators defined by the European Federation of Financial Analysts’ 
Societies (EFFAS). Increasingly, shareholders and investors are call-
ing for transparency, making them an important target group for 
our sustainability reporting.
The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators presented 
in previous years. We have made no changes to the methods used 
to collect and measure the data on our sustainability performance. 
The Volkswagen Group’s global production network comprised 124 
production sites as of the end of the reporting year. This is now the 
eighth time we have reported our emissions in line with Scope 3 of 
the WBCSD/WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG).

REPORT AUDITING
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft 
(PwC) conducted a voluntary, limited assurance engagement in ac-
cordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the combined separate 
GRI 102-45, 102-48, 102-49, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52

nonfinancial report prepared in accordance with HGB sections 
289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 to verify that its disclosures comply 
with the relevant statutory requirements and with the relevant cri-
teria of the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Re-
porting Initiative.
Further information on the engagement can be found in the inde-
pendent practitioner’s report on a limited assurance engagement 
on the nonfinancial reporting.
ADDITIONAL REPORTING WITHIN THE GROUP
The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB sec-
tion 315c, in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. By refer-
encing this combined separate nonfinancial report, all Group com-
panies required by national legislation to disclose nonfinancial and 
diversity-related information pursuant to Directive 2014/95/EU are 
exempted from the obligation to submit their own nonfinancial 
reports.
More detailed insights into our environmental management ap-
proach can be found in the environmental statements published by 
numerous Group locations as part of their voluntary participation 
in the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The 
sustainability reports published by the Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania 
and ŠKODA brands also bear testimony to the Group’s commitment 
to sustainability.
EDITORIAL NOTES
The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group as a 
whole. Where information relates to individual Group divisions only, 
this is clearly indicated in the text.
REPORTING PRACTICES
The nonfinancial report and Group Sustainability Report are pub-
lished annually. In addition to information about the Group’s sustain-
ability activities in the 2019 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 
2019), the sustainability report also contains selected information 
from the 2020 fiscal year.
The editorial deadline was February 6, 2020. Both reports appear in 
German and English. The next nonfinancial report will be published 
in the first quarter of 2021, and we anticipate that the next Group 
Sustainability Report will appear in the second quarter of 2021.
LEGAL INFORMATION
This sustainability report contains statements relating to the fu-
ture business development of the Volkswagen Group. These state-
ments are based on assumptions regarding the development of the 
economic and legal conditions in individual countries and eco-
nomic regions, and in particular as they relate to the automotive 
industry, which we have made on the basis of the information 
available to us and which we consider to be realistic at the time of 
publication. The estimates given entail a degree of risk, and actual 
developments may differ from those forecast. Any changes in sig-
nificant parameters relating to our key sales markets, or any signif-
icant shifts in exchange rates relevant to the Volkswagen Group, 
will have a corresponding impact on the development of our busi-
ness. In addition, there may be departures from our expected busi-
ness development if the assessments of the factors influencing sus-
tainable value enhancement, and of risks and opportunities, 
presented in this sustainability report develop in a way other than 
we expect at the time of publication, or if additional risks and op-
portunities or other factors emerge that affect the development of 
our business.
CALCULATION OF FLEET EMISSIONS IN EUROPE
The figure for Group fleet CO₂ emissions is the figure annually re-
corded in the course of official monitoring pursuant to “Regulation 
(EC) 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new pas-
senger cars as part of the Community’s integrated approach to re-
duce CO₂ emissions from light-duty vehicles” by the European En-
vironment Agency (EEA) on behalf of the European Commission for 
the brands belonging to the group of connected manufacturers 
“VW Group PC”. This figure is the volume-weighted average of all 
specific CO₂ emissions from new passenger cars registered for the 
first time in the respective calendar year, based on the calculation 
logic defined in EU Regulation 443/2009. Provided that the figure 
for fleet CO₂ emissions is set down in a Commission Implementing 
Decision to confirm or amend the average specific CO₂ emissions 
and specific emissions targets for manufacturers of passenger cars 
for the respective calendar year in accordance with Regulation (EC) 
443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, this fig-
ure is published; otherwise, provisional CO₂ emissions figures are 
published, which are evaluated on the basis of internal systems us-
ing the same logic.

ABOUT THE NONFINANCIAL REPORT
The following index provides an overview of the disclosures re-
quired for the nonfinancial report in accordance with HGB section 
315c in conjunction with sections 289c to 289e, together with ap-
propriate references to the sections of this Group Sustainability Re-
port in which these disclosures may be found.
PwC has conducted a voluntary limited assurance engagement in 
accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the elements of the Group 
Sustainability Report that make up the nonfinancial report.
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are highlighted.
References to disclosures outside the combined management re-
port are supplementary information and do not form part of the 
nonfinancial report.
Based on various global challenges, the Volkswagen Group has 
drawn up a list of 16 key action areas. This analysis was based on 
external studies, industry analyses and stakeholder surveys as well 
as internal policies and guidelines from our different divisions. 
These action areas were largely defined on the basis of the findings 
of expert workshops held in the past that addressed topics relating 
to the economy, the environment and civil society.
In the course of evaluating the statutory reporting requirements, 
Volkswagen expanded its materiality analysis in 2017 and revised 
the action areas in terms of the requirements of the CSR Directive 
Implementation Act (CSR-RUG): in line with CSR-RUG, this non-
financial report will concentrate on those action areas that are nec-
essary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s business 
development, overall performance and position as well as the 
Volkswagen Group’s influence on nonfinancial aspects. The action 
areas identified during the 2017 materiality analysis were revised 
in the 2019 reporting year.

Reportable connections have been identified in this nonfinancial report to amounts reported in the 2019 annual or consolidated financial statements.
Additional special items in connection with the diesel issue amounting to € 2.3 billion were recognized in fiscal year 2019. Charges of € 2.6 billion were recognized under other operating ex-
penses, which arose from the administrative fine order of € 0.5 billion issued in May 2019 by the Stuttgart Public Prosecutor, which ended the ongoing regulatory offense proceeding against 
Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, and higher provisions for legal risks result. This was set against the reversal of reserves for technical measures of € 0.3 billion, which reduced cost of sales.
An amount of around € 2.9 billion has been included in the provisions for litigation and legal risks as of December 31, 2019 to hedge the currently known legal risks related to the diesel issue 
based on existing knowledge and current assessments.
The contingent liabilities that exist in connection with the diesel issue total € 3.7 billion, of which € 3.4 billion results from lawsuits filed by investors in Germany. In addition, information 
on these amounts reported in the annual financial statements can be found in the Annual Report in the “Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets” chapter and in the “Report 
on Risk and Opportunities” under the headings “Environmental protection regulations”, “Litigation” and “Diesel Issue” (particularly “Assessment of risks arising from the diesel issue”).

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE  
ENGAGEMENT ON NONFINANCIAL REPORTING
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the com-
bined separate non-financial report pursuant to §§ (Articles) 289b 
Abs. (paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: 
“German Commercial Code”) of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, (here-
inafter the “Company”) for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 
December 2019 (hereinafter the “Nonfinancial Report”).
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315c 
in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the principles stated in 
the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Ini-
tiative (hereinafter the “GRICriteria”).
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the 
selection and application of appropriate methods of non-financial 
reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to 
individual non-financial disclosures which are reasonable in the 
circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsi-
ble for such internal control as they have considered necessary to 
enable the preparation of a Non-financial Report that is free from 
material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL OF THE AUDIT FIRM
We have complied with the German professional provisions re-
garding independence as well as other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and profes-
sional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German 
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung 
für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as 
well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut 
der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; 
IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW Qual-
itätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualitäts-
sicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW QS 1) – and accord-
ingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control 
including documented policies and procedures regarding compli-
ance with ethical requirements, professional standards and appli-
cable legal and regulatory requirements.
PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on 
the Non-financial Report based on the assurance engagement we 
have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement, we did not perform an audit 
on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to 
in the Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Re-
vised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Stand-
ard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement 
to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s 
Non-financial Report for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 De-
cember 2019 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in ac-
cordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and 
the relevant GRI-Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement, the assurance procedures are 
less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The 
assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s 
judgment. 
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed 
amongst others the following assurance procedures and further 
activities:
• Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainabil-
ity organization and of the conduction of the materiality 
analysis
• Inquiries of relevant managerial personnel involved in the 
preparation of the Non-financial Report regarding the prepara-
tion process, the internal control system relating to this process 
as well as disclosures in the Non-financial Report
• Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the 
Non-financial Report
• Analytical evaluation of disclosures in the Non-financial Report
• Evaluation of the implementation of group management re-
quirements, processes and specifications regarding data collec-
tion through on-site visits at selected sites and brands of the VW 
Group

in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction 
with 289c to 289e HGB and the relevant GRI-Criteria.

“The coronavirus pandemic hit the Volkswagen Group at the start of 2020, in the middle of one of 
the largest transformation processes in the history of our Group. From the start, our focus has been 
on protecting our employees and our business against the threat of COVID-19. Despite this massive 
challenge, at the same time we further advanced the Group’s restructuring toward decarbonization 
and mobility for future generations. My express thanks go to everyone who successfully contributed 
to this, specifically to our 662,000 employees of the Volkswagen Group around the world and to our 
stakeholders.”

FOREWORD
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Dear colleagues,
Volkswagen has lived up to its corporate responsibility even in 2020, the year of the coronavirus. 
As one of the largest employers in the world, the Group coordinated and donated aid supplies 
internationally, conducted 25,000 coronavirus tests, organized employee projects and produced 
medical equipment. Thanks to the broad product portfolio and regional positioning, the Group 
has remained financially robust while navigating the crisis.
At the same time, addressing the consequences of the pandemic has provided an opportunity for 
sustainable economic restructuring: in 2020, three times more electric vehicles were sold than in 
the previous year. The Group has launched a unique e-model offensive with the Volkswagen ID.3 
and ID.4, the Porsche Taycan, Audi e-tron and Skoda Enyaq iV as well as numerous hybrid models. 
In 2020, we tripled our unit sales of e-vehicles in the Group and were able to reduce our CO2 fleet 
average in the EU by around 20 percent. We are convinced that the battery-electric drive is, for 
the foreseeable future, the only solution for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Within 
the Group we have also set the goal of attaining a climate-neutral footprint worldwide by 2050 
at the latest – this includes our supply chains, plants and business divisions and our customers’ 
use of the vehicles.
On our path to climate-neutral mobility, we seek to collaborate with society and politicians. We 
believe that a reduction in CO2 emissions within the scope of the EU Green Deal of at least 55% by 
2030 compared to 1990 levels is attainable, if the appropriate measures are implemented across 
all sectors as part of a joint effort. As a member of the Europe-wide CEO Alliance, we are therefore 
working on the cross-sectoral decarbonization of the economy. Volkswagen sees itself as part of 
the solution, not the problem.
For Volkswagen, social sustainability is just as important as environmental. The focus on e-mobil-
ity will change employment at Volkswagen. A study carried out for Volkswagen by the Fraunhofer 
Bernd Osterloh, 
Chairman of the General and 
Group Works Council of Volkswagen AG
GRI 102-14, 102-15, 
102-16

Institute has worked out exactly how. The experts say that in the next ten years, job creation, job 
improvement and job elimination will coexist. The findings show that Volkswagen’s employ-
ment needs are going to fall less sharply than previous studies had suggested due to e-mobility 
and digitalization. 
We can sustainably manage the transformation of the workforce if the right measures are intro-
duced. At Volkswagen, these primarily include additional training and retraining, the transfor-
mation of the components segment in the Group and the Digital Transformation Roadmap. 
Profitability is a prerequisite for job security.
The Fraunhofer study was commissioned by the Volkswagen’s Sustainability Council. It contributes 
external, international and cross-sectoral sustainability expertise to our strategies. In 2020, we 
extended collaboration with the Council by a further two years.
In addition to ad hoc management of the coronavirus crisis, Volkswagen has continued to focus 
on its competitiveness, securing jobs, the future viability of jobs, protecting health and enabling a 
work/life balance. Our Social Charter has also undergone revision.
We successfully completed the Monitorship in 2020 that was part of the agreements with the US 
authorities following the diesel issue. In collaboration with Larry Thompson and his monitor 
team, Volkswagen met its commitment to sustainably improve compliance within the Company. 
The change in structures, processes and systems has made us a stronger business. Together 
with our employees, we will continue work on the change in corporate culture in the future – 
integrity is not a project with a beginning and an end but an ongoing task. 
As part of our sustainability strategy, we have succeeded in anchoring sustainability more firmly 
in the Group’s core business. We set ourselves strong, measurable targets for the four focus areas 
of decarbonization, circular economy, responsibility in the supply chain & business and trans-
formation of the workforce. This ensures an effective operationalization of sustainability, with 
clear responsibilities and processes. 
Sustainable business practices are also playing an increasingly important role for our investors. 
We are taking this into account by anchoring an ESG action plan in our Group strategy and in 
doing so, want to contribute to permanently increasing our Company’s value. The Volkswagen 
Group’s readmission to the UN Global Compact at the start of 2021 is another signal of confi-
dence for our stakeholders and at the same time proof of our strategy’s effectiveness.
The “Shaping mobility – for generations to come” vision of our TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy 
guides us in all our activities. It is our responsibility to contribute to the sustainability of envi-
ronmental, social and economic systems for us and for generations to come. We are working on 
this every day.
Best regards, 
Herbert Diess  
Bernd Osterloh

 ABOUT THIS REPORT
REPORT STRUCTURE
For the fourth time, this 2020 Group Sustainability Report includes 
a combined separate nonfinancial report that complies with sec-
tions 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 of the Handelsgesetzbuch 
(HGB – German Commercial Code), hereinafter referred to as the 
“nonfinancial report”. The nonfinancial report serves to meet the 
disclosure requirements of the CSR Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz 
(CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implementation Act).
The requirements of the CSR-RUG on disclosing nonfinancial infor-
mation in accordance with section 315c in conjunction with sec-
tions 289c to 289e HGB were taken into account in the materiality 
analysis process for the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability narra-
tive. The process also includes an analysis of the United Nations Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs). The nonfinancial report covers 
both the focus areas and the enablers of the materiality analysis. 
In addition, the Sustainability Report takes account of additional GRI 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and sustainability 
rating requirements, stakeholder expectations and special issues.  
Strategy and Management > Sustainability Management
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are highlighted. 
The Group Sustainability Report 2020 is supplemented by a de-
tailed description of the sustainability activities of our brands and 
regions and of the Volkswagen Group’s CSR projects. This additional 
information, which does not form part of the nonfinancial report,

SUSTAINABILITY COMMUNICATION AT VOLKSWAGEN GROUP
BASIS FOR REPORT
For reporting year 2020, Volkswagen AG will for the fourth time issue 
a nonfinancial statement at company level and a nonfinancial Group 
declaration, which will be published together as a combined sepa-
rate nonfinancial report in the sense of HGB sections 289b para. 3 
and 315b para. 3 as part of the 2020 Group Sustainability Report. 
The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB sec-
tion 315c in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. Further-
more, the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
were used as the framework for drawing up the nonfinancial report. 
In this nonfinancial report, Volkswagen has systematically used 
the GRI Standards as the underlying structure for reports on manage-
ment approaches and the specific standard disclosures. In line 
with CSR-RUG, this nonfinancial report will concentrate on focus 
areas and enablers that are necessary for an understanding of the 
Volkswagen Group’s business development, overall performance 
and position as well as the Volkswagen Group’s influence on non-
financial aspects.
The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group as a 
whole. Where information relates to individual Group divisions only, 
this is clearly indicated in the text. Unless indicated otherwise, any 
information provided for the Group also applies to Volkswagen AG. 
In addition to Volkswagen AG, the Group includes all major subsidi-
aries inside and outside Germany that are directly or indirectly 
controlled by Volkswagen AG. Renk AG, which was sold on October 
6, 2020, is not taken into account in this information. In the finan-
cial data, our joint ventures in China are reported using the equity 
accounting method. However, they are included in full (100%) in 
volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) and in pro-
duction-related environmentally relevant data. The management 
approaches described in this report (e.g. the environmental compli-
ance management system (ECMS) and the compliance manage-
ment system for business and human rights (CMS BHR) etc.) apply 
to all the Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies. With our non-
controlled companies, we work to the extent permitted by law to-
ward implementation of the adjusted management approaches. The 
Chinese joint ventures are included in the information on the 
Volkswagen Group in the KPIs and the associated targets on the 
topics of the UEP (the reduction of the environmental impact of 
6
 A B O U T  T H I S  R E P O R T
production), the DCI (the decarbonization index), the Opinion Sur-
vey, the diversity index, accident indices and accident figures. Ex-
cept for the sites under construction, all the Chinese joint ventures’ 
sites have a certified environmental management system and all 
the Chinese joint ventures’ vehicle-producing sites have an occupa-
tional safety management system. The risks of the Chinese market 
are assessed by Volkswagen China Investment Company Ltd. In our 
whistleblower system, whistleblower information concerning our 
Chinese joint ventures is processed via the regional investigation 
office at Volkswagen (China) Investment Company Ltd.
In terms of content, the Group Sustainability Report was prepared 
in compliance with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting 
Initia tive (GRI), applying the “Core” option. The strategy chapter 
and the four following chapters on focus issues in the report con-
sist of a text section; a consolidated KPI table for the entire report 
follows with a breakdown for the respective chapter on a focus is-
sue in the appendix. At the same time, the separate GRI Content In-
dex shows how we are implementing the requirements of the Unit-
ed Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and using the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as guidance. The GRI Con-
tent Index has been separated from the 2020 Sustainability Report 
and can be found as a separate document in the Group portal at:
 
 www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting
The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators presented 
in previous years. Any material changes to the methods used to 
collect and measure the data on our sustainability performance are 
explicitly disclosed by the respective KPIs. All figures shown in the 
report are rounded, so minor discrepancies may arise from addi-
tion of these amounts. All figures in this report on CO2 except for 
the CO2 fleet values correspond to CO2 equivalents.
CALCULATION OF FLEET EMISSIONS IN EUROPE
The CO2 fleet values are determined for each calendar year in ac-
cordance with Regulation (EU) 2019 / 631 within the European Un-
ion (plus Norway and Iceland). They are initially provisionally cal-
culated within the framework of the official monitoring of the 
European Commission (the Directorate-General for Climate Action 
[DG Climate]) with the involvement of the European Environment 
Agency (EEA) and are then published by way of implementing act 
following successful review, amendment where applicable, and 
confirmation. A manufacturer’s CO2 fleet value is the volume- 
weighted average of the CO2 emissions of all the manufacturer’s 
new cars (car fleet value) or new light commercial vehicles (LCV 
fleet value) that are registered for the first time in the respective 
calendar year. If several manufacturers join together in an emis-
sion pool (also known as a pool), a CO2 fleet value is calculated for 
this emission pool from the average of the CO2 emissions of all the 
new vehicle registrations (of cars or light commercial vehicles) of 
the manufacturers in this emission pool. The Group CO2 fleet value 
is the value derived from the official monitoring for the Group 
brands that are members of the “VW-SAIC POOL (open)” emission 
pool. If the Group brands are in an emission pool with third-party 
manufacturers – as was the case in 2020 – the Group CO2 fleet value 
is not derived directly from the published documents. 
REPORT REVIEW
Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (EY) con-
ducted a voluntary, limited assurance engagement in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the combined separate nonfinancial 
report prepared in accordance with HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 
315b para. 3 to verify that its disclosures comply with the relevant 
statutory requirements.
Further information on the engagement can be found in the inde-
pendent practitioner’s report on a limited assurance engagement 
on the nonfinancial reporting.
ADDITIONAL REPORTING WITHIN THE GROUP
The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB sec-
tion 315c in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. By refer-
encing this combined separate nonfinancial report, all Group com-
panies required by national legislation to disclose nonfinancial and 
diversity-related information pursuant to Directive 2014 / 95 / EU 
are exempted from the obligation to submit their own nonfinan-
cial reports.
More detailed insights into our environmental management ap-
proach can be found in the environmental statements published by 
numerous Group locations as part of their voluntary participation 
in the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The 
sustainability reports published by the Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania 
and ŠKODA brands also bear testimony to the Group’s commitment 
to sustainability.
REPORTING PRACTICES
The nonfinancial report and Group Sustainability Report are pub-
lished annually. In addition to information about the Group’s sus-
tainability activities in the 2020 fiscal year (January 1 to December 
31, 2020), the sustainability report also contains selected informa-
tion from the 2021 fiscal year.
The editorial deadline was February 8, 2021. Both reports appear in 
German and English. Both the nonfinancial report and the Group 
Sustainability Report are expected to be published in the first quar-
ter of 2021.

LEGAL INFORMATION
This sustainability report contains statements relating to the fu-
ture business development of the Volkswagen Group. These state-
ments are based on assumptions relating to the development of the 
economic, political and legal environment in individual countries, 
economic regions and markets, and in particular for the automo-
tive industry, which we have made on the basis of the information 
available to us and which we consider to be realistic at the time of 
going to press. The estimates given involve a degree of risk, and the 
actual developments may differ from those forecast. Any changes 
in significant parameters relating to our key sales markets, any sig-
nificant shifts in exchange rates or raw materials relevant to the 
Volkswagen Group or any difference between the actual impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and the scenario assumed in this report will 
have a corresponding effect on the development of our business. In 
addition, there may be departures from our expected business de-
velopment if the assessments of the factors influencing sustainable 
value enhancement, and of risks and opportunities, presented in 
this sustainability report develop in a way other than we expect at 
the time of publication, or if additional risks and opportunities or 
other factors that affect the development of our business emerge. 
This version of the annual report is a translation of the German 
original. The German takes precedence.

OUTLINE OF THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
Volkswagen AG is the parent company of the Volkswagen Group. 
The parent company’s head office is Wolfsburg. It develops vehicles 
and components for the Group’s brands, but also produces and sells 
vehicles – in particular passenger cars and light commercial vehi-
cles – under the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Com-
mercial Vehicles brands. In its capacity as parent company, 
Volkswagen AG holds direct or indirect interests in AUDI AG, 
SEAT S.A., ŠKODA AUTO a.s., Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, TRATON SE, 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG, Volkswagen Bank GmbH and a 
large number of other companies in Germany and abroad. 
More detailed disclosures can be found in the list of shareholdings 
in accordance with sections 285 and 313 of the Handelsgesetzbuch 
(HGB – German Commercial Code) or accessed on our website:
 
 www.volkswagenag.com/en/InvestorRelations.html
Volkswagen AG is a vertically integrated energy supply company as 
defined by section 3 no. 38 of the Energiewirtschaftsgesetz (EnWG – 
German Energy Industry Act) and is therefore subject to the provi-
sions of the EnWG. In the electricity sector, Volkswagen AG generates, 
sells and distributes electricity together with Group subsidiaries.
Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group are managed by the 
Volkswagen AG Board of Management in accordance with the 
Volkswagen AG Articles of Association and the rules of procedure 
for Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management issued by the Supervi-
sory Board.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups in 
the automotive industry. The Group’s business activities comprise 
the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All brands within 
the Automotive Division – with the exception of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands – are 
independent legal entities. 
The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Commer-
cial Vehicles and Power Engineering business areas. The Passenger 
Cars Business Area essentially consolidates the Volkswagen Group’s 
passenger car brands and the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
brand. Activities focus on the development of vehicles and engines, 
the production and sale of passenger cars and light commercial ve-
hicles, and the genuine parts business. The product portfolio ex-
tends from small cars through to luxury vehicles in the premium 
segment, and also includes motorcycles, and will be supplemented 
by mobility services as needed.
For further information, see the “Structure and Business Activities” 
chapter in the Annual Report.
 
  2020 Annual Report > Group Management Report > Structure 
and Business Activities
LEGAL FACTORS INFLUENCING BUSINESS
With its brands, the Volkswagen Group is present in all relevant 
markets around the world. The key sales markets currently include 
Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, Russia, Poland, Turkey and 
Mexico.
Like other international companies, the business of the Volkswagen 
companies is affected by numerous laws in Germany and abroad. 
In particular, there are legal requirements relating to development, 
products, production and distribution as well as supervisory, data 
protection, financial, company, commercial, capital-market, anti-
trust and tax regulations and regulations relating to labor, bank-
ing, state-aid, energy, environmental and insurance law.
In addition to the Finance & IT, Human Resources and Integrity & 
Legal Affairs divisions, the Volkswagen Group works together 
across six Group Board of Management business areas and the Chi-
na region. Our management model means better use can be made 
of existing economies of scale, synergy effects can be boosted more 
systematically and decision-making can be accelerated. In addition, 
this prepares the Volkswagen Group for a management structure 
that is simpler, leaner and more effective, and strengthens the 
brands, giving them more autonomy. In line with the principle of 
subsidiarity, decisions will be taken at the lowest competent level, 
close to business operations.

THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE AS A BLUEPRINT FOR 
SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance provides the regulatory framework for cor-
porate management and supervision. This includes a company’s 
organization and values, and the principles and guidelines for its 
business policy. The German Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code) contains principles, recommendations and suggestions for 
corporate management and supervision. Its recommendations and 
suggestions were prepared by a dedicated government commission 
on the basis of the material provisions and nationally and interna-
tionally accepted standards of sound, responsible corporate gov-
ernance. In line with best practice, the government commission 
regularly reviews these for relevance in light of current develop-
ments and updates them as necessary. The Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG base their work on 
the Code’s principles, recommendations and suggestions. The devi-
ations from the recommendations can be found in our declaration 
of compliance. We consider good corporate governance to be a key 
prerequisite for achieving a lasting increase in the Company’s val-
ue. It helps strengthen the trust of our shareholders, customers, 
employees, business partners and investors in our work and en-
ables us to meet the steadily increasing demand for information 
from national and international stakeholders. You can find our 
published Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate 
Governance Code here:

THE VOLKSWAGEN VALUE CHAIN
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
The Volkswagen Group is further advancing its transformation to a digital mobility group and will invest around €73 billion in capex and devel-
opment costs for e-mobility, hybridization and digitalization in the next five years.
PROCUREMENT
Every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, components and other goods. A sustainable supply chain and envi-
ronmentally compatible transportation are vital for fully assuming responsibility for human rights, environmental protection and the battle 
against corruption.
PRODUCTION
Every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of around 36,000 vehicles globally. Efficient production ranks alongside environ-
mental protection and employee health and safety as one of our core goals.
MARKETING & SALES
Business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term and stable partnerships. The Volkswagen Group’s share of commercial fleet cus-
tomers is 42.1% in Germany and 26.5% in the rest of Europe.
AFTER-SALES & FINANCIAL SERVICES
Our service includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality advice and maintenance, managing our original parts business, 
and providing vehicle-related financial services.
RECYCLING
In addition to recycling vehicles at the end of their useful life, we pay close attention during the new-vehicle development stage to the recycla-
bility of the required materials, the use of high-quality recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants.

OUR FUTURE-ORIENTED PROGRAM TOGETHER 2025+
With the future-oriented program TOGETHER – Strategy 2025 an-
nounced in 2016, we are seeking to make the Volkswagen Group 
more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented and sus-
tainable, and systematically geared toward generating profitable 
growth.
We at the Volkswagen Group have set ourselves the goal of contin-
uing to excite our customers in future and meeting their diverse 
needs with an appealing product portfolio of impressive vehicles 
and forward-looking, tailor-made mobility solutions. Every day, 
we actively assume and exercise responsibility in relation to the 
environment, safety and society, and we aim to be a role model in 
these areas. Integrity, reliability, quality and passion thus form 
the basis for our work. Using this approach, we aim for technolog-
ical leadership in the industry and competitive profitability while 
also striving to be an excellent employer.
The TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, which we further developed 
in 2019, steps up the pace at which we will achieve our strategic 
objectives and sharpens our focus. To this end, the strategic vi-
sion of the Volkswagen Group was also revised. With “Shaping 
mobility – for generations to come”, we aim to more actively 
shape the future of mobility while safeguarding it sustainably – 
for present and future generations.
With electric drives, digital connectivity and autonomous driv-
ing, we want to make the automobile cleaner, quieter, more intel-
ligent and safer. At the same time, our core product will become 
more emotive and offer a completely new driving experience. In 
this way, the car can continue to be a cornerstone of sustainable, 
individual and affordable mobility in the future. In addition, we 
are committed to the Paris Agreement on climate protection and 
are one of the first companies in our industry to commit our-
selves to becoming a company with a neutral carbon footprint by 
2050. This includes our vehicles, our plants and all processes.
The automotive industry is being shaped particularly by the 
transformation to e-mobility and digitalization. We have posi-
tioned ourselves to successfully tackle this radical change: the 
strategies of our brands and regions as well as those of our func-
tional areas are consistently aligned with the TOGETHER 2025+ 
Group strategy.
Under the umbrella of the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, we 
have defined five central modules that put the focus on corporate 
governance, improved performance, increased brand equity, soft-
ware and excellence in employee management.
Our Code of Collaboration, along with our integrity and compli-
ance program Together4Integrity (T4I), is a central pillar of the 
Group strategy. This Code describes how collaboration is to take 
place within the Group and between individuals in their day-to-
day work. Its core values are encapsulated in the terms “genuine”, 
“straightforward”, “open-minded”, “as equals” and “united”. T4I 
brings together all activities relating to integrity, culture, compli-
ance, risk management and human resources, creating a common 
path toward a new corporate culture.
FIVE MODULES OF THE TOGETHER 2025+ STRATEGY
Our TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy comprises consistent strate-
gic decisions and specific modules aimed at safeguarding the long-
term future of the Group and generating profitable growth.
These modules are namely Best Governance, Best Performance, 
Best Brand Equity, Software-enabled Car Company and Excellent 
Leadership. We continuously review the status and progress of 
these initiatives in order to analyze the target achievement, impor-
tance and suitability of the measures defined. This enables us to 
tailor these modules to the transformation underway within our 
company.
In the Best Governance module, we are working to create a focused, 
streamlined corporate structure to manage the brands, continually 
leverage synergies and accelerate decision-making processes. We 
want the Group to be perceived as efficiently managed, trustwor-
thy, sustainable and transparent. To this end, we are intensifying 
the dialog with our key stakeholders and systematically reviewing 
whether we are still the best owner for our various brands and 
companies. In addition, we want to make our CO2 targets mea sur-
able and make our progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 
2050 transparent. Within international ESG rankings (ESG = envi-
ronment, social, governance), we strive for a leading position in our 
industry in the future.
The aim of the Best Performance module is to achieve a sustainable 
value enhancement in our enterprise by increasing efficiency, pro-
ductivity and profitability. As a global company, our size enables us 
to make increased use of economies of scale. We remain firmly 
committed to our ambitious targets, work consistently on achiev-
ing them and strive to exceed them. This will lay the foundations 
for extensive investment in our Company, in our employees and in 
mobility for present and future generations.
In the Best Brand Equity module, the focus is on realigning and fur-
ther refining the brand portfolio, making a significant increase in 
the value of our Group brands possible. We are defining the pro-
files, brand missions and core competitors of the Volkswagen Group 
brands in a more nuanced and distinctive way. This will enable the 
Group to better serve the market as a whole. Based on these optimi-
zations, we will decide on the future design, product portfolio and 
services of each Group brand – using the needs of our customers as 
a starting point.
12
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
In the Software-enabled Car Company module, we are working to 
make software development one of the Volkswagen Group’s core 
competencies. To achieve this, we are pooling existing expertise, 
substantially strengthening our resources and establishing a dedi-
cated organizational unit. Going forward, all new vehicle models 
across the Group will be based on our own cross-brand software 
platform. This approach will provide the opportunity to leverage 
synergies between the individual brands and vehicle projects. The 
aim is that the Volkswagen Group and its brands will stand not 
only for the best vehicles but in equal measure for exciting digital 
products and services.
The Excellent Leadership module is based on three main areas: 
communication, human resources development and collaboration. 
To remain competitive and fit for the future, we are shifting to a 
more open, more partnership-based and more value-based leader-
ship culture. We are developing digital and dialog-oriented com-
munication formats to achieve a quicker flow of information and 
even stronger connectivity across all brands and regions. We are 
completely restructuring management development and training 
and taking an even more systematic approach to succession plan-
ning so that, at our Group, the right talent is always in the right po-
sition at the right time. We are also defining clear expectations for 
the Group’s managers. These involve greater customer focus, more 
corporate responsibility, greater effectiveness and focus on results 
as well as a culture of constructive dissent and a positive approach 
in dealing with mistakes. Volkswagen also wants to increase diver-
sity at all levels of the company and is pursuing clear, measurable 
targets for raising the proportion of female and international 
managers.
GROUP STRATEGY GOALS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The five strategic modules describe how we want to achieve our vi-
sion of sustainable mobility for present and future generations. We 
are managing our project using four target dimensions, which are 
also reflected in the Volkswagen strategy rhombus. The four target 
dimensions are as follows: excited customers, excellent employer, 
role model for environment, safety and integrity, and competitive 
profitability. We want to grow sustainably by consistently pursuing 
these objectives.
The target dimensions apply throughout the whole Group. The stra-
tegic KPIs that we use to measure how well we have implemented 
our Group strategy depend on the respective business model, as the 
business model for our passenger car-producing brands is different 
from the business model for trucks and buses and also differs from 
the business model for our Power Engineering business area and 
our services business.
The strategic KPIs of the competitive profitability target dimension 
have been defined and standardized. As the Group strategy is cur-
rently being revised and specified in detail, the content of some 
strategic KPIs in the other target dimensions is still being deter-
mined. The relevance of the KPIs is reviewed at Group level and 
their focus is continuously monitored and adjusted as necessary.

TARGET DIMENSION: EXCITED CUSTOMERS
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our custom-
ers and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to exceed our 
customers’ expectations, thus generating maximum customer 
benefit. This requires not only the best products, the most efficient 
solutions and the best service, but also flawless quality and an out-
standing image. We want to excite our existing customers, win 
over new ones and retain their loyalty in the long term – because 
only loyal and faithful customers will recommend us to others.
The strategic KPIs consist of the conquest rate and KPIs pertaining 
to loyalty, customer satisfaction and quality. 
These KPIs are explained in more detail in the “Sustainable Value 
Enhancement” section of the Annual Report.

TARGET DIMENSION: EXCELLENT EMPLOYER
To achieve sustainable success, we need skilled and dedicated em-
ployees. We aim to increase their satisfaction and motivation by 
means of equal opportunities, an attractive and modern working 
environment, and a forward-looking organization of work. An ex-
emplary management and corporate culture forms the basis for 
this, allowing us to retain our core workforce and attract new 
talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension cover internal employer 
attractiveness determined by means of the opinion survey, exter-
nal employer attractiveness, an external employer ranking as well 
as the diversity index.
 
 Workforce Transformation
TARGET DIMENSION: ROLE MODEL FOR ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY 
AND INTEGRITY
Every day, we at the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise re-
sponsibility in issues relating to the environment, safety and socie-
ty. This aspiration should be reflected in our thoughts and actions 
and in all our decisions. We pay particular attention to the use of 
resources and the emissions of our product portfolio, sites and 
plants. Our goal is to continuously reduce our carbon footprint 
and lower our pollutant emissions. Through innovations and out-
standing quality, we aim for high product safety.
Our primary objectives in this process include complying with 
laws and regulations, establishing secure processes and dealing 
openly with mistakes so that they can be avoided or rectified in the 
future. In terms of integrity, Volkswagen aims to become a role 
model for a modern, transparent and successful enterprise.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension consist of the decarbon-
ization index and fleet CO2 emissions figures, compliance, a culture 
of dealing openly with mistakes, and integrity.
 
 Circular Economy
TARGET DIMENSION: COMPETITIVE PROFITABILITY
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations 
as regards interest payments and debt repayments. As equity hold-
ers, they expect appropriate dividends and a long-term value en-
hancement of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth 
and strengthening our competitiveness, thus keeping the 
Volkswagen Group on a firm footing in the future and ensuring it 
remains an attractive investment option.
The goals we have set ourselves are operational excellence in all 
business processes and becoming the benchmark for the entire 
industry.
The strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen 
Group figures.

SUSTAINABILITY AND MATERIALITY
NEW MATERIALITY ANALYSIS RESULTS IN FOUR FOCUS AREAS
We continued revising our materiality analysis in 2020, having be-
gun the process the previous year, and established a new strategic 
basis for sustainability with the creation of the sustainability nar-
rative for the Volkswagen Group. Some 60 stakeholders were in-
volved in this process, including decision-makers from various di-
visions and brands as well as representatives of the Group 
Sustainability Council.
The materiality process is used to identify and evaluate the most 
important sustainability issues for the Group. 
The decisive factors here are the impact on the environment and 
society, stakeholder expectations, the Volkswagen AG business 
model and compliance with legal requirements and internationally 
established reporting standards. 
The sustainability strategy developed on the basis of the materiali-
ty analysis focuses on the material sustainability topics within the 
TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, which is supported by the “Shap-
ing mobility – for generations to come” vision and the seven Group 
Essentials. This is because a consistent sustainability narrative 
clearly illustrates for the first time how the Volkswagen Group in-
tends to achieve its overarching strategic objective of sustainable 
growth by 2030. This should not only lay the foundation for man-
aging and improving performance in the fields of environment, so-
cial and governance but also strengthen trust among stakeholders 
and on the financial market.
At the start of the materiality process, an analysis of the Group’s ex-
isting sustainability activities was made and a cross-sectoral list of 
relevant sustainability topics compiled. Subsequently, the order of 
priority of the topics for developing the narrative was worked out. 
This was based on an internationally oriented IT- and AI-supported 
data analysis of the key sustainability topics from an external per-
spective with an evaluation of media and stakeholder positions 
from several tens of thousands of sources. This enabled a bench-
mark survey that made it possible to measure the Volkswagen 
Group’s performance in various ESG areas in relation to its risk ex-
posure and the development of its value. At the same time, internal 
trend analyses were carried out, including using ESG ratings, as were 
interviews with decision-makers and experts within the Group and 
with members of the Sustainability Council. The specially appointed 
Advisory Group in the Volkswagen Group, which consisted of repre-
sentatives of the brands and central corporate functions, played a 
key role. The details of the narrative were worked out in expert 
workshops and with the cooperation of the Advisory Group before 
finally being adopted by the Group Board of Management. Four fo-
cus areas have been defined within this framework:
• Decarbonization
• Circular economy
• Responsibility in supply chains and business
• Workforce transformation
The sustainability narrative was adopted by the Group Board of 
Management as a binding sustainability strategy.

THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP SUSTAINABILITY NARRATIVE
Volkswagen is actively driving the change toward emission-free 
and digitally connected mobility. The Volkswagen Group seeks to 
be a leader in sustainable growth taking account of its stakehold-
ers’ interests. In order to achieve this, we pursue two transforma-
tion targets:
1. goTOzero: For all of our products and mobility solutions, we 
strive to minimize the environmental impacts in accordance 
with laws and standards and throughout the entire life cycle. We 
are committed to the Paris climate targets for 2050 and have 
launched a comprehensive decarbonization program. We want to 
give our entire group a neutral carbon footprint by no later than 
2050. That is why we are electrifying our vehicle portfolio, in-
creasing resource efficiency in manufacturing and driving the 
use of renewable energies.
2. Leading company for automotive software: We strive for techno-
logical leadership in the sector and also want to become a busi-
ness that shapes the change in digitalization. Our vehicles will be 
fully connected in the future and integrate our customers’ digi-
tal world. To make this possible, we aim to transform ourselves 
into a software-driven company and develop a cross-brand plat-
form able to set new industry standards with the Automotive 
Cloud.
By consistently focusing the entire Group on these transformation 
targets and doing business responsibly, we are developing clean, ac-
cessible and intelligent mobility solutions that do not just inspire 
our customers.
Our mobility pledges:
Clean 
  Mobility that contributes to protecting climate, 
 environment and people
Accessible 
  Mobility that is affordable and enables individual 
freedom as well as societal participation
Intelligent 
  Mobility that is an elementary part of people’s 
 digital ecosystem – everywhere and anytime
Inspiring 
  Mobility that satisfies different needs, enables 
 safety and fascinates
We have prioritized the four focus areas that are essential for our 
core business and our performance on the financial market in or-
der to transform the Group with a holistic approach and do busi-
ness responsibly throughout the value chain. The focus areas are 
each underpinned by:
• an ambition to be achieved by 2030
• concrete, measurable objectives with deadlines
• indicators for measuring development progress in relation to the 
objectives
• measures for achieving the objectives
• the development and implementation of programs and 
initiatives
Five key internal processes and structures – which we call en-
ablers – are necessary to strategically anchor and successfully im-
plement the results-oriented focus areas in our Group in the long 
term. These are an integral component of the narrative and com-
prise processes and management approaches that support, pro-
mote and accelerate the implementation of the sustainability 
strategy.
These enablers include:
• Stakeholder engagement: a systematic and continuous dialog 
with all our internal and external stakeholders
• Corporate citizenship: responsibility as a good corporate citizen 
and commitment to social cohesion
• Governance: the highest integrity standards and good corporate 
governance structures as a key prerequisite for achieving a last-
ing increase in the Company’s value
• Digitalization: the understanding to act as an engine of the digi-
tal transformation in the economy and mobility
• Culture change: a culture change in the Group toward more 
openness with a focus on the “WE” at Volkswagen

4 STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS
SDG SURVEY PRIORITIZED 6 TOP SDGS FOR 2030
PRIORITIZED SDGS SUBSTANTIATE THE 4 FOCUS AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE GROUP SUSTAINABILITY NARRATIVE
The Volkswagen Group aims to link its sustainability strategy and 
the activities in the individual focus areas ever more closely with 
achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
As a starting point for this, a survey of around 180 sustainability 
experts and managers in the Volkswagen Group was conducted in 
the reporting year in order to ascertain the current situation re-
garding SDG prioritization and implementation. As a result, SDG 13 
(Climate action) was identified as the primary goal, followed by five 
further goals that were classified as priorities (12 Responsible con-
sumption and production, 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 
8 Decent work and economic growth, 9 Industry, innovation and 
infrastructure, and 7 Affordable and clean energy). These prior-
itized SDGs were assigned to the Group sustainability strategy’s fo-
cus areas. The focus areas thus constitute the strategic framework 
to address the key SDGs for the Group.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURE AND TASKS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY ORGANIZATION
Sustainability means maintaining intact environmental, social 
and economic systems with long-term viability at global, regional 
and local level. The Volkswagen Group can influence these systems 
in various ways and actively takes responsibility to help ensure 
they are sustainable. The Volkswagen Group has established con-
sistent sustainability management. The related structures, process-
es and responsibilities are codified in a separate Group policy. We 
view sustainability management as a continuous improvement 
process (CIP).
The Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG has 
cross-functional overall responsibility for sustainability. Addition-
al responsibility is taken by members of the Board of Management 
with their responsibility for specific management systems relating 
to sustainability and by the Group Steering Committee for Sustain-
ability. The members of this steering committee include managers 
from central Board of Management business areas and representa-
tives of the brands and the Group Works Council. The Group Steer-
ing Committee for Sustainability defines concrete strategic targets 
and programs, sets out measures for uniform cross-business-area, 
cross-brand and cross-regional development of sustainability man-
agement and makes decisions on sustainability-related basic issues 
and positions in the Volkswagen Group.
The Group’s sustainability function (Group Sustainability) coordi-
nates all sustainability-related activities and the Group-wide and 
cross-functional network for sustainability. Communication with 
Group functions, brands and companies is structured via defined 
core processes. They serve to create transparency on external 
requirements and translate these into corporate action. The core 
processes include the sustainability strategy and materiality analy-
sis, stakeholder management, ratings and rankings, sustainability 
policies and sustainability reporting. Group Sustainability is allo-
cated to the Office of the Corporate Secretary and to Group Strategy 
in order to ensure that sustainability is closely linked with the stra-
tegic corporate goals and the core business. It is also responsible for 
the office of the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability.
In addition to the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability, 
regular discussions within the Group-wide sustainability network 
take place through various formats, such as the annual Group Sus-
tainability Summit. At brand level, the brand sustainability manag-
ers carry out the cross-functional coordination of sustainability 
topics, develop the sustainability strategy, are responsible for con-
tent and reporting on sustainability topics within the brand, repre-
sent the brand on sustainability topics externally and coordinate 
with Group Sustainability.
THE SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL AS AN INDEPENDENT DRIVING 
FORCE AND PARTNER
At Group level, the Sustainability Council has a prominent position. 
The advisory committee created in 2016 supports the Volkswagen 
Group with important strategic sustainability topics and is made 
up of internationally renowned experts from the academic world, 
politics and society. The Council establishes its own working meth-
ods and areas of focus independently, has extensive rights for the 
purposes of exchanging information, consultation and initiating 
action, and consults regularly with the Board of Management, top 
management and the employee representatives.

S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group extended its collabo-
ration with the Sustainability Council by two more years. Further-
more, Rebecca Harms, former Member of the European Parliament, 
and Magdalena Gerger, CEO and President of the Swedish enter-
prise Systembolaget AB, became new members of the Council. In 
return, Gesche Joost and Yves Leterme are leaving the Council at 
the end of the first term of office.
The agenda for the intensified dialog between Volkswagen and the 
Sustainability Council in 2020 included the CEO Alliance for Eu-
rope’s Recovery, Reform and Resilience, which was jointly launched 
by the Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG 
and the Council to support the EU Green Deal; aspects of corporate 
governance and integrity; decarbonization; employment in times 
of advancing digitalization and e-mobility; and sustainable action 
in international markets. The Volkswagen Sustainability Council 
also launched two new projects: a research project on distribution 
effects of climate-related fiscal and transport policy with the Mer-
cator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change 
(MCC), which builds on the earlier project on climate-conscious 
transport policy, and a study with the Fraunhofer IAO on the ef-
fects of digitalization and e-mobility on employment. The Open 
Source Lab on Sustainable Mobility concluded its work with the 
publication of the project results during the past year.
ACTION PROGRAM FOR IMPROVING ESG PERFORMANCE
A company’s sustainability performance increasingly often forms 
the basis of recommendations and investment decisions by ana-
lysts and investors. This has a significant impact on companies’ 
share prices and cost of capital.
In the TOGETHER 2025+ strategy, the Volkswagen Group aims to 
achieve a lasting increase in the value of the company. The Group’s 
shareholders also express specific implementation requirements 
with regard to ESG topics and expect verifiable integration of sus-
tainability aspects in all areas of the Group’s activities. At the same 
time, changed regulations and frameworks require further action, 
e.g. the EU’s Taxonomy on Sustainable Activities and Nonfinancial 
Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the UN’s Principles for Responsible 
Investments (PRI).
Financial market players draw on various sources of sustainability 
information to evaluate a company’s environmental, social and 
governance performance. They use a combination of information 
from various rating agencies, their own methods and algorithms 
and the services of data analytics companies. As a result of the die-
sel issue, the Volkswagen Group remains significantly downgraded 
in numerous sustainability ratings and is therefore not represent-
ed in sustainability indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability In-
dex or the FTSE4Good Index. In fiscal year 2020, Volkswagen con-
tinued to have a score of A– in the CDP climate rating and had an A 
rating in the Water Disclosure Project (WDP).
In view of the increasing importance of sustainability ratings, we 
see the current ratings as a clear call for action and are targeting a 
significant improvement. To this end, we have incorporated an ac-
tion plan in the Best Governance module of the TOGETHER 2025+ 
strategy. The aim is to successively improve our performance in se-
lected sustainability ratings by 2025.
In order to achieve this, we identified the challenges for each ESG 
criterion and defined measures, responsibilities and timetables. 
These lean predominantly on the programs derived from the new 
sustainability narrative.
GREEN FINANCE FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTMENTS IN 
SUSTAINABILITY
Massive investment is needed to transform the Volkswagen Group. 
At the same time, investors are looking for sustainable investment 
options. Volkswagen published a Green Finance Framework for the 
first time during the reporting year. This document defines the 
framework for financial instruments geared to sustainability. The 
Green Finance Framework systematically links our corporate ob-
jective of carbon neutrality by 2050 with our financing strategy. At 
the same time, we will be able to diversify our investor base and of-
fer existing investors further investment alternatives.
With the establishment of the Green Finance Framework, a new in-
ternal committee, the Green Finance Committee, was created. The 
committee is responsible for the selection process and the assess-
ment of appropriate sustainable projects. The Green Finance Frame-
work covers the following forms of financing: green bonds, green 
promissory note loans, green private placements and green loans.
19
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
In September 2020, the Volkswagen Group successfully placed its 
first green bonds with a volume of €2 billion on the market. The 
funds raised are specifically being used for refinancing projects re-
lating to the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) and the new ID.3 
and ID.4 electric vehicle models. These include investments and ex-
penses for conception, infrastructure, development and construc-
tion of the MEB itself and for the aforementioned electric vehicles 
based on it and their production plants, supplier tools and supplier 
systems, and key components, such as batteries.
For Volkswagen’s Green Finance Framework, the independent rat-
ing institution Sustainalytics provided a second party opinion to 
confirm compliance with the International Capital Market Associa-
tion (ICMA) Green Bond Principles and the Loan Market Associa-
tion (LMA) Green Loan Principles. The green bonds issued in 2020 
were certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). The Group will 
annually publish a report on the projects financed and their envi-
ronmental impact.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED
The Volkswagen Group wants to measure the impact of its actions 
even more precisely in quantitative terms in the future and, if pos-
sible and reasonable, to monetize this. It is about positive and nega-
tive impacts that the Group has in all sustainability dimensions 
with its business, supply chains and products and services. This 
means we are not only taking on board impetus from regulatory 
developments set in motion by the EU CSR Directive or the EU 
Green Bond Standard, but also impetus from international initia-
tives and organizations such as the OECD and the WBCSD. At the 
same time, like other global companies, we are endeavoring to 
make even greater use of an impact assessment in our decision- 
making and management processes, risk management, reporting 
and communication with our stakeholders.
We have been running two pilot projects under the name of “Im-
pact Valuation@VW Group” since 2019. At Volkswagen’s Kassel site, 
selected impacts on economic, environmental and social aspects 
were analyzed, monetized, quantified and summarized during the 
reporting year in a report on findings. The spectrum ranged from 
gross value added and jobs through decarbonization and biodiver-
sity to employee diversity and accident frequency. The aspects were 
also reviewed for any possible interdependence in order to take a 
holistic perspective and make the project’s findings usable for the 
site’s strategic alignment. The pilot project at Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche 
AG is also about identifying economic, social and environmental 
topics that allow impact to be measured. In the first step, selected 
sustainability indicators for the value chain from purchasing to 
our own business processes were taken into consideration.
Both projects will form an important foundation for intensified 
impact assessment in the entire Volkswagen Group in the future. 
This is backed by the active support of the Value Balancing Alliance 
(VBA). This initiative champions the development of uniform as-
sessment standards for impact measurement and the financial bal-
ancing of sustainability impacts on an international level across 
sectors. In addition to the Volkswagen Group, the VBA’s members 
include numerous global players, such as Bosch, BASF, BMW, SAP, 
Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings and Novartis.

STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
STRATEGIC STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
Our stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who 
have a material influence on or are materially influenced by the 
way in which the Group reaches its corporate decisions and the im-
plications of those decisions. We have identified ten stakeholder 
groups of equal value in our environment. Our customers and em-
ployees are at the center of our stakeholder network. Around this 
core, eight further groups were identified. The Group’s supervisory 
and advisory bodies, such as the Supervisory Board and the Works 
Council, and the Sustainability Council act as a special interface be-
tween internal and external stakeholders. The monitor appointed 
by the U.S. Department of Justice was also a key stakeholder of the 
Volkswagen Group until the end of his work in September 2020.
 
 Integrity and Compliance
GRI 102-42
For us, stakeholder management means interacting with key stake-
holder groups systematically, continuously and in line with our 
TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy. Stakeholder management aims 
to record expectations and use feedback from our stakeholders to 
critically reflect strategic planning processes. Our brands and re-
gions have their own stakeholder activities. The Group’s task is to 
bring together all of the activities in an integrated stakeholder ac-
tivity framework. 
This includes:
• Stakeholder activities on a Group level with specific committees, 
formats and a focus on stakeholders relevant across the Group
• Advising and coordinating the brands and regions and their 
activities
• Carrying out regular stakeholder analyses and stakeholder 
surveys

Efficient and internationally oriented stakeholder management is 
increasingly important for the Volkswagen Group. This is not only 
a foundation for determining the sustainability strategy’s key is-
sues but also for fulfilling the increasing requirements and com-
munication needs of our stakeholders, whose trust in the Volkswagen 
Group we want to continue to strengthen. We are pursuing the aim 
of open and transparent dialog with our stakeholders on the future 
issues of sustainability. This will be the basis for improving the 
Group’s reputation, acting flexibly and fast, and retaining our ac-
ceptance as a social actor even under changing conditions.
Our Group is a player in numerous networks of experts and deci-
sion-makers who have a significant influence on our business and 
the agenda in the politico-social environment. We want to inten-
sify our dialog with them. In the reporting year, we further opti-
mized stakeholder management and integrated it into relevant 
Group policies and management systems within the framework of 
the Best Governance module of the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strate-
gy. This also includes determining clear responsibilities for the re-
spective Group functions for relations with specific stakeholders of 
the Group.
REPUTATION KPI REFLECTS STAKEHOLDER TRUST
The reputation key performance indicator (KPI) makes a decisive 
contribution to anchoring stakeholder management in the strate-
gy. The indicator is based on the responses by external stakehold-
ers to the question in the annual Group reputation survey about 
the degree to which they trust the Volkswagen Group. The KPI af-
fords a holistic view of attitudes and opinions on the Group and al-
lows the identification of changes in evaluations over the course of 
time. 
We further honed the reputation survey in the reporting year. The 
Audi, Porsche, SEAT and Volkswagen brands are now represented 
throughout. The survey data is based on personal telephone inter-
views that are conducted annually with selected representatives 
from the fields of politics and associations, scientific bodies, NGOs, 
investors, analysts and business partners in the four markets (Ger-
many, the USA, China and Spain). The stakeholders to be surveyed 
are defined in a two-stage process: Volkswagen prioritizes organi-
zations and institutions to be contacted in order to represent the 
relevant stakeholders from the Group’s perspective. The market re-
search institution responsible chooses the remaining part regardless 
of any connection or business relationship with the Volkswagen 
Group in order to create a neutral sample. In principle, the highest 
possible level of the hierarchy is always surveyed within the organ-
izations and institutions contacted. The Group obtained the follow-
ing results in 2020: 57% of stakeholders in Germany stated that 
they trust the VW Group (2019: 34%). In the USA, the proportion 
was 78% (2019: 55%), in China 92% (2019: 93%) and in Spain 78% 
(Spain has only been surveyed since 2020).
Once a year, we produce a summary of our stakeholder feedback 
and the reaction of the Group in this regard. In the 2020 reporting 
year, our stakeholders submitted expectations to the Group across 
all committees and formats. These suggestions and remarks pro-
vide stimuli for further developing the Group strategy and sustain-
ability management. 
A summary is available on the Group’s corporate website.

STAKEHOLDER PANEL AS A CRITICAL COMPANION
In addition to the Sustainability Council, Volkswagen Group has es-
tablished a Stakeholder Panel, which has overseen the Group sus-
tainability activities for over 20 years. The aim is to critically ques-
tion and continuously improve sustainability management and 
the sustainability strategy. The members of the panel receive invi-
tations to dialog events and surveys at regular intervals and are our 
contacts for stakeholder analyses. The panel has more than 300 
participants in the German-speaking region (Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland). The start of the pandemic meant the panel’s work was 
paused in 2020, and the planned creation of an international panel 
was postponed to 2021.
DIALOG AND INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES
GRI 102-43
We also further developed our stakeholder dialog formats in this 
reporting year. The key events included the second Volkswagen 
Group Stakeholder Dialog in Wolfsburg in February 2020 as a con-
tinuation of the Group-wide dialog series started in the prior year. 
More than 150 participants, including stakeholders from NGOs, 
politics, academia, suppliers, investors and analysts as well as rep-
resentatives of the Group’s central Group and brand functions, dis-
cussed the social aspects of the transformation.
The topics discussed include issues of job security, training work-
ers, participation, and protection of human rights in a transparent 
supply chain. The choice of these topics underlines the fact that the 
transformation triggered by climate change and digitalization not 
only creates change in technologies, products and business models 
but also, particularly in the social field, an increased need for action.
The Volkswagen Group also continuously maintains close coopera-
tion with external partners and organizations.

REPRESENTATION OF INTERESTS TOWARDS POLITICS AND 
SOCIETY
GRI 415-1
The Volkswagen Group and its brands work in a complex and high-
ly regulated environment. We consider it our responsibility to ac-
tively participate in shaping the framework for our economic activ-
ity in dialog with our stakeholders.
On a Group level, the representation of the Group’s political inter-
ests towards governments, parliaments, authorities, associations, 
institutions and society is coordinated worldwide and a coordinat-
ed approach is taken in order to ensure coordinated action and 
consistent communication of the brands and companies. The “Pub-
lic Affairs” steering committee, which regularly reports to the 
Group’s Board of Management, is responsible for this.
Principles such as integrity, openness and verifiability and guide-
lines for contact with politicians as well as rules for transparency 
are set out in a Group-wide policy. For instance, Volkswagen AG’s 
entry in the European Union’s transparency register and the disclo-
sure of our positions represented to politicians in the reporting 
year – e.g. on the topics of decarbonization, digitalization or human 
rights – are based on these principles.
The policy commits the Group’s policymakers in associations to 
contribute the Group’s positions to discussions without change 
within the framework of what is permitted under competition and 
antitrust law. For others who carry out the tasks of representing po-
litical interests in associations, a training strategy was introduced 
in the reporting year.
The Group does not make political donations as a matter of princi-
ple. Where other forms of financial support are permitted and de-
sirable, we set rules for granting and disclosing this support, for ex-
ample for parties in the democratic spectrum in Germany in the 
context of sponsoring. Figures for the support of party events and 
for the advertising budget for party-affiliated publications are dis-
closed annually.
Our positions toward politicians, the policy on representing politi-
cal interests and further information on public affairs can be found

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a good corporate citizen, we would like to be a constant econom-
ic driver and contribute to structural development and equal op-
portunities in more (business) processes. We have always believed 
in the importance of recognizing our social responsibilities to-
wards our stakeholders. The main focus of our corporate social en-
gagement activities is on supporting future, educational and com-
munity projects at many of our sites across the world. We have not 
previously had a Group-wide corporate citizenship strategy but see 
this as necessary for reasons of transparency and manageability. 
That is why we are currently working on a strategic basis for this ac-
tion area. In 2020, the brands and companies supported more than 
700 projects and initiatives on a global scale.
Information on the individual topics and projects can be found on 
our website:
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting > CC-
Proj ects Worldwide
We select specific projects and develop them on our own or in part-
nership with local partner organizations and NGOs. We choose and 
carry out projects in accordance with our Group-wide guidelines:
• The projects are in line with the Group Essentials and address a 
specific issue of local relevance or a global challenge.
• They are an expression of diversity within the Group and the so-
cial environment in which the projects are carried out.
• They are the result of close dialog with the local stakeholders in-
volved in implementation.
• Projects are managed locally under the responsibility of the com-
petent units.
During the reporting year, we were involved in numerous projects 
to sustainably improve social structures. We give donations in cash 
and in kind to support activities and projects primarily devoted to 
education, culture, sports and social causes. Donations may only be 
given to recognized nonprofit organizations or ones specifically 
endorsed to receive donations. In the reporting period, Volkswagen 
AG made donations amounting to €42.2 million.
ASSISTANCE FOR HEALTHCARE IN THE PANDEMIC
Volkswagen has continued to provide support beyond the corpo-
rate environment during the coronavirus crisis: Volkswagen donat-
ed 7.9 million face masks as well as protective clothing, thermome-
ters and disinfectants to healthcare facilities at a cost of around 
€40 million and supported the German federal government by pro-
curing protective masks through the Group’s procurement chan-
nels. In addition, Volkswagen gave medically trained personnel 
paid leave to enable them to volunteer for work in public health ser-
vices. Together with Siemens, Volkswagen supports healthcare pro-
vision in the Moria refugee camp. Volkswagen continues to support 
the construction of a makeshift hospital in South Africa.
PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT ON SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Volkswagen Group increasingly links sustainability with digi-
talization in its social engagement activities, relying on partner-
ships to do so. For example, in 2020 we agreed a long-term collabo-
ration with Microsoft Germany to strengthen the companies’ 
social responsibility. The aim is to fund and jointly implement proj-
ects – for instance, in digital education and training. This is intend-
ed to give people access to digital technology, thus increasing par-
ticipation in society and future opportunities.
At the Autostadt Wolfsburg, the two cooperation partners are com-
prehensively expanding digital training options aimed at school 
students, young people and adults. Important societal issues such 
as digitalization and the mobility of the future are presented in a 
practical way and also in innovative formats here.
EMPLOYEES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
The work at the memorial site in Auschwitz has now been a fixed 
part of the Volkswagen Group’s lived culture of remembrance for 
more than 30 years. The joint project with the International 
Auschwitz Committee (IAC) is supported by employee representa-
tives and executive managers in equal measure. Trainees, manag-
ers, management trainees and foremen from Germany and Poland 
help maintain the memorial site in various programs there. This 
commitment promotes responsibility and imparts values such as 
tolerance and cultural openness. In September 2020, trainees and 
managers took part in a total of three projects on site.
The Volkswagen workforce has taken on social responsibility for 
people in need for decades: Volkswagen AG’s employees donated a 
total of €658,617.43 in 2020. Employees and the Group support dis-
advantaged people at the Volkswagen AG locations through these 
workforce donations. Support is given to specific projects, which, 
for example, improve the situation of people whose quality of life 
has been affected by illness, disability, or other circumstances. For 
example, the hospice foundation in Gifhorn was supported for an-
other phase of construction with a donation of €30,000. Moreover, 
small organizations are supported with purchases of IT equipment, 
office furniture or therapy equipment. Likewise, leisure activities 
can be realized with socially disadvantaged families for which no 
funds would otherwise be available. Likewise, on the initiative of 
and led by the Group Works Council, the Group’s employees have 
supported the international children’s relief organization terre des 
hommes for more than 20 years. In 2020, the amount donated was 
more than €1,188,600. At the Volkswagen Group’s production loca-
tions in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand 
and Germany, a wide variety of projects for disadvantaged children 
and young people are funded from the donations. They are given 
protection, support, the opportunity for education and career 
prospects.

S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
For the first time in the cooperation between the Group Works 
Council and the children’s relief organization terre des hommes, a 
joint call for donations for coronavirus emergency aid was made 
this year with the Group Board of Management. €693,581 was 
raised, showing great solidarity and extremely high willingness to 
donate – especially during the coronavirus crisis.
For example, it was possible to extensively support the Otomi peo-
ple in Mexico. Employees of the project partner Postgrado en Cien-
cias del Desarrollo CIDES provided education about the consequences 
of COVID-19. They also distributed food packages and vitamin prod-
ucts. Moreover, the aid workers raised parents’ awareness regard-
ing keeping a closer eye on symptoms of illness in their children 
and making use of medical help if necessary. A doctor, who the 
families can consult free of charge, was funded with the aid money 
from the coronavirus emergency aid. 
In South Africa, employee donations have supported the Ubuntu 
Pathways organization for more than eleven years. This meant aid 
workers were able to implement numerous health measures locally 
for children, young people and their families in the township of 
Zwide in Port Elizabeth, where more than 400,000 people live. 
When the coronavirus pandemic started, Ubuntu Pathways trans-
formed its head office in the township into a crisis management 
center. The people at most risk from COVID-19 are given immediate 
medical assistance there. This includes HIV treatment and medica-
tion supply for a total of 2,000 immunocompromised children and 
their families.
The donation of the cents after the decimal point in employees’ 
payslips also supplemented the long-term financing of projects at 
Group locations around the world.
SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES
The Volkswagen Group takes responsibility for refugees and the hu-
manitarian consequences of global migration. We therefore set up 
the Volkswagen Group’s refugee aid program, a unit that coordi-
nates cross-brand projects, initiates and implements measures and 
forms networks with other active companies, trade associations 
and relief organizations.
Since 2015, we have thus created a large number of site-specific op-
tions for refugees in cooperation with the people responsible for 
sustainability of the Group brands. There were three areas of focus 
here: meeting, education and professional integration. In order to 
raise awareness regarding refugees and migration, all trainees vis-
ited a multimedia, mobile exhibition in their first year of appren-
ticeship. In the area of school education, our focus in the reporting 
year was on comprehensive career-related language acquisition be-
cause this is the key to additional career prospects for refugees in 
Germany. We also offered language courses lasting a number of 
months and have sponsored integration and vocational skills 
courses to obtain a high school diploma.
We have implemented career guidance and skills assessment mea-
sures at various Group sites. Our entry-level vocational qualification 
options, which combine theoretical and practical preparation for a 
career and an intensive language course and thus prepare refugees 
for an apprenticeship in Germany, were just as successful. There 
were also specialist internships for recognizing professional quali-
fications gained abroad. This moves refugees from the status of an 
assistant to that of a recognized specialist employee and means 
they have better labor market prospects. Apprenticeship options 
for refugees rounded off the offering.
In addition to the Group-wide involvement of the Audi, Porsche, 
MAN, Volkswagen Financial Services, Volkswagen Commercial Ve-
hicles and Volkswagen Passenger Cars brands, many employees of 
the Volkswagen Group do voluntary work for refugees. Supporting 
them in this is also the Volkswagen Group’s refugee aid program’s 
task. From 2015 until the end of 2020, we reached more than 5,500 
refugees through our projects.
In view of the state of emergency in the Mediterranean region, in 
2020 we expanded our efforts for refugees beyond Germany. For 
example, the Volkswagen Group donated €3.5 million in emergen-
cy aid for people threatened by the coronavirus pandemic in refu-
gee camps in Syria, Turkey and Greece. The funds were given to the 
German Red Cross, which organizes and implements the aid locally 
with the national organizations of the Red Cross and the Red Cres-
cent. The donations were used for the procurement, transport and 
distribution of aid supplies and food and for medical and psychoso-
cial emergency aid. The Volkswagen Group made a further dona-
tion of €5 million together with Siemens AG as humanitarian 
emergency aid for refugees in the Greek refugee camp in Moria on 
Lesbos. After the major fire there, the situation of the people there 
dramatically escalated. The funds also went to the German Red 
Cross and national partner organizations.

DIGITALIZATION
With digitalization, we want to become a business that shapes the 
change and are working at full speed to advance its development – 
not just in our vehicles and mobility services but also in manufac-
turing, in sales and in other administrative and technical process-
es. The plan is that all new vehicle models across the Group will be 
built on an in-house software platform by 2025. It has the potential 
to set standards in the industry. Furthermore, we will additionally 
invest €4 billion in developing our IT by 2023. We are thus on the 
way to establishing ourselves as a software-driven mobility 
company.
DIGITALIZATION AS AN ENABLER OF THE GROUP’S 
TRANSFORMATION
For us, digitalization is not just an engine for tapping important fu-
ture potential at the product level. It also permeates all the Group’s 
activities for implementing our sustainability strategy and thus 
works as an important enabler for achieving our ambitions and ob-
jectives in four focus areas and for the transformation of the Group. 
Digitalization is also connected with a number of challenges for the 
Volkswagen Group. For example, jobs previously involving manual 
work are going to disappear as a result of greater penetration of IT 
in manufacturing. On the other hand, we will need numerous new 
employees with digital skills, whose recruitment is made harder 
due to a significant IT skills shortage in the labor market. With 
modern recruitment processes, extensive training programs and 
the Digital Transformation Roadmap launched in 2019, we have set 
the direction in terms of HR policy in a way that meets changed 
requirements.
 
 Workforce Transformation
The use of digital processes in products and manufacturing in turn 
relies on the exchange of large quantities of data. This requires effi-
cient infrastructure and compliance with strict regulations that 
encompass a high level of IT security and the protection of custom-
er, partner and employee data.
STRATEGIC REORIENTATION OF GROUP IT
Volkswagen Group IT manages IT processes and projects Group-
wide across brands and regions, thus advancing digitalization. Or-
ganizationally, it is allocated to the Finance & IT operating unit and 
works closely with the IT units in the respective brand organiza-
tions. In the reporting year, Group IT thoroughly updated its strate-
gic guidelines for the period until 2023. The creation of a clear dis-
tribution of tasks and competences on a global scale, the strategic 
advancement of digitalization in partnership with all the business 
areas and the establishment of universal platforms for achieving 
synergies and a high process speed are of key importance. To this 
end, we continuously modernize our IT systems, increase their 
efficiency and integrate systems and applications in new cloud 
platforms. We focus on digital key technologies such as artificial in-
telligence and the use of new IT technologies and products, services 
and corporate processes.
On an operating level, the Group IT Steering Committee has the 
task of creating synergies, managing the Group IT project portfolio 
and encouraging communication with departments on IT projects. 
Planning and managing the IT project portfolio at Group level will 
ensure the coordinated use of budgets and resources in the devel-
opment, implementation and use of IT solutions. For digitalization 
in the Group, we also use our in-house IT labs, which act as centers 
of innovation and excellence. Group IT, research institutions, tech-
nology partners and policymakers are working closely together 
there on future trends in information technology. At the same 
time, the labs function as liaison offices for start-ups. In software 
development centers (SDC) we develop cross-brand software for 
digital ecosystems and for new business processes in the Group. We 
thereby maintain in-house expertise in the rapid, demand-orient-
ed development of software and IT solutions. 
RESPONSIBLE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial intelligence is increasingly gaining industrial relevance 
for the Volkswagen Group and is already a competitive factor. The 
Group has therefore already created the conditions to be able to de-
velop and use powerful AI systems itself at an early stage. For ex-
ample, around 110 Group IT experts work in Munich and Wolfs-
burg on research and development for applications of machine 
learning and data analytics. The potential of quantum computers 
for commercially viable areas of application is also being tapped. In 
the reporting year, this included projects for optimizing material 
design for the batteries used in electric vehicles, navigation sys-
tems for fleets of coaches, improved traffic planning and logistics 
processes and new training and learning methods.
Artificial intelligence is relevant for the Volkswagen Group in two 
major subject areas: in the vehicle and in business processes. The 
key is AI for autonomous driving that is based on the use of 
self-learning algorithms for environment and environmental rec-
ognition and for intelligent voice control, for example for naviga-
tion and convenience functions. In the Group itself, “cognitive er-
gonomics” is particularly important. This is what we call the use of 
self-learning algorithms that remove repetitive administrative 
work from employees and can prepare for the final decision. Other 
important application areas include enabling intelligent robots to 
work hand-in-hand with human specialist workers and predictive 
maintenance in manufacturing. 
GRI 203-1, 203-2, 416-2

In close cooperation with the other Group IT labs, the machine 
learning research lab in Munich works on basic research for ma-
chine learning for Volkswagen in order to develop and test new 
methods. The aim is to use probabilistic approaches to develop and 
test methods that combine unsupervised learning, time series 
modeling, prior knowledge and optimum regulatory methods: the 
foundation of artificial general intelligence.
But we never forget the societal risks of using AI. We have therefore 
established an international consortium of industrial and universi-
ty partners that develops and tests measurable criteria in coopera-
tion with bodies at European level in order to use AI safely and 
transparently in products and processes.
INDUSTRIAL CLOUD: DIGITALIZATION IN PRODUCTION
The Volkswagen Group also consistently focuses on digital technol-
ogies of the future in production and is advancing the integration 
of its factories into the Industrial Cloud. One important aim is to 
further increase the plants’ efficiency and cut production costs. 
Following the connection of the first three plants in 2019, it was 
possible to integrate a further 16 production locations of the Audi, 
SEAT, ŠKODA, Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial 
Vehicles and Porsche brands and of their components into the data 
cloud in 2020. 
The “Industrial Computer Vision” image recognition and process-
ing technology is one of the particularly innovative, efficiency-in-
creasing digitalization applications in manufacturing. The process 
extracts information from optical data – for instance, the physical 
environment in the plant – and assesses this with the aid of artifi-
cial intelligence. This resembles the human ability to capture, pro-
cess and analyze images. The application facilitates, for example, 
quality control and vehicle identification with country-specific in-
formation and language variants. In the reporting year, Porsche 
and Audi prepared two initial computer vision solutions for Group-
wide rollout and connection to the Industrial Cloud. 
Together with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and our integration 
partner Siemens, we are also opening up the Industrial Cloud for 
more companies with activities in mechanical engineering and 
technology. New partners can connect with the Volkswagen sites in 
the future and contribute their own software applications for opti-
mizing manufacturing processes in the Industrial Cloud. This will 
result in a rapidly growing supply of industrial software applica-
tions for Volkswagen’s factories. Every site should obtain applica-
tions for its machines, tools and systems directly from the Indus-
trial Cloud and therefore be able to produce even more efficiently. 
Eleven international pioneering partners are involved right from 
the start: ABB, ASCon Systems, BearingPoint, Celonis, Dürr, GROB-
WERKE, MHP, NavVis, SYNAOS, Teradata and WAGO.
In the future, the Industrial Cloud is intended to include all 
Volkswagen’s factories around the world and the entire supply 
chain and will simplify the exchange of data across systems and 
plants. This is based on AWS technologies in the areas of the Inter-
net of Things (IoT), machine learning, data analytics and computing 
services, which have been extended to the specific requirements of 
Volkswagen and the automotive sector.
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW GROUP UNIT CAR.SOFTWARE 
ORGANIZATION 
In the software-driven mobility company module, we are working 
to make software development one of the Volkswagen Group’s core 
competencies. To this end, we are pooling our existing expertise 
and enormously strengthening our workforce. Since January 1, 
2020, we have pooled all our equity investments and subsidiaries 
that develop software for vehicles and for digital ecosystems in the 
Car.Software organization (CSO) – an independent company with 
Group responsibility. We plan to introduce the new uniform soft-
ware platform with the full range of functions offered by the 
VW.OS operating system developed by the Car.Software organiza-
tion for the first time in a flagship model from Audi in 2024. The 
vehicle will be created in the new agile “Artemis” unit, which 
should enormously accelerate the development process in close co-
operation with the Car.Software organization. This agile project is 
intended to establish a closer connection with customers beyond 
the entire product life cycle. This approach will enable us to lever-
age synergies between the individual brands and vehicle projects. 
The aim is that the Volkswagen Group and its brands will stand not 
solely for high vehicle quality but in equal measure for exciting 
digital products and services.
In addition, the Car.Software organization will bundle the techno-
logical platform solutions for data-driven business models and in-
novations in the Group in the future. High investment by 2025 is 
budgeted for this size of task. It is decentralized in order to be close 
to the brands and markets and also present at attractive locations 
for software developers. Site locations include Ingolstadt, Wolfs-
burg, Stuttgart, Berlin and Munich. It also has sites in Europe, Chi-
na, the USA, Israel and India.
The Car.Software organization evolved in leaps and bounds in 2020. 
The organization was launched with around 2,000 employees from 
the Volkswagen, Porsche and Audi brands plus new Car.Software 
organization employees. By the end of the year, the Car.Software 
organization was strengthened with 500 additional IT experts and 
has its sights on the 5,000 employee mark in 2021 with the integra-
tion of equity investments. 
The boards of management of the Group and the Car.Software or-
ganization were restructured in July 2020. Markus Duesmann took 
charge of software development in the Volkswagen Group Board of 
Management within the scope of his responsibility for research 
27
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
and development and is also the Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board of the Car.Software organization in this role. Dirk Hilgen-
berg, an established IT and transformation specialist, became the 
CEO of the Car.Software organization and leads the board of man-
agement team with CHRO, CFO and CTO. The aim is to continuously 
develop the Car.Software organization on the basis of five target ar-
eas – product, processes, people, structures and enterprise – and by 
means of agile work methods. A separate unit that will manage the 
topic of corporate social responsibility is planned.
 
 Strategy and Management
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION 
SECURITY
In connection with the entry into force of the EU-wide General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), measures aimed at compliance with 
data protection requirements have been developed and implemented 
at Volkswagen. For example, numerous lawyers from Group Legal 
Affairs and Group data protection officers together with specialists 
from Group IT and data protection coordinators in the depart-
ments work closely together to meet the high requirements regard-
ing data protection. In addition to establishing a sustainable data 
protection organization, a stringent data protection management 
system was developed and systematically expanded with the aim 
of achieving the required process security.
In addition, awareness of the privacy-related topic of data protec-
tion was raised in the Volkswagen Group in order, in particular, to 
support the success of the digitalization projects. The principle of 
checks and balances established in the Group with the distribution 
of various roles and rights in the context of processing processes 
relevant to data protection is also an essential prerequisite of re-
flective and responsible implementation of the tasks at a high level.
We particularly focus on maintaining information security and de-
fending against cyber attacks. The Group Information Security 
Steering Committee (GISSC), which consists of the chief informa-
tion security officers of the Group, the brands and the regions and 
representatives of Group Internal Audit, has overarching responsi-
bility. It is supported in its operational work by the Group Informa-
tion Security department.
The governance processes of the information security manage-
ment system are certified in accordance with the internationally 
recognized ISO 27001 standard. Local and Group-wide TOP security 
incidents are reported to the GISSC once a quarter. The total num-
ber of all incidents detected is summarized in the annual informa-
tion security report the Board of Management receives. Where 
damage is discovered, e.g. data loss or business interruptions, the 
Volkswagen Group’s cybersecurity insurance comes into play.
In the Group’s individual brands and regions, security operations 
centers (SOCs) were also established as separate units with IT secu-
rity experts. These become active in the event of IT security inci-
dents, for example, in the event of hacker attacks or the discovery 
of vulnerabilities in systems. The team also functions as a coordi-
nating body and works on preventive measures to avoid IT security 
incidents. 
The employees responsible can refer to regulations and guidelines 
for action that serve them as guidance and support in handling se-
rious and business-critical IT security incidents in compliance with 
the rules. The aim is to restore the disrupted IT service as quickly as 
possible. Group Information Security runs penetration tests on be-
half of the brands to identify and counteract vulnerabilities at an 
early stage – these tests are an integral component of the assess-
ment of information security in the Group. In addition, Group In-
formation Security offers and conducts various trainings and lec-
tures on information and cybersecurity.
STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE AND DIGITALLY CONNECTED 
MOBILITY
We offer both innovative vehicle technologies and forward-looking 
mobility services, with which we want to meet our customers’ re-
quirements, but can also help to solve local environmental and 
traffic problems in urban and rural areas and to protect the climate 
worldwide. The global cooperation with partners outside the Group 
plays an important role. We are guided here by the “Shaping mobil-
ity – for generations to come” vision underlying our TOGETHER 
2025+ Group strategy. We have bundled our ambitions in our four 
mobility pledges and embedded them centrally in the sus tain abil-
ity narrative developed in the course of the materiality analysis.
 
  Strategy and Management > Sustainability and Materiality
CHANGED MOBILITY REQUIREMENTS AS A FRAMEWORK FOR 
ACTION
Our global society today faces the major challenge of finding the 
right balance when shaping mobility. Both overloading and deficits 
exist concurrently: the limits for noise, traffic jams, accidents, 
parking space or poor air quality have been reached or exceeded in 
many major cities. At the same time, there are too few means of 
transportation for many people or the transport is too expensive 
for them, limiting people’s access to and participation in society. 
This is not only the case in the less developed countries around the 
world, but also in rural areas of industrialized countries and in 
suburbs.
New solutions must satisfy a large number of social requirements. 
It is important for companies to aim for transparency with regard 
28
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
to the impact of their mobility offerings and also to evaluate these 
at an early stage. Conflicting objectives and undesirable side effects 
must be identified and addressed. Weighting the objectives, by con-
trast, is a task that can only be solved in constant dialog with socie-
ty and politicians. 
As an automotive manufacturer, we traditionally rely on infra-
structure such as roads, gas stations, charging stations or parking 
spaces and on their providers. On our path to becoming a mobility 
provider with new solutions, the need for connection with other 
players and for cooperation continues to increase. Traffic-efficient 
driving, for example, only works in the coordinated interaction be-
tween vehicle and traffic lights or roadworks. Mobility services 
need “stops” to let passengers in and out. Car sharing services need 
reliable parking spaces. Integration into the structure of public 
transport services or connection with other private mobility ser-
vices must also be taken into account here. On the way to new mo-
bility concepts, various opportunities for and approaches to coop-
eration thus present themselves. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on user behav-
ior and the provision of services in 2020. It should be noted that, 
firstly, the importance of means of transport that function in a sta-
ble way for the transportation of people and goods that are system-
ically important has become apparent. Secondly, the type of use of 
the means of transport has had to be adapted to avoid spreading 
the virus. The need for social distancing has especially hit public 
transport and mobility services, whose efficiency is based on pas-
senger density. Public transport has had to deal with a steep decline 
in use due to increased infection risks and strict hygiene require-
ments. Ride hailing and other shared mobility formats have also 
declined, including because providers had ceased operations. By 
contrast, COVID-19 has increased the appeal of individual mobility – 
both with motorized vehicles and nonmotorized bicycles. During 
the pandemic, many major cities began to change their road traffic 
infrastructure in the short term to provide more room for bicycles 
and pedestrians, which should make complying with social dis-
tancing requirements easier in comparison with public transport. 
The Volkswagen Group continuously analyzes evolving challenges 
and trends in order to draw conclusions for our own business mod-
els and the services we offer.
URBAN MOBILITY IN THE FOCUS OF INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION PROJECTS
Shaping urban mobility plays a key role for the Volkswagen Group 
because many mobility options are primarily available in cities. 
According to the UN’s estimates, almost 70% of the global popula-
tion will live in cities by 2050. The problems are the most urgent 
and at the same time the potential for change is the greatest here. 
As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Devel-
opment (WBCSD) for many years, we seek a dialog with other 
transformative companies and stakeholders in order to identify 
our own scope for action. 
In the reporting year, the Volkswagen Group continued its collabo-
ration on the WBSCD’s Transforming Urban Mobility (TUM) proj-
ect. In addition to decarbonization, a particular focus was the topic 
of mobility as a service (MaaS). In 2020, the WBCSD agreed a coop-
eration with the International Transport Forum (ITF) for preparing 
an analysis of the trends, criteria and design recommendations in 
the new mobility landscape. The ITF is the leading global body for 
dialog on transport policy and, as an intergovernmental organiza-
tion with 60 member states, organizes the largest annual summit 
of transport ministers. The focus of the analysis in the field of MaaS 
is preparing policy recommendations for realizing sustainable mo-
bility in cities. The project, which the Volkswagen Group is also in-
volved in, underlines the importance of cross-sectoral dialog on 
connected, automated, shared and electric mobility. It is intended 
to help companies, associations and policymakers alike find routes 
to sustainability based on objective criteria in the changing mobili-
ty system and to support the development of innovative business 
models and strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major 
influence on this project, because it suddenly exposed the vulnera-
bility of the transport system and thus the importance of the crite-
rion regarding the resilience of transport and traffic: supplying so-
ciety’s basic needs of food, healthcare services and much more 
requires failsafe transport services for people and goods. People 
must also be able to travel by all means of transport without risk of 
infection. 
WORLDWIDE CITY PARTNERSHIPS 
The Volkswagen Group sees itself as a close and reliable partner to 
cities. A wide variety of projects is already being developed, tested 
and implemented in numerous collaborations around the world. 
The priority is the establishment of new technologies intended to 
reduce congestion and environmental pollution. Currently, our 
Group has initiated partnerships with numerous cities. These in-
clude Hamburg, Hanover, Dresden and Wolfsburg in Germany and 
cities such as Prague and Barcelona internationally.
Together with the city of Hanover, Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles manages and coordinates the urban logistics initiative. The 
goal is to realize clean, quiet, efficient and thus future-proof logis-
tics concepts for cities. In 2020, the national funded projects USE-
fUL (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) and 
ZUKUNFT.DE (German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital 
Infrastructure) were completed together with industrial and aca-
demic partners. Practical research findings on planning innovative 
logistics concepts in cities were produced, and it was shown that lo-
cally emission-free package delivery with light commercial vehi-
cles is already practicable and expedient. Parcel delivery providers 
are testing emission-free package delivery with eCrafters and Cargo 
e-bikes in a pilot project in the Linden Nord district of Hanover.
29
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
Promoting electric mobility, innovative mobility services, the in-
telligent connection of transport and the use of self-driving vehi-
cles are at the heart of the partnership with Hamburg. In 2019, the 
ride-pooling service MOIA was launched in all-electric operating 
mode in Hamburg. The launch of the all-electric car sharing service 
WeShare planned for 2020 could not be carried out in the Hanseatic 
city due to the pandemic and is now planned for 2021. The Intelli-
gent Transport Systems (ITS) World Congress, which Hamburg is 
organizing in 2021, will be another milestone of the collaboration 
between Hamburg and the Volkswagen Group. 
Under the “mobility of the future” mission statement, we advanced 
our collaboration with Dresden, the capital city of Saxony, in the ar-
eas of electric mobility, charging infrastructure and connected 
driving. Volkswagen opened its Gläserne Manufaktur, where visi-
tors and customers can experience technologies of the future up 
close, in 2012. With the functional testing station, Volkswagen has 
brought a new research and development entity to Dresden, which 
focuses on testing driver assistance systems. Furthermore, innova-
tive projects in mobility, industry, logistics and sustainability have 
been nurtured in the start-up incubator since 2017.
MOBILITY SOLUTIONS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The complexity of the mobility system means it is not easy to pre-
dict whether new concepts will make a contribution to achieving 
sustainability goals and what underlying conditions need to exist 
for this. Volkswagen addresses this challenge with an impact as-
sessment that digitally replicates mobility on the basis of real data. 
Political players or cities increasingly require the earliest possible 
proof that mobility solutions also have sustainability effects, and 
this proof can become a component of approvals or long-term 
operation. 
Various KPIs that are not only scientifically acknowledged but also 
reflect the requirements of various players are used in the evalua-
tion: for example, short journey times are important for custom-
ers, the reduction of CO2 emissions is important for society, cities 
want to occupy as little space as possible with traffic and improve 
air quality, and good utilization of its services is important for the 
operator. The use of simulations means possible improvements – 
and also any undesirable side effects – can be discovered early.
Measures for increasing efficiency in road traffic continue to be im-
portant steps on the path to sustainable mobility for Volkswagen. 
Ride-pooling and urban traffic-light intersections remain focus 
topics for the impact assessment here. Pooling journeys – in public 
and in individual transport – is a key success factor for sus tain abil-
ity in transport. Mobility services face the additional challenge of 
keeping empty trips before or after transporting customers or relo-
calizations of rental vehicles to a minimum. The displacement of a 
private single journey to a commercial single journey by the same 
means of transport (e.g. ride hailing or car sharing instead of a pri-
vate car) only has potential to improve the situation in parking and 
not in traffic. However, pooling like in the MOIA example means 
linking the transport needs of various customers as optimally as 
possible in order to balance detours and waiting times with capaci-
ty as well as possible. Modeling and impact assessment provide val-
uable services here in order to represent the high level of complexi-
ty. The methods and model approaches for mobility simulation are 
continuously adapted to the current state of research and science 
and further developed, in both cases in collaboration with univer-
sities. Moreover, real data and empirical figures from mobility pro-
viders are used for continuous improvement. 
We have also further developed our impact assessment of urban 
traffic-light intersections, which represent a bottleneck in traffic 
capacity and quality in towns and cities. Optimum use of this traf-
fic capacity potential will reduce the need for space for traffic in 
towns and cities. A vehicle approaching the traffic-light intersec-
tion can, for example, avoid the time- and energy-inefficient 
maneuvers of braking and starting the vehicle if it is informed 
when the traffic light will go green in advance. This reduces the 
consumption of fuel or energy and improves the flow of traffic.
In addition to these approaches to improving the individual vehi-
cle, cooperative driving maneuvers with other vehicles due to in-
creasing vehicle networking are becoming increasingly interesting – 
for example, a coordinated convoy start at the traffic light. If 
self-driving vehicles join the complex traffic at intersections in the 
future, certain effects should be expected. For example, an auto-
matically driven vehicle must initially be enabled to drive in a traf-
fic-efficient way based on its sensors and actuators by means of in-
telligent algorithms. This is particularly challenging in mixed 
traffic with other, non-automatic vehicles and pedestrians, cyclists 
or buses. Intelligent transport infrastructure, particularly the traf-
fic lights, will ideally support this by providing vehicles with the 
necessary information. Key interactions are investigated in various 
scenarios of the impact assessment. Initial assessment findings 
show considerable potential for increasing capacity and reducing 
fuel consumption. Corresponding requirements for the develop-
ment of automatic vehicles and traffic assistance systems are de-
rived from this.

DIGITALLY CONNECTED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
In a time of rapid societal progress in the field of digitalization, we 
have set ourselves the objective of playing a leading role in the pro-
vision of intelligent, customer-focused and sustainable products 
and services. We want to put society and customers’ requirements 
for the digitally connected mobility of the future into practice to-
day with our services. At the same time, we want to make mobility 
cleaner, safer and accessible for everyone by advancing autono-
mous driving. 
VOLKSWAGEN WE AS A DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM
“Volkswagen We” is a growing range of vehicle-related digital ser-
vices and mobility solutions that can be used in the car or with a 
smartphone. The associated building blocks of We Connect and We 
Charge, among other things, enable our customers to plan routes 
efficiently in real time and give them effortless access to charging 
infrastructure. 
We Connect connects users with their vehicle and enables many 
helpful features, such as unlocking and locking via the app or send-
ing a digital key to another user of the vehicle. With We Charge, the 
customer benefits from the contracts with the operators of affiliat-
ed charging stations, central billing and simple management of 
tariffs, charging cards and wall boxes. Charging stations are easy to 
find using the app, as is real-time information, such as whether 
charging points are occupied. This motivates our customers to 
charge their environmentally friendly vehicles with green energy. 
Volkswagen offers 100% electric car sharing in the city of Berlin 
with WeShare. This not only saves space in towns and cities but is 
also efficient for most users because customers only turn to their 
cars when they really need them.
Moreover, Volkswagen offers its business customers with small to 
medium-sized fleets an efficient fleet management system with 
We Connect-Fleet. The We Connect-Fleet analysis can quickly record 
and compare individual vehicles’ long-term consumption. The 
“driving efficiency” service available as part of this system also 
helps to clearly assess the economic use of vehicles in operation 
and thus optimize the use of the fleet.
SHARED MOBILITY WITH WESHARE 
With WeShare, we want to participate in the still growing car- sharing 
market in Germany and at the same time shoulder environmental 
responsibility. With 1,500 e-Golf vehicles, the Volkswagen brand 
has put an all-electric fleet on the road in Berlin, all of which is 
powered by certified green energy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
WeShare benefited from changed mobility behavior among users 
and was able to steadily increase the number of customers and 
journeys by the end of the reporting year. The expansion of the 
fleet by a further 500 e-up!s, which was already planned for 2020, 
and the use of ID.3-models had to be canceled or postponed be-
cause of the pandemic. At the end of the year, WeShare was, howev-
er, able to add the first 58 ID.3 vehicles to the Berlin fleet. In addi-
tion to gradually replacing the e-Golf fleet with an ID.3 fleet in 
Berlin, an expansion of the WeShare program into other cities is also 
planned for 2021. 
In Berlin, WeShare adds free-floating car sharing to the diverse 
range of mobility services. The service makes it possible for the ma-
jority of the people of Berlin to rely on their own vehicle to a lesser 
extent and nevertheless remain mobile at all times. Users are also 
introduced to e-mobility and get to know its benefits. The offering 
also features a large area of business and high density of vehicles, 
meaning that users have a short distance to the vehicle. Local part-
nerships with private companies such as the Schwarz Group (LIDL 
and Kaufland) have been concluded in order to use the existing 
charging infrastructure.
MOIA: SHARED USE OF TRANSPORT SERVICES
Shared journeys ease congestion and environmental pollution in 
urban areas. MOIA offers shared on-demand mobility services 
(ride-pooling) in Germany. Instead of using their own cars, people 
travel to their destination with other passengers all traveling in the 
same direction. With its ride-pooling service, MOIA complements 
existing public rail and bus routes in a practical, inexpensive man-
ner and offers an attractive alternative to private cars. In addition 
to the number of users, the shared journeys are the relevant bench-
mark for us for measuring impact here. In the reporting year, the 
users of MOIA completed a total of 1,879,070 journeys.
MOIA launched regular operations in Hanover in 2018 and in 
Hamburg in 2019. In the reporting year, MOIA had more than 330 
(2019: 100) all-electric vehicles on the road in Hamburg and around 
50 in Hanover. The vehicle fleet is charged with 100% certified 
green energy. Hamburg is a global flagship project for MOIA. It is 
the first city with a population of more than a million where we 
have put our offering for innovative, shared mobility on the road. 
MOIA sees itself as part of the inner-city mobility offering and as a 
meaningful addition to local public transport. The Group is cooper-
ating with Hamburg and the public transport operator Hamburger 
Hochbahn. For example, in June 2020 MOIA became the first mo-
bility service provider to be integrated in Hamburger Verkehrsver-
bund’s hvv switch app. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles also 
joined the MaaS Alliance through MOIA. The MaaS Alliance is a 
public-private partnership organization that has set itself the objec-
tive of creating an open platform for implementing MaaS projects.
In addition to its own charging infrastructure in its own depots, 
MOIA will also use B2B partners’ charging infrastructure in the fu-
ture. The first cooperation with Vattenfall was agreed in August 
2020. In September 2020, the third MOIA depot was opened in 
Wandsbek and is thus an important milestone in establishing 
MOIA in Hamburg.

EXPANSION OF MICROMOBILITY
In addition to valuable collaboration in partnerships, the Volkswagen 
Group already offers cities a large number of solutions especially 
for the urban area – for example e-micromobility vehicles both for 
transporting people and for transporting goods. SEAT, for instance, 
unites all the Group’s product-, service- and platform-based mobili-
ty solutions under one roof with its own Urban Mobility business 
unit. The company plays the role of a center of competence for mi-
cromobility for the Volkswagen Group and underlines this with a 
broad range of products, including the e-roller and the SEAT MÓ 
e-kick scooter, use of which is also offered as a sharing service. In 
Prague, ŠKODA operates BeRider, an innovative and emission-free 
sharing service with electric rollers. ŠKODA also operates the City-
Move platform in Prague, which links the various private mobility 
services with public transport and other services such as parking. 
We use the number of registered customers and kilometers trav eled 
as sustainability KPIs for our progress in shared micromobility for 
BeRider and SEAT MÓ. In the reporting year, 23,478 users were reg-
istered with BeRider, and they traveled a total of 798,000 kilo meters 
with the vehicles; the SEAT MÓ app was downloaded 38,000 times. 
For CityMove, in addition to the number of customers, we also assess 
the number of business transactions. In the reporting year, 49,125 
users were registered with CityMove, and they were responsible 
for a total of 175,947 transactions.
NEW CONCEPTS FOR EMPLOYEE MOBILITY
The Volkswagen Group will also provide solutions for sustainable 
employee mobility with We Move, ŠKODA Click and Respiro in the 
future. We Move will, for example, be part of the new comprehen-
sive “Volkswagen Move by Service Factory” mobility initiative at 
the Wolfsburg site. In a first step, up to 35,000 employees will be 
able to digitally access a fleet of 315 vehicles for business use here. 
This service will permanently change business mobility at 
Volkswagen and replace the use of conventional department vehicles. 
AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IS BECOMING REALITY
Autonomous driving is a key issue in our transformation from a 
traditional automotive manufacturer to a provider of sustainable 
mobility. A concept based on heavily used autonomous vehicles 
will not only require less space and energy in the future – it will also 
be much safer. We would like to make automated driving accessible 
to everyone, everywhere.
We are already starting series production of partly automated driv-
er assistance systems. For example, the Travel Assist, which assists 
with longitudinal and latitudinal guidance so that the driver can 
drive more comfortably and also more safely. Innovative parking 
features also make day-to-day urban life easier. Certain features 
can even help to save lives in critical situations – for example, our 
Emergency Assist, which, as a “rescue assistant”, can stop the vehi-
cle and make an automatic emergency call if driver activity ceases, 
particularly if there is a medical emergency.
Volkswagen Autonomy GmbH (VWAT) was founded in 2019 as a 
center of competence for autonomous driving based in Wolfsburg 
and Munich in order to develop the technology to market readi-
ness. More sites in North America and China were planned for the 
next few years. When the decision was made to invest with Ford in 
Argo AI, a company that is working on the development of a system 
for autonomous driving, responsibility for Mobility-as-a-Service 
(MaaS), Transport-as-a-Service (TaaS) and the autonomous driving 
needed for this was transferred to Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles at the end of 2020. The joint investment check allows both Ford 
and Volkswagen to independently integrate Argo AI’s self-driving 
system into their own vehicles and business models and particu-
larly opens up new possibilities for ride-sharing providers and de-
livery services in urban areas. The former Volkswagen Group com-
pany AID was also contributed to ARGO AI when Volkswagen 
acquired its stake.
For the area of ownership and own use of vehicles, the activities for 
developing assisted and automated features for all the Volkswagen 
Group’s brands were pooled in the Car.Software organization (CSO) 
in 2020. The aim is to be able to offer the customer a custom mobil-
ity solution for every need. Especially in the area of ownership, the 
Group is focusing on evolutionary development of the level of auto-
mation. Two major objectives are being pursued: increasingly re-
lieving the customer of the task of driving with a continuous series 
of new solutions and, building on this, giving the customer the op-
tion of doing other things on selected journeys or sections of 
routes with an automated “chauffeur.”
The Volkswagen Group continues to work with partners on future 
technical challenges – from algorithms through sensor technology 
to cybersecurity. In strategic core fields, we at the same time con-
tinue to expand our own software expertise and are intensifying 
value creation. The acquisition of Hella GmbH & Co. KGaA’s image 
processing business area by the Car.Software organization (CSO) to 
strengthen the field of image processing was announced in Octo-
ber 2020. Good and valid environment recognition is one of the 
most important core competences for all automated driving 
functions.

INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE
HOLISTIC INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
We are convinced that behaving with integrity and in compliance 
with the rules is of key importance for our Group’s future success 
as a provider of sustainable mobility. We have therefore made in-
tegrity and compliance a central pillar of our TOGETHER 2025+ 
Group strategy. Our objective is to act as a role model for integrity 
and compliance and thus deepen the trust of our employees, cus-
tomers, shareholders and partners – both existing ones and those 
we hope to win over in the future.
Our aim is therefore to create a business whose rules, processes and 
corporate culture are geared to ensuring that every employee be-
haves with integrity and in compliance with the rules at all times. 
To realize the ambitions of TOGETHER 2025+, since 2018 we have 
built a comprehensive and holistic integrity and compliance man-
agement system, which is being rolled out across the group 
through the “Together4Integrity” (T4I) program. In this context we 
are also implementing the measures that we defined based on the 
recommendations made by the Independent Compliance Monitor 
Larry D. Thompson.
T4I is our joint path to establish robust and consistent process 
standards and permanently anchor these in our Group and organi-
zational policies. Our objective is to ensure that integrity and com-
pliance permanently have the same strategic and operational pri-
ority as, for example, sales revenue, profit, product quality or 
employer attractiveness. T4I is thus one of the most extensive 
change programs in the history of the Group. The Integrity and Le-
gal Affairs function of the Board of Management is responsible for 
designing and implementing the program. In September 2020, the 
Group Board of Management adopted a resolution to establish the 
Integrity and Compliance Group Board of Management Committee 
(K-VAC), which, among other things, is assuming the tasks of the 
Group Compliance Committee set up during the monitorship. The 
K-VAC’s core tasks include further developing the integrity and 
compliance management system and corporate culture and man-
aging the uniform implementation of the initiatives bundled un-
der T4I across departments and brands. K-VAC is thus taking on the 
tasks of the Group Compliance Committee, which it replaced.
T4I will roll out the integrity and compliance management system 
in the Volkswagen Group by 2022 and will implement the system 
by 2025. This will strengthen Group-wide corporate governance 
and reduce associated risks. The integrity and compliance manage-
ment system thus constitutes a substantial contribution to the 
Volkswagen Group’s sustainability and resilience.
An average of eight legal entities started implementation each cal-
endar week in the reporting year, which means the speed reached 
the planned peak despite the particular challenges resulting from 
the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 639 legal entities had started 
implementation by the end of the reporting year. These entities 
employ more than 90% of all employees in companies majori-
ty-owned by the Volkswagen Group.
CERTIFICATION BY THE U.S. MONITOR
In September 2020, the independent compliance monitor Larry D. 
Thompson certified that Volkswagen had met its commitment un-
der its Plea Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to revise 
and strengthen its structures, processes and systems so that viola-
tions of anti-fraud and environmental laws are detected and pre-
vented. This includes introducing a Group-wide uniform Code of 
Conduct, expanding the whistleblower system, establishing a Group 
Compliance Committee (later Integrity and Compliance Group 
Board of Management Committee) and HR Steering Committee in 
the Group, and a new role for Environment, Health & Safety at 
Volkswagen Group of America. Overall, Volkswagen implemented 
nearly 300 new or revised internal regulations and policies in the 
relevant legal entities during the Monitorship. The organization, 
structure and functions relating to the Compliance, Integrity Man-
agement, Risk Management and Legal departments were described 
with binding effect in the Group policy on “Governance and Integri-
ty, Risk Management, Compliance and Legal Affairs (GRC+L). With 
the launch of T4I in spring 2018, all activities for establishing a com-
prehensive integrity and compliance management system and im-
plementing it across the Group were bundled in this program.
The monitor’s certification applies to Volkswagen AG and its subsidi-
aries and affiliates with the exception of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG 
and Porsche Cars North America, which were not part of the Moni-
torship. The certification also confirms the successful implementa-
tion of the T4I program in the ten most important Group companies 
by size and risk profile and thus the effectiveness and sustainabili-
ty of the Volkswagen Group’s comprehensive integrity and compli-
ance management system. On September 2, 2019, Volkswagen ad-
ditionally published the news that the Group had concluded a plea 
agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
due to which a second auditor was engaged for the Volkswagen 
Group. This agreement was concluded so as not to be excluded 
from public-sector contracts in the USA. This second auditorship 
has been set up for three years and will run through August 2022.
INTEGRITY PROMOTES ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING
The Integrity Management department is a central pillar of holistic 
integrity and compliance management system at Group level. Its 
task is to emphasize integrity as an important strategic lever of suc-
cess for the Volkswagen Group in all brands and companies. This 
includes incorporating integrity as a key performance indicator in 
decision-making processes and thus working towards decisions in 
the Group always being made according to ethical criteria. For ex-
ample, every resolution proposal submitted to the Group Board of 
Management must highlight the way in which the intended deci-
sion and its consequences are in line with the Group’s integrity and 
compliance, and whether/what integrity or compliance risks are 
associated with it and how they can be lessened. In the same way, 
integrity is also laid down as a criterion for decisions by the boards 
of management of the individual Group brands and companies, as 
well as in the Group bodies to which the Board of Management has 
delegated decision-making powers.

Integrity Management makes the importance of integrity visible 
and tangible through communication, training and participation 
formats. It should motivate employees and managers to act with 
integrity even under external pressure and will particularly spur 
managers to act as role models for integrity and encourage their 
employees to act with integrity. For example, the topic of making 
decisions with integrity was integrated into a training for the 
Group’s senior managers and the topic of “integrity in advertising 
and communication” was included in a training and in principles 
for advertising and communication for employees from marketing 
and sales during the reporting year.
As a Group function, Integrity Management also helps the Group 
companies and brand companies to implement the integrity pro-
gram’s measures within the framework of T4I and carries out the 
quality assurance for this.
COMPLIANCE MEANS ADHERENCE TO RULES
We are convinced that lasting economic success can only be 
achieved if each individual complies with laws, internal regulations 
and voluntary commitments. Compliant behavior must be a mat-
ter of course for all Group employees. The compliance organization 
provides support around the world with programs, guidelines for 
action, processes and practical advice and thus significantly con-
tributes to the success of the T4I program. The compliance Info-
point is a core element of this. Employees of the Group can contact 
it with their compliance questions at any time. The compliance in-
formation point team gives a direct recommendation on the situa-
tion or passes the question on to a competent body. The compliance 
information point received 1,482 inquiries in the reporting year 
(previous year: 1,761) (Volkswagen AG). This is equivalent to a 
change of –16% year-on-year. The decrease in monthly inquiries to 
the compliance information point correlates with the emergence of 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Group Compliance also supports and advises the Group and brand 
companies, helping them to conduct their business activities in ac-
cordance with the rules and to consistently adhere to relevant laws 
and internal regulations. The focus of our compliance organization 
is on anti-corruption, breaches of trust, the prevention of money 
laundering and the topic of business and human rights. M&A com-
pliance in M&A transactions and noncontrolled shareholdings was 
added to Compliance’s scope in the reporting year.

COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE IN THE GROUP
Our global compliance organization is headed by the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Director of Integri-
ty and Legal Affairs and the Audit Committee of the Volkswagen 
AG Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the compliance organization 
is organized by division in the Group, which ensures communica-
tion and harmonized implementation of processes across all rele-
vant Group companies. The divisional compliance officers are gen-
erally responsible for several brands (a brand company group) and 
implement compliance measures in their area of responsibility. 
Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG is an exception: the divisional compliance 
officers there are only responsible for their own brand. The region-
al compliance officer is responsible for the activities of 
Volkswagen-controlled entities in China.

BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE COMPLIANCE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In the reporting year, we further advanced the integration of the 
topic of business and human rights into the compliance manage-
ment system and gave the topic key strategic importance. The com-
pliance management system for business and human rights (CMS 
BHR) is geared to the UN’s requirements and specifications regard-
ing business and human rights due diligence. The key components 
comprise: 1) recognize risks (scoring), 2) mitigate risks, 3) track ac-
tion implementation and 4) report on it. The fifth key element is 
the complaint mechanism, our whistleblower system.
In the reporting year, the human rights risks for the controlled en-
tities of the Volkswagen Group that are within the scope of Compli-
ance were scored. On this basis, each of the companies received a 
package of measures corresponding to their respective risk class, 
which must be implemented from January 1, 2022.
 
 Responsibility in Supply Chains and Business
T4I BUNDLES THE ACTIVITIES OF ELEVEN KEY INITIATIVES
The Integrity and Compliance Management System defined stan-
dards for ensuring integrity and compliance for a total of 16 depart-
ments, including not only Integrity Management and Compliance 
but also Risk Management, Human Resources, Procurement and 
Production. Through T4I, these standards are being uniformly 
rolled out and implemented throughout the Group in the form of 
over 100 packages of measures. The packages of measures are the-
matically grouped in eleven key initiatives:
1) HR Compliance Policies and Procedures: The core topic of this 
key initiative is the integration of integrity and compliance into 
standard HR processes such as recruitment, training, promotion 
and remuneration (granting bonuses). For example, integrity and 
compliance have been criteria in the recruitment process and in 
staff development for managers since 2019. Employment contracts 
contain integrity and compliance clauses. Integrity and compli-
ance have also been an obligatory topic in the annual employee ap-
praisal since 2020. In addition, integrity and compliance have been 
introduced as a required component of performance-related remu-
neration from the Board of Management to management level. 
Training measures for current and newly recruited employees at 
different hierarchy levels include integrity and compliance as im-
portant components. Integrity and compliance are already an-
chored in around 20 HR core processes at Volkswagen AG. The 
measures of this key initiative also include anonymized statistics 
on misconduct for Volkswagen AG and other defined companies 
and the resulting sanctions being regularly communicated to 
employees.
2) Code of Conduct: The Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct is the 
key instrument for strengthening employees’ awareness of respon-
sible conduct and decision-making, giving employees support and 
guidance, and finding the right contact persons in cases of doubt. 
The framework is available online to employees and also to exter-
nal third parties.
A reference to the Code of Conduct and the obligation to comply 
with it are a fixed part of employment contracts. The Code of Con-
duct is also part of our employee appraisals and was thus taken 
into account when calculating their variable, performance-related 
remuneration. Members of the higher levels of management are 
annually certified on the Code of Conduct. They confirm that they 
will comply with the Code of Conduct and undertake to report any 
serious regulatory violations. This key initiative also includes reg-
ularly reviewing whether the Code of Conduct is up to date and 
adapting it as required.
Regularly training the workforce on the Code of Conduct is decisive 
for the effectiveness of all compliance activities.  The training is 
regularly repeated with new and expanded content and document-
ed in employees’ training history for relevant target groups. In the 
reporting year, 46,356 employees in Volkswagen AG had a valid 
qualification on the Code of Conduct. This is equivalent to 98.9% of 
the workforce at Volkswagen AG that has to be qualified. The inter-
national rollout of the Code of Conduct training continued within 
the Volkswagen Group in the reporting year. This will also be con-
tinued in 2021.
3) Integrity program: The integrity program aims to reinforce the 
culture of integrity. Its most important tools include numerous di-
alog-oriented communication measures and event formats that 
convey the key importance of integrity for the Group to employees 
and should spur them to act with integrity even under extreme 
pressure. It is associated with encouraging the constructive han-
dling of mistakes, increasing the transparency of reasons for deci-
sions and strengthening willingness to also address aberrations 
and risks with managers. Managers are supported in regularly 
making integrity and compliance the topic of team meetings and 
living up to their role as role models.
Information about the integrity program is regularly provided at 
works meetings, in individual departments, to shop stewards or also 
vocational trainees. In addition, as the Director of Integrity and Legal 
Affairs, Hiltrud D. Werner regularly has direct discussions with em-
ployees about integrity-related challenges in day-to-day work. Mul-
timedia communication activities that focus on issues surrounding 
the topic of integrity were also launched in 2020.
The integrity ambassadors – volunteers from various departments 
who advance the topic of integrity, carry it into the structures of 
the Group and engage in dialog – are also of key importance.

4) Risk management and internal control processes: This key ini-
tiative is about the operation of an effective risk management sys-
tem. Transparent handling and appropriate management of risks 
that may arise in our business are regulated through defined struc-
tures and processes. This includes the regulation of standards and 
procedures of the annual GRC control process, which focuses on 
systemic risks; the QRP (quarterly risk process), which looks at 
acute risks; the standard ICS (internal control system), which aims 
to safeguard essential processes; and root-cause analysis in order to 
gain knowledge from the breaches identified so that these can be 
excluded as well as possible for the future. The risks identified and 
countermeasures taken to reduce the risks must be included in the 
regular reporting to the management of the relevant company. The 
introduction of the Risk Radar IT system and appropriate training 
of risk managers are also topics in this key initiative, as well as 
measures to strengthen a lived risk culture in which employees are 
called upon to openly talk about risks.
5) Internal Compliance risk assessment and Compliance organi-
zation: This key initiative concerns the organization and processes 
of the Compliance department at Group level and in the individual 
Group companies. It determines what the Volkswagen Group’s 
compliance strategy should be, what standards apply across the 
Group for the Internal Compliance Risk Assessment (ICRA) and how 
the compliance risks identified will be overcome and reduced – 
particularly corruption, money laundering and embezzlement. The 
Group-wide compliance risk analysis (ICRA) has been conducted 
since 2018. The Group companies are assigned to different risk cate-
gories on the basis of a comprehensive questionnaire. To reduce the 
potential risks, we have rolled out standardized compliance meas-
ures in the relevant business units. The scale of the mea sures varies 
depending on the risk situation of the business unit in question. 
The implementation status of the measures is reported on a regular 
basis, but at least once per year. The implementation of the meas-
ures – of which the Code of Conduct also forms an integral part – 
for all high-risk business units is additionally regularly checked by 
the divisional compliance officer or regional compliance officer 
through an on-site visit and, starting in 2021, then audited by an 
external auditor in order to regularly ensure indepen dent external 
verification of the compliance management system. In the report-
ing year, the ICRA was updated with the aim of representing possi-
ble compliance risks of newly added Group companies. The next 
ICRA cycle begins in 2021. This is followed by the implementation 
of an updated program of measures to reduce risks on the basis of 
the respective risk profile.
6) Whistleblower system: All measures that relate to the establish-
ment and operation of the whistleblower system as a central point 
of contact for reporting serious breaches of rules in the Volkswagen 
Group are brought together in this key initiative. Examples of mat-
ters generally involving serious rule-breaking include economic, 
corruption-related, tax and environmental offenses, breaches of 
human rights, infringements of antitrust and competition law, 
money laundering and terrorist financing, infringements of rules 
on product safety and approval, and serious data protection 
breaches. The aim of the whistleblower system is to protect the 
Company and its employees through the use of binding principles 
and a clearly governed process. An investigation is only initiated af-
ter the information received has undergone a thorough examina-
tion and the latter has identified concrete indications of rule-break-
ing. Appropriate sanctions are applied where misconduct is proven. 
The affected parties are treated fairly: the presumption of inno-
cence applies unless rule-breaking is proven. Their response is 
heard as soon as possible, and, if necessary, their names are cleared 
if they have been wrongly accused. Strict confidentiality and secre-
cy apply throughout the investigation process. Whistleblowers are 
also protected and their statements are treated confidentially. The 
whistleblower system is coordinated through the Central Investiga-
tion Office in Wolfsburg, which is also responsible for handling in-
formation from whistleblowers concerning Volkswagen AG and its 
subsidiaries. Audi AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG and TRATON SE 
each have separate investigative offices for themselves and their 
subsidiaries. Due to requirements under local law, there is also a re-
gional investigation office at Volkswagen (China) Investment Com-
pany Ltd., which processes information concerning Volkswagen 
AG’s Chinese subsidiaries. If the Central Investigation Office estab-
lishes that whistleblower information received by the brand inves-
tigation offices or the regional investigation office has Group rele-
vance, it can also take up this information. It monitors and 
coordinates the brand investigation offices and the regional inves-
tigation office. A wide range of channels is available for reporting 
information on misconduct by Volkswagen Group employees. 
There is a specially protected online reporting channel, which ac-
cepts written whistleblower information in any language, and an 
international 24-hour telephone hotline through which whistle-
blower information can be reported in a total of 17 languages. In 
addition, whistleblower information can also be reported via com-
missioned external attorneys (ombudsmen). Reports can also be 
made anonymously in all channels if preferred. In 2020, approxi-
mately 2,900 pieces of whistleblower information were registered 
across the Group (including China) at the aforementioned investi-
gation offices (2019: approximately 3,200¹). In the reporting year, 
20% of the whistleblower information was reported anonymously 
but with the option to contact the whistleblower and 11% was re-
ported anonymously without the option to make contact. Around 
88% of whistleblowers permitted the investigation office to contact 
them (2019: around 90%).

REPORTING CHANNELS OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM
7) M&A and NCS compliance: In the event of planned mergers and 
acquisitions, the compliance and integrity standards of the compa-
nies in question are checked. This should prevent a Group company 
from being confronted with unidentified integrity or compliance 
risks when acquiring another company. In addition, this key initia-
tive also promotes compliance in noncontrolled shareholdings 
(NCS), i.e. companies that are not controlled by a company of the 
Volkswagen Group as the majority owner. Strategic, economic and 
ethical decision-making parameters are essential for the sus tain-
abil ity of investment decisions in M&A transactions and when sup-
porting NCS.
8) Business partner due diligence: Business partner due diligence 
(BPDD) is an audit of the integrity and compliance systems of busi-
ness partners and selected suppliers and service providers. This re-
view of existing and potentially new business partners is carried 
out as part of a risk-based, transparent, documented process that is 
implemented worldwide using an IT-based tool. 6,000 BPDD re-
views were carried out in the reporting year. More than 350 prob-
lematic cases have already been identified here and the companies 
excluded as business partners. Offering business partners support 
with meeting the necessary standards is also part of this key initia-
tive. Companies who cannot meet the standards should not be giv-
en any new business.
9) Product compliance: The product compliance management sys-
tem (PCMS) is intended to support our products in meeting the 
statutory and regulatory requirements of the exporting and im-
porting countries, external standards and contractually agreed 
customer requirements, internal standards and externally com-
municated commitments over their entire service life. Our PCMS 
defines roles and responsibilities for design, implementation and 
monitoring. Product compliance should be taken into account in 
the relevant decisions through decision-making and reporting 
paths. The aims, tasks, roles and responsibilities within the PCMS 
are regularly communicated in order to create the greatest possible 
awareness of product compliance.  We train workers and managers 
in product compliance with targeted trainings. We continuously re-
view the effectiveness of our PCMS in order to detect deviations 
and derive countermeasures in the sense of a continuous improve-
ment process. We have central points of contact to which our em-
ployees can address their questions about product compliance.
10) Environmental compliance: The Volkswagen Group has the 
clear goal of meeting the statutory environmental regulations and 
voluntary commitments at all sites and in all areas of business. The 
Group’s environmental policy and the environmental compliance 
management system (ECMS) stipulate that environmentally rele-
vant aspects and requirements must be taken into account in all 
strategy, planning and decision-making processes of the brands 
and Group companies and define the responsibilities. This also in-
cludes a system of key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring 
progress on reaching environmental targets, e.g. the use of renew-
able energies, the reduction of CO2 emissions and resource efficien-
cy. We take account of the actual and potential environmental risks 
and opportunities along the entire life cycle of our products and 
prepare for dangerous situations in order to protect our employees, 
our customers, society and the environment. Our employees re-
ceive trainings on climate and environmental requirements in or-
der to guarantee a sustainable impact.
11) Combating corruption: We stand for fairness in business deal-
ings and advocate a clear zero tolerance policy regarding active and 
passive corruption that is anchored in Group guidelines on dealing 
with gifts and invitations and on granting donations and sponsor-
ing. This key initiative also includes the development and imple-
mentation of trainings for employees in areas for companies with 
high risk exposure.
In the reporting year, the Group implemented two mandatory anti- 
corruption trainings, which are also being rolled out across the 
Group. Basic knowledge on the topic of anti-corruption is provided, 
but so is in-depth content on the topic of dealing with officeholders 
and mandate holders. This training was preceded by a comprehen-
sive risk assessment to identify high-risk contacts with officehold-
ers and mandate holders in order to specify the target audience. 
45,717 employees at Volkswagen AG had a valid qualification on the 
topic of anti-corruption in the reporting year. This is equivalent to 
97.5% of the workforce at Volkswagen AG that must be qualified. 
For the first time, training and raising awareness on the issue of anti- 
corruption is being aimed not only at specific groups within the 
Company but also at business partners from sales and procure-
ment departments based on the level of risk.
37
S T R AT E G Y  A N D  M A N A G E M E N T
As a result of whistleblower information, in the reporting year, the 
investigation offices discovered individual gifts that were not per-
mitted according to internal rules for preventing corruption. The 
breaches were intensively dealt with and the employees in question 
were sanctioned. The prevention of corruption and the right con-
duct when dealing with conflicts of interest, officeholders and 
mandate holders are at the heart of continuous compliance com-
munication. The practical “anti-corruption” guideline can be ac-
cessed at any time on internal and external websites for Group em-
ployees and external third parties. Employees and managers’ 
awareness of the issue is regularly raised with information docu-
ments, documentation, films, example cases and extensive com-
munication activities, particularly around International Anti-Cor-
ruption Day. 
The prohibition of corruption is additionally enshrined in the Code 
of Conduct for Business Partners. This code is communicated to 
partners via Sales and Procurement’s relevant platforms and com-
munication channels. Employees and external third parties can also 
view it on the Group website at any time. 
VIGOROUSLY FURTHER DEVELOPING INTEGRITY CULTURE
The holistic integrity and compliance management system that is 
being established Group-wide through T4I provides the sustainably 
anchored regulatory framework for acting with integrity and in 
compliance with the rules and strengthens uniform corporate gov-
ernance throughout the Group in relation to integrity and compli-
ance. In addition, the program also serves to vigorously further de-
velop the culture of integrity. The aim is to inspire and motivate 
employees and strengthen their own drive to act with integrity in 
all situations.  Both the standardized corporate governance and a 
developed culture of integrity support the effectiveness of the in-
tegrity and compliance management system as a key factor of the 
Volkswagen Group’s sustainability.
Volkswagen’s corporate culture is founded on the seven Group Es-
sentials. These essentials define how we at Volkswagen want to 
work together and they supplement the Code of Conduct. The 
Group Essentials also form the frame of reference for the role mod-
el program for encouraging dialog-oriented and distance-reducing 
collaboration. The program focuses on managers in leadership 
functions, who are to be supported by the program to ensure a cul-
ture of open discussion in which questions, risks or conflicting ob-
jectives can be discussed without fear of sanctions.
In T4I, T4I launch events and T4I perception workshops are the 
main ways in which we want to inspire and motivate people. Both 
events are held in each Group or brand company at the start of the 
implementation of T4I and involve both employees and their man-
agers across hierarchies as players in the change process. The joint 
design and implementation of these events increases awareness of 
each individual’s valuable contribution to the success of the change 
among participants. In addition, they offer the opportunity to 
openly ask critical questions and name problems. The perception 
workshops are primarily about the actual practice of integrity and 
compliance – measured by the perception of employees. Here, rep-
resentatively selected employees and managers give their assess-
ment and discuss opportunities for improvement. Afterwards, the 
results are analyzed and relevant insights are derived. We found 
that an average of 83% of participants know our corporate values. 
An average of 93% of those surveyed know that they are expected 
to conduct themselves in line with the Volkswagen Group’s values 
in the work environment.
In order to measure the respective company’s progress on integrity 
and compliance and possibly identify continuing need for action, 
the perception workshops will be repeated annually until T4I’s key 
initiatives have been completely implemented. These recurrent 
perception workshops also provide the opportunity to hone activi-
ties, deepen discussions and further reinforce awareness of the im-
portance and objectives of the change process. All recurrent per-
ception workshops demonstrated an improved result compared to 
the initial measurement. An average of 90% of participants now 
know our corporate values, and an average of 96% of those sur-
veyed know that they are expected to conduct themselves in line 
with the Volkswagen Group’s values in the work environment.
Since the start of the T4I program, 86 launch events have been held 
in 50 countries, with more than 8,900 managers and workers in to-
tal taking part in them. In the same period, we held 136 perception 
workshops in 37 countries, of which 24 were recurring perception 
workshops that took place in ten countries. More than 10,600 peo-
ple took part in total. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was only 
possible to hold a smaller number of these events in 2020 than 
planned. To make up for this, online formats were piloted in some 
cases.
In order to provide clarity about the comprehensive integrity and 
compliance management system and its use for the organization, 
but also for each individual, the program is supported by a number 
of communication measures and formats. These communication 
activities are also being rolled out within the T4I program.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with 
our business activities and taking a forward-thinking approach to 
managing them is crucial to our Group’s long-term success. A fore-
sighted risk management process and effective internal control 
systems are therefore vitally important to us. Not only do we set 
high internal standards, we also insist that all our suppliers along 
our entire value chain comply with these standards.
 
 Integrity and Compliance
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
A comprehensive risk management system and internal control 
system (RMS/ICS) helps us to handle risks responsibly. It defines 
the primary principles and elements of our Group, forming the 
basis for the appropriate and effective management and control 
of material risks. This applies to risks with consequences for the 
Volkswagen Group and/or for the environment and society. It is 
thus also directly applicable to the assessment of nonfinancial risks 
that could arise in the course of implementing the new sus tain abil-
ity narrative, including the goals and actions in the four defined 
focus areas.
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Organ-
izations of the Treadway Commission). Through a Group risk man-
agement policy, all business divisions and units are obliged to im-
plement an RMS/ICS. The Group Risk Management function 
supports the departments through corresponding training. The 
Board of Management receives ad hoc, quarterly and annual risk 
reports.
MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS
Methods of monitoring impact in measuring progress are an inte-
gral part of the Volkswagen Group’s integrity and compliance man-
agement system.
In this way, the T4I program’s central planning and reporting sys-
tem creates permanent transparency about the level of implemen-
tation of all packages of measures within the key initiatives. This 
serves as the basis both for reporting to the Board of Management 
and the boards of the Group and brand companies and for monitor-
ing timely implementation and the initiation of measures in the 
event of significant delays.
In addition to the recurrent perception workshops already men-
tioned, our annual employee survey, the Opinion Survey, is our pri-
mary source of information about the progress of our culture of in-
tegrity. The possibility for each individual to act with integrity is an 
explicit aspect of this Group-wide survey: “In our organizational 
unit, is it possible for everyone to act with integrity?”. If employees 
think this possibility is in doubt in a particular organizational unit, 
the relevant manager must identify and clear the possible obstacles 
together with their team. The question was asked in the opinion 
survey for the first time in 2017 and since then, including in the re-
porting period, has been one of the three questions with the high-
est level of agreement, with significant improvement in the figure. 
Employee agreement on average reached a level in the highest cate-
gory of the underlying five-point scale in each case.
To measure developments in the Integrity and Legal operating 
unit, we defined the “compliance, culture of dealing openly with 
mistakes and acting with integrity” strategic indicator for the major 
brands that manufacture passenger cars. This is also based on the 
Opinion Survey, specifically on the evaluation of answers to three 
questions relating to compliance with regulations and processes, 
dealing with risks and errors, and whether it is possible to act with 
integrity. In the case of negative deviations, the affected depart-
ments develop and implement measures. In 2020, the key perfor-
mance indicator continuously improved, coming from an already 
good starting point. Employee agreement was in the highest cate-
gory of the underlying five-point scale on average in each case.
We use the integrity index as a further tool to measure our status 
and progress in integrity and compliance. This index comprehen-
sively tracks an organization’s integrity and was started as a pilot 
project for Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi (in each case the 
German sites) in 2019. More than 100 measuring points in the com-
pliance & infrastructure, working atmosphere & culture of integri-
ty, product & customers, society and partners & markets categories 
were collected and evaluated by independent researchers from the 
field of business ethics. The researchers found that both of the 
brands examined exhibited a good integrity level overall. However, 
the detailed results signaled a need for action in various places.
Following a decision by the Group Board of Management, the find-
ings were therefore used in a structured follow-up process in the re-
porting year in order to derive and implement improvement mea-
sures together with the departments. These improvement measures 
concern revisions of internal guidelines, for example in the area of 
procurement; a higher level of transparency in reporting, for ex-
ample on the number and type of confirmed cases of corruption; 
or clearer commitments by the Volkswagen Group, for example on 
the topic of animal welfare. The aim is to raise the integrity level at 
the two pilot companies to the next level. Achievement of the tar-
get will be assessed with the planned follow-up integrity index sur-
vey at Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi AG in the second quar-
ter of 2021.

The focus of our RMS/ICS is the three lines model – a basic element 
required by, among others, the European Confederation of Insti-
tutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). In line with this model, our 
RMS/ICS has three lines that are designed to protect us from the 
occurrence of material risks.
• The first line comprises the risk management and internal con-
trol systems at the individual Group companies and divisions. 
The RMS/ICS is an integral part of our Group’s organizational 
structures and processes.
• The second line is the Group Risk Management function, which 
sets standards for the RMS/ICS and coordinates the quarterly 
risk survey and annual governance, risk and compliance (GRC) 
control process. It reports to the Group Board of Management on 
any material risks, which are defined in terms of quantitative 
and qualitative assessment criteria and given probability ratings.
• The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which carries 
out regular checks on the structure and implementation of the 
RMS as part of its independent audit activities.
SUSTAINABILITY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
The Volkswagen Group continuously develops its risk management 
in order to take account of increased internal and external require-
ments in the field of corporate responsibility. This particularly ap-
plies to the instrument of the list of risk focus areas used by the 
Group, which is divided into 18 different modules. In 2020, we 
made necessary updates in the three compliance/fraud, develop-
ment and sustainability modules following reviews. The new focus 
areas were introduced and a change was made in the assignment of 
existing focus areas to the modules in particular for the purpose of 
better recording and preventing risks in the areas of product and 
environmental compliance.
The list of risk focus areas is to be used by all entities affected. The 
Group Risk Management function and the brand risk management 
units can declare selected areas of focus, such as on the aspects of 
sustainability and compliance, mandatory for the relevant units. 
Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general en-
vironmental risks and climate-change risks. These include risks 
that could result from differing CO2 and emissions regulations, but 
also extreme weather, storms or floods with effects on production, 
infrastructure and supply chains. The risks relevant from the 
Volkswagen Group’s perspective are presented in the report on 
risks and opportunities in the management report. In fiscal year 
2020, risks were identified with regard to compliance with regula-
tions on fleet CO2 emissions in individual brands and markets. 
A more detailed description is available in the report on risks and 
opportunities in the Annual Report under the heading “Environ-
mental Protection Regulations.”

Risks and Opportunities
Further information on financial consequences, risks and opportu-
nities of climate change is provided in the TCFD reference table and 
in the report on risks and opportunities in the Annual Report.
NONFINANCIAL RISKS
The Group risk management processes also take account of the 
risks for nonfinancial matters in accordance with the CSR-Richtlin-
ie-Umsetzungsgesetz (CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implemen-
tation Act). Here, we have assigned concrete risks from the list of fo-
cus areas to the individual matters as a priority. For example:
• Environmental matters
 - Environmentally relevant risks from operating processes/ 
production in normal operation
 - Environmentally relevant risks from products
 - Environmentally relevant risks from disruption of operating 
processes/production
• Employee matters
 - Personnel risks with regard to occupational safety and health
 - Risks from the use of employees from outside companies with-
in the framework of contracts for work and service contracts
• Social matters
 - Risks of noncompliance with social responsibility
 - Risks of violation of health and safety-related regulations
• Adhering to human rights
 - Risks of non-compliance with human rights
• Combating corruption and bribery
 - Risks of active corruption
 - Risks of passive corruption
 - Misappropriation and embezzlement risks
The Volkswagen Group generates significant negative effects with 
regard to the environment with its business and products due to 
CO2 emissions across the entire life cycle. We would like to make 
our contribution to achieving the two-degree target in the Paris 
Agreement by giving our whole Group a carbon-neutral footprint 
by 2050. To this end, the topic of decarbonization has been firmly 
anchored as a focus area in the TOGETHER 2025+ strategy. More in-
formation on the effects, targets and measures can be found in the 
“Decarbonization” chapter. Beyond this, no further risks with very 
likely serious negative effects have been identified.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
COMMITMENT TO AN UNDAMAGED ENVIRONMENT
As the largest automotive manufacturer in the world, we have to 
observe extensive legal requirements for all sites and markets and 
must live up to our stakeholders’ justifiably high expectations of 
the effectiveness of environmental management – including, and 
especially following, the diesel crisis. We also want to live up to our 
voluntary commitments on environmental matters and compliant 
behavior. The environmental compliance management system is 
therefore in particular a risk provision against breaches of regula-
tions that may be associated with damage to the environment, our 
Group and society. The aim of effective environmental manage-
ment at Volkswagen always includes the continuous improvement 
of environmental performance.
Environmental protection is not only a central goal of our TO-
GETHER 2025+ Group strategy: we want to be a “role model as re-
gards environment”. At the same time, the environmental compat-
ibility of our products, services and processes is one of our Group 
Essentials. With electric drives, digital connectivity and autono-
mous driving, we want to make the automobile clean, intelligent, 
quiet and safe. We use our innovative power in order to reduce our 
environmental footprint – over the entire life cycle of our products 
and mobility solutions. Our innovations are at the same time in-
tended to help our customers be more environmentally friendly.
THE “GOTOZERO” MISSION STATEMENT: MINIMIZATION OF 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT
The Volkswagen Group bundles all its measures in environmental 
protection under the “goTOzero” environmental mission state-
ment. This concept sets the agenda for a way of doing business that 
is as environmentally friendly as possible with a footprint that is as 
carbon-neutral as possible. The Volkswagen Group has set itself the 
goal of achieving this by 2050.
Literally the environmental Group mission statement says: “For all 
our products and mobility solutions we aspire to minimize envi-
ronmental impacts along the entire life cycle – from raw material 
extraction to end-of-life – in order to keep ecosystems intact and to 
create positive impacts on society. Compliance with environmental 
regulations, standards and voluntary commitments is a basic pre-
requisite of our actions.” This Group environmental mission state-
ment combines all strategic and compliance-related aspects of the 
Group’s environmental activities for the first time and forms the 
basis for linking targets, key performance indicators, programs and 
measures.
In its “goTOzero” mission statement, the Volkswagen Group con-
centrates on four action areas.
• Climate change: Volkswagen is committed to complying with 
the United Nations’ Paris Agreement. The goal is to become a 
company with a carbon-neutral footprint by 2050. As early as by 
2025, the Group plans to reduce the total life-cycle greenhouse 
gas emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
by 30% compared to 2015. The Group will also actively drive the 
transition towards renewable energies along the entire life cycle.
• Resources: Volkswagen will further improve its resource efficien-
cy and promote reuse and recycling approaches in the areas of 
materials, energy and water. By 2025, the Group plans to have re-
duced the production-related environmental impact with re-
spect to energy, water, waste and volatile organic compounds by 
45% per vehicle compared to 2010.
• Air quality: Volkswagen is also driving e-mobility forward to im-
prove local air quality. To achieve the legal requirements for CO2 
fleet emissions, the plan is to increase the proportion of electric 
vehicles in the model portfolio in Europe to approximately 20%. 
The proportion of electric vehicles in the new passenger car fleet 
in Europe and China is to rise to at least 40% by 2030.
• Environmental compliance: With respect to integrity, 
Volkswagen aims to set an example for a modern, transparent 
and successful business by installing and monitoring effective 
management systems that cover the environmental impact of its 
mobility solutions across all life-cycle phases.

 Environmental Mission Statement
MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IN MATTERS OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Volkswagen has written an environmental policy for its environ-
mental decision-making and for the management of projects and 
for its conduct in environmental protection. This specifies the ac-
tion principles relevant for the achievement of the objectives. We 
have also implemented a Group policy for the environmental com-
pliance management system describing requirements, tasks and 
responsibilities with regard to the environment and compliance. 
This policy provides the framework for implementing environ-
mental compliance management systems across all phases of the 
business and the entire life cycle in our brands and companies. The 
policy defines the minimum requirements for operating organiza-
tions regarding implementing an environmental compliance man-
agement system and gives them the flexibility to implement this 
in a manner in line with their business activities. 
Certification by third parties of environmental management sys-
tems in accordance with ISO 14001 or the Eco-Management and 
Audit Scheme (EMAS) has been a mandatory target for all production 
locations and for companies involved in product development 
GRI 308-2

since 2019. Because the standards do not, however, answer the 
question of how to avoid misconduct and how to respond appropri-
ately to it, the Volkswagen Group has expanded the established en-
vironmental management system to include the important com-
pliance aspect.
The Group Board of Management is the highest internal deci-
sion-making level for environmental matters. Both the Volkswagen 
AG Board of Management and the boards of management of the 
brands take account not just of economic, but also social and envi-
ronmental aspects when making relevant business decisions. The 
Group-wide management of environmental protection is the re-
sponsibility of the Group Steering Committee for the Environment 
and Energy. It is the highest environmental committee in the 
Volkswagen Group and is responsible for reporting to the Group 
Board of Management or the environmental officer in the Group 
Board of Management. The Group Steering Committee for CO2 and 
the Group Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance and Exhaust 
Emissions manage important individual aspects for our products – 
such as CO2 and exhaust emissions. The Group Steering Committee 
for Sustainability is responsible for climate protection.
The Volkswagen Group coordinates the activities of the brands, 
which in turn manage measures in the individual regions. The 
brands and companies are organizationally responsible for them-
selves when it comes to environmental matters. They base their 
own environmental protection activities on the targets, guidelines 
and principles that apply throughout the Group. In order to prove 
that we have met our objectives, we disclose environmental key 
performance indicators annually and report transparently on the 
progress of our efforts.
Environmental officers and experts from throughout the Group 
meet regularly for the Group Environmental Talk in order to opti-
mize the environmental focus along the entire value chain at inter-
national level. Good progress has been made on the process of ex-
ternal certification. In 2020, 107 of our 118 sites including the central 
development areas were certified in accordance with ISO 14001 or 
EMAS. In terms of employee numbers, this equates to approxi-
mately 99%. In addition, 59 production locations have certified 
their energy management systems in accordance with ISO 50001. 
Since 2009, the “Integration of Environmental Factors into the 
Volkswagen Brand’s Product Development” model used in the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s technical development has also 
been certified to ISO/TR 14062. SEAT development is certified in 
accordance with ISO 14006.
We implement environmental compliance management systems 
to ensure that environmental compliance obligations are under-
stood and achieved in our business operations. We consider disre-
gard of these, fraud or misconduct to be a serious compliance breach. 
Whether our actions conform to the requirements of our environ-
mental policy and other environment-related Group specifications 
is evaluated annually and reported to the Group Board of Manage-
ment, to the respective boards of management of the brands and to 
the managing directors of the companies.
CHECKING AND COMPLYING WITH LIMITS
In internal combustion engines, we adhere to national and interna-
tional legal norms and limits. For example, the Euro 6d-TEMP 
standard has been obligatory for new registrations in the European 
Union since September 1, 2019. In addition to the use of the World-
wide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), it also re-
quires measurement in accordance with the RDE (= Real Driving 
Emissions) standard. Unlike with WLTP, emissions are not measured 
on a test bench – they are measured in actual road traffic. The tests 
are carried out by external and independent test laboratories. As of 
January 1, 2021, the Euro 6d standard becomes obligatory for all 
new registrations. This is accompanied by a further reduction in 
emission limits under RDE conditions.
In order to comply with the legal requirement within the frame-
work of the Euro 6 standard, our diesel vehicles come with an SCR 
catalytic converter as standard and all new TSI and TSFI gasoline 
engines have a particulate filter.
LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH DETERMINES ANALYSIS AND ACTIONS
We observe our environmental impact over the entire life cycle and 
all stages of the value chain. This includes the manufacturing pro-
cess with the extraction of raw materials, the manufacture of mate-
rials for the production process, the processes at our suppliers and 
our own production at our sites, the use phase with vehicle emis-
sions and the necessary provision of fuel and the ultimate recy-
cling of the scrap vehicle at the end of its life cycle. For detailed, 
ISO-standardized life cycle assessments (LCAs), we use special LCA 
software with our own LCA database LEAD (Life Cycle Environmen-
tal Assessment Database), which makes the exchange of harmo-
nized data throughout the Group and a standardized basis for cal-
culating our environmental performance possible. In the next step, 
we identify hot spots in the life cycle and deduce suitable solutions 
to reduce the environmental impact. We call this life cycle engi-
neering. In line with our life cycle approach, we involve our suppli-
ers in our efforts to minimize our environmental impact early on.

CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
Human interference in ecosystems, pollution, damage and the use 
of finite natural resources through economic activity make a re-
think and a change of direction unavoidable. The production of ve-
hicles also requires many raw materials. That is why the conserva-
tion of resources along the entire life cycle of our products and 
mobility solutions is a central pillar of our “goTOzero” concept. In 
this context, we want to maximize resource efficiency, promote 
circular economy approaches and set ourselves measurable targets.
Our targets in the areas of CO2, energy, water, waste and volatile or-
ganic compounds – the reduction in environmental impact in pro-
duction (UEP) – were defined within the production strategy and 
include objectives for the Group and its brands. Given their high 
environmental relevance, we focus particularly on energy and CO2.
REDUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTION 
(UEP)
On our way to achieving our targets regarding resource consump-
tion in production, we have made significant progress in the Group 
in the last few years. By 2025, we plan to have reduced production- 
related environmental externalities (CO2, energy, water, waste, vol-
atile organic compounds) by 45% per vehicle compared to 2010. The 
following figures show the development of these values from 2010 
to 2020 (data: 11+1 months).¹
• UEP: –32.8% (2019: –36.7%)
The following five indicators form the UEP KPI.:
• Specific energy requirements in MWh/vehicle: – 13.1%  
(2019: – 20.4%)
• Specific CO2 emissions in kg/vehicle: – 35.5% (2019: – 39.5%)
• Specific VOC emissions in kg/vehicle: – 61.5% (2019: – 59.4%)
• Specific water consumption in m³/vehicle: – 17.7%  
(2019: – 21.6%)
• Specific waste for disposal (production-specific volumes only) in 
tonnes/vehicle: – 57.5% (2019: – 59.5%)
In this reporting year too, many activities that have a positive in-
fluence on further reducing our factories’ environmental impact 
were carried out. However, the successes of these measures are not 
directly reflected in the environmental indicators of the UEP be-
cause the production quantities in this reporting year have fallen 
significantly due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. These 
lower production quantities mean there is an opposite effect in the 
UEP when calculating the specific environmental indicators that 
disguises the positive influence of the measures. This leads to lower 
values arithmetically compared to the previous year – with the ex-
ception of VOC emissions.
ZERO IMPACT FACTORY INITIATIVE
One element of the production strategy is the zero impact factory 
initiative. This is where the Volkswagen Group bundles its activities 
for greater resource efficiency. The aim of the initiative is produc-
tion that has no negative impact on the environment. An assess-
ment system checks how far removed a factory is from zero impact 
on the environment. As well as the criteria of climate protection 
and energy, emissions, water and waste, this also includes aspects 
such as the appearance of the factory, commitment to biodiversity, 
protecting the soil, avoidance of business disruptions, functioning 
environmental management, better resource efficiency towards a 
circular economy and environmentally neutral mobility manage-
ment for employees and the transportation of goods.
Specifically, we are working on the following key issues:
• Setting and achieving ambitious environmental targets for 
production
• Developing a long-term vision for environmental targets in pro-
duction and rolling it out across the Group
• Strengthening employees' environmental awareness
• Integration of relevant environmental aspects into processes
Following the completion of a test phase for the evaluation meth-
ods at eight different sites, this is now being prepared for long-term 
and mandatory use in the production strategy. With the IT-support-
ed “Massnahmen@web” system, we record environmental mea-
sures and encourage the Group-wide exchange of best practices. In 
the reporting year, around 1,500 implemented measures in the area 
of environment and energy were documented. They are aimed at 
improving infrastructure and production processes for passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles.
The Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy 
and additional subject-specific Group steering committees are sub-
stantially responsible for implementing the resource-efficiency 
programs and monitoring target achievement.

DECARBONIZATION

DECARBONIZATION
Climate change is one of humanity’s key challenges. The speed of 
global warming has rapidly increased in the last three decades. 
Stopping it is an obligation for us all. According to the calculations 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 
transport sector accounts for around 14% of global greenhouse gas 
emissions. As one of the world’s largest automotive manufacturers 
and mobility providers, we are aware of our responsibility. In con-
crete terms, over their entire life cycles, our products alone (pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles) are responsible for ap-
proximately 1% of the total global CO2 emissions produced.
Taking responsibility for effective climate protection, we have de-
fined the decarbonization of our Group and its products as a focus 
area and thus as a key element of our corporate strategy. Our ambi-
tion is:
We are committed to the 2 °C target of the Paris Climate Agreement. 
By 2050, we want our whole Group to become net carbon neutral.
This ambition for climate protection is also a core part of our 
 “goTOzero” environmental mission statement, which stands for a 
net carbon-free way of doing business.
We have set important milestones and intermediate goals for our-
selves along the way: we want to improve the total life-cycle carbon 
footprint of our passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 
30% compared to 2015 by as early as 2025. For this reason, we take a 
considerably broader perspective than the legal requirements re-
garding CO2 fleet compliance and want to take on a pioneering role 
in our industry.
The two levers with the greatest influence on emissions across the 
entire life cycle of Volkswagen products are the Group’s electric of-
fensive and the Renewable Energies strategy. This strategy involves 
the integration of renewably generated electricity into the use phase 
of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and switch-
ing plants’ external power supply to renewable energy globally.
The consistent electrification of our vehicle fleet opens up the way 
to sustainable, emission-free mobility for our customers. To this 
end, we plan to invest around €35 billion in electric mobility across 
the Group by 2025. To achieve the legal requirements for CO2 fleet 
emissions, the plan is to increase the proportion of electric vehicles 
in the model portfolio in Europe to approximately 20%.
During the reporting year, we once again significantly honed and 
extended our climate protection goals: the Volkswagen Group 
wants to reduce its vehicles’ CO2 emissions in production and dur-
ing the use phase by 30% between 2018 and 2030. The plan goes be-
yond the existing intermediate goals for 2025 because the new 
2030 goal is to be achieved through pure CO2 reduction and in-
cludes not only a goal for passenger cars but also a target for heavy 
trucks and buses from Scania, which represents a sub-target for the 
Group. This new additional target for 2030 was verified by the inde-
pendent Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The SBTi then con-
firmed to the Volkswagen Group that the Group meets the condi-
tions for limiting global warming to “significantly below 2 °C” with 
its climate goal. The SBTi is a partnership between the Carbon Dis-
closure Project (CDP), the UN Global Compact, the World Resources 
Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
The Group’s previous target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% per 
vehicle between 2015 and 2025 remains an intermediate goal. Be-
cause this also includes climate projects offsetting carbon, it is not 
verified by the SBTi. On the path to net climate neutrality, over 
and above the target now verified by the SBTi, the Group will natu-
rally also work with climate protection projects aimed at carbon 
offsetting.

In the reporting year, the Chairman of the Board of Management of 
the Volkswagen Group, together with the CEOs of ten further com-
panies with their registered office in Europe, expressly acknowl-
edged the EU’s Green Deal and the associated climate protection 
targets. The CEO Alliance is being shaped into an action alliance 
that brings together corporate strategies, sectors and companies on 
the path to a carbon-neutral Europe. The member companies repre-
sent all the important industrial sectors, annual revenue of more 
than €600 billion and 1.7 million employees. The companies in-
volved have set themselves the target of investing more than €100 
billion in their decarbonization roadmaps in the next few years 
and working together for climate protection across sectors.
DECARBONIZATION PROGRAM TARGETS WHOLE LIFE CYCLE
In order to achieve its targets, the Volkswagen Group is implement-
ing a comprehensive and holistic decarbonization program, which 
includes the whole life cycle of the vehicles. It is based on three key 
principles, which at the same time represent a setting of priorities: 
the top priority is measures with which CO2 emissions can be 
avoided or reduced. In second place follow measures with which we 
can gradually shift the energy supply in the entire value chain to 
renewable energy. Finally, we offset unavoidable CO2 emissions 
through climate protection projects that meet the highest interna-
tional standards.
The decarbonization of the Group not only means we are living up 
to our responsibility as one of the world’s leading mobility busi-
nesses but also opens up new business potential and competitive 
advantages for us. In this way, we meet the growing requirements 
of a wide variety of stakeholders and lay the foundation for a prod-
uct portfolio fit for the future. This ensures our future and success. 
Decarbonization thus strengthens the value of our Group and is an 
important instrument for providing for climate-related risks that 
could threaten our business model.
The decisive factors for us are the guidelines of the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which was set up by 
the G20’s Financial Stability Board. These guidelines create a coher-
ent framework for voluntary and consistent reporting of an entity’s 
climate-related financial risks and opportunities. The current 
Volkswagen Group Sustainability Report includes for the second 
time a reference table with the five topics recommended by the 
TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, key indicators and 
targets.

MAKING DECARBONIZATION MEASURABLE
In the decarbonization index (DCI), we have a meaningful measuring 
instrument that makes our progress and interim results in this area 
public and verifiable. The DCI is calculated based on the CO2 emis-
sions over the entire life cycle of the brands of the Europe (EU 27, UK, 
Norway and Iceland), China and US regions that manufacture pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles. This means the use phase 
is calculated on the basis of 200,000 km and with reference to re-
gion-specific fleet values without legal flexibilities. The intensity of 
the CO2 emissions from the electricity used to charge the electric ve-
hicles is also calculated on the basis of region-specific energy mixes. 
Maintenance of the vehicles is not taken into account here. Our vehi-
cle life cycle assessments, which are used as the data basis for the cal-
culation of the supply-chain and recycling emissions, are verified by 
an external and independent body in accordance with the ISO 14040 
standard. The DCI calculation methodology is adjusted depending 
on internal and external requirements, such as new test cycles for 
fleet emissions. In order to present a methodologically consistent 
time series, published DCI values can therefore also be adjusted to 
the new methodology and thus changed. By 2025, the DCI is to be re-
duced by 30% compared with the base year 2015. The DCI value was 
43.0 tonnes CO2/vehicle on average in the reporting year. In com-
parison to the value reported in 2019, this means an increase of 
0.2 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle, taking account of the new basis of the 
data – supply chain emissions in 2020 are calculated using a region- 
specific data set.
STEERING OF GROUP-WIDE CLIMATE PROTECTION ACTIVITIES
The Group Steering Committee for Sustainability bears the main 
responsibility for climate protection as the highest body below the 
Board of Management. Product and portfolio topics are managed 
by the Group Steering Committee for CO2. The Group Board of 
Management is informed about Group- and product-related green-
house gas emissions at least twice a year and makes key decisions 
on topics relevant to climate protection.
The program applies to the entire Group, to all brands and regions. 
The Group Steering Committee for Sustainability steers the pro-
gram and objectives. The Decarbonization Project Center that we 
founded ourselves and which includes experts from all brands and 
departments is responsible for implementation. We use a prede-
fined process overseen by the management of the Decarbonization 
Project Center to check measures with which we can achieve the 
objective of decarbonization. All production locations and the 
brands and regions have prepared decarbonization roadmaps. The 
degree of achievement of our targets is measured with a tracking 
system. If we miss the target, we will implement corrective measures.
We have also established an internal mechanism for financially 
steering decarbonization, in which we have so far operated with an 
abatement cost limit of €20 per tonne of CO2. The abatement cost 
limit is reviewed annually on the basis of target achievement and 
adjusted by a resolution of the Board of Management.
The Volkswagen Group has an internal CO2 fund that proportional-
ly funds projects around the world that make a contribution to re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions and are transferable to as many 
sites, brands and companies as possible. €25 million per year is cur-
rently available for this. At the end of the 2020 reporting year, it 
was possible to report a number of successful projects. These in-
cluded, for example, measures for efficient LED lighting, modern-
ized heat supply and cooling at the sites or also optimized washing 
and drying processes in production and components. In other busi-
ness areas, projects range from the use of renewable energies for 
rail transport by Logistics through supporting air capturing proj-
ects in Iceland to carrying out ReFood projects to make company 
restaurants more sustainable. New projects with a volume of over 
€13 million have already been decided for 2021 – for example, the 
use of machine learning in air conditioning or projects that address 
the reduction of CO2 as early as in product creation.
TRANSPARENCY ON CO2 EMISSIONS AND ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION
Every year, we calculate the Group’s carbon footprint with the 
Scope 1–3 inventory. On this basis, we can determine the success of 
our measures and identify other areas for action. In order to reduce 
Group-wide CO2 emissions, we are beginning by making improve-
ments at our own production locations (Scope 1–2). Our most effec-
tive lever for reducing our global carbon footprint is to optimize 
CO2 emissions from our vehicle fleet.
Additional Group CO2 offsetting projects are not shown. In the re-
porting year, these had a volume of around 1.24 million t CO2.
In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Re-
sources Institute (WRI), we are reporting CO2 emissions for 13 out 
of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories in 2020. According to this, around 
16.6% of all Scope 3 emissions are in the “Purchased goods and ser-
vices” emissions category and 76.2% in the “Use phase” emissions 
categories (well to wheel). Fleet values without legal flexibilities are 
used to calculate the use-phase emissions in the DCI and in the 
Scope 3 GHG Inventory.
The calculation of CO2 emissions in the use phase of the Scope 3 
GHG Inventory is based on a Group fleet value representing the 
global passenger cars and light commercial vehicles fleet in the 
three major regions (Europe [EU 27, UK, Norway and Iceland], the 
USA and China). In order to provide a picture that is as complete as 
possible, we also collect data on emissions in this category that are 
produced during the production and transportation of fuels (“well 
to tank” emissions).
48
D E C A R B O N I Z AT I O N
The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (exclud-
ing Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 99.9g CO2/km¹ 
(New European Driving Cycle, NEDC) in the reporting year in ac-
cordance with the statutory measurement bases. This was about 
20% below the prior-year figure. At 0.8g CO2/km, the value fell just 
short of the CO2 pool established together with other manufactur-
ers. Owing to delays in product launches and contrary to the origi-
nal planning, it was not possible to achieve the target despite sig-
nificant improvements compared with 2019. As small-volume 
manufacturers, the Lamborghini and Bentley brands are each con-
sidered to have an independent fleet for the purposes of European 
CO2 legislation, and each was above its individual target. The regu-
lation of fleet emissions in the United States is different from regu-
lation in Europe – for example, in terms of the underlying test pro-
cess; the period of evaluation, which corresponds to the vehicles’ 
model year rather than the calendar year; and the period for com-
pensating for any CO2 breaches, which is three model years. In fis-
cal year 2020, we complied with the regulations that apply to our 
greenhouse gas account in the United States, subject to any notifi-
cation otherwise by the authorities.
DECARBONIZATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND CLIMATE-
FRIENDLY BATTERY PRODUCTION
We are tackling the challenge that higher CO2 emissions initially 
arise in the supply chain during the transition to electric mobility 
and the shares of the use phase shift to production. The CO2 emis-
sions in manufacturing an electric vehicle are – from raw material 
extraction to handover to the customer – roughly twice as high as 
with a vehicle with a combustion engine. This is because of the dif-
ficulty of raw material extraction and the energy-intensive process-
es in manufacturing batteries, which are also used in our supply 
chain.
To achieve our climate-protection targets, the procurement pro-
cesses within the Group’s organizational structures and processes 
are currently under continuous development. In order to encour-
age measures for reducing greenhouse gases among suppliers, we 
systematically identify the biggest sources of emissions along the 
supply chain in a component-related way by means of life cycle as-
sessments. In the reporting year, roadmaps were developed with 
our suppliers in numerous workshops in order to define measures 
for reducing CO2. For example, the Volkswagen Group is in close 
communication with all the major steel manufacturers in order to 
accelerate the switch to carbon-neutral products. All suppliers of 
high-voltage batteries are contractually obliged to use certified en-
ergy from renewable sources in their production. Suppliers must 
provide proof of this before the award of the contract. CO2 emis-
sions in battery manufacturing are therefore falling significantly. 
Thus, in connection with improved battery technologies, the new 
ID.3, for example, manages to emit almost 50% less CO2 per kilowatt 
hour (kWh) of battery capacity than the e-Golf.
We founded a 50/50 joint venture with Swedish company Northvolt 
AB in 2019 to set up a factory for the production of lithium-ion bat-
teries. Production is due to begin at the start of 2024. The annual 
performance of the battery factory to begin with should be 16 gig a-
watt hours. So as to be able to calculate the potential of battery re-
cycling, Volkswagen Group Components set up an initial pilot facil-
ity for battery recycling in Salzgitter that will begin operations at 
the start of 2021. 
 
 Circular Economy
Scaling battery production and intermediate products means fur-
ther improvement is expected in the future.
 
 Responsibility in Supply Chains and Business
We extend the responsibility for the environmental effects of our 
vehicles to our suppliers along the whole value chain. We have 
therefore been actively involved in the CDP Supply Chain Program 
(SCP) since 2015 and were included in the “supplier engagement 
leader on climate change” category in 2020, which is only achieved 
by 7% of all participating companies. We were given an A grade for 
our supply chain engagement in 2020. In 2020, we surveyed 239 
suppliers as part of the SCP regarding responsibility for our climate 
and water. That is equivalent to more than 63% of our production- 
related procurement spending (excluding services, Volkswagen 
Brazil and Scania). According to our suppliers’ self-assessments, 
they reduced their overall emissions to a total of 9.26 million 
tonnes of CO2, compared 8.05 million tonnes of CO2 in the previous 
year. The participating suppliers put the proportion of renewable 
energy at 62%. Since 2016, the CDP has included science-based tar-
gets (SBTs) in the questionnaire. 50% of our answering suppliers 
have already set SBTs or have undertaken to set such targets. Based 
on the information in the questionnaire, suppliers covering more 
than 63% of our production-related procurement spending report 
via the CDP Supply Chain Program (SCP).
E-MOBILITY AS A KEY FACTOR OF DECARBONIZATION
The Volkswagen Group has launched one of the biggest e-offensives 
in the automotive sector. In order to achieve the statutory require-
ments for CO2 fleet emissions, in 2025 the Volkswagen brand wants, 
for example, to sell more than one million e-cars per year globally. 
The plan is also to increase the proportion of the fleet that is electric 
to at least 40% by 2030. The market launch of the completely newly 
developed, all-electric ID. model family took place in 2020. We now 
have attractive products for e-mobility with the ID.3 and ID.4 mod-
els, the Audi e-tron and the Porsche Taycan.
The new electric vehicles are manufactured at eight sites in Europe, 
China and the US. The modular electric drive matrix (MEB) serves 
as the technical backbone of the e-offensive and is used in many 
more of our electric models. Not only will the cost of e-mobility be 
¹ Subject to confirmation of the CO2 data in the official publication by the European Commission.

D E C A R B O N I Z AT I O N
significantly reduced with the associated economies of scale, the 
MEB will also enable the extensive decarbonization potential that 
is associated with this technology to be tapped for all brands and 
models.
Compared to vehicles with an internal combustion engine, electric 
vehicles have the environmental advantage that they produce no lo-
cal emissions during use. Our calculations show that the current 
carbon footprint of electric vehicles is already better on average in 
Europe in most markets than comparable gasoline or diesel vehicles 
over the entire life cycle too.
THE CLIMATE FOOTPRINT OF THE ID.3 OVER ITS ENTIRE 
LIFE CYCLE
In order to underpin this in particular for our electric offensive’s 
flagship, the ID.3, we have produced a detailed climate footprint for 
this vehicle type in the reporting year and had it certified. The gen-
eral framework for this is a detailed, ISO-standardized life cycle as-
sessment, which we carry out on products as part of our environ-
mental management. This means that we are able to identify 
serious environmental impacts (hotspots) in the respective stages 
of the life cycle and set about developing suitable improvement 
measures with the greatest possible effect.
We are currently particularly observing the climate effect in the 
impact categories. CO2 and all other emissions relevant to the cli-
mate are recorded here and converted into CO2 equivalents. 
Volkswagen AG commissioned TÜV NORD CERT Umweltgutachter 
GmbH as an independent external body to carry out the critical re-
view of this life cycle assessment study in accordance with the ap-
plicable standards DIN EN ISO 14040 and DIN EN ISO 14044. In ac-
cordance with the standard, the manufacturing phase from raw 
material extraction, the use phase comprising use for transporting 
passengers over 200,000 km in the WLTP driving cycle to the recy-
cling of the Golf 8 and the ID.3 were used as the framework.
On the basis of the ISO- standardized methodology, around 5,000 
components were analyzed and 40,000 processes in all life cycle 
phases were carefully examined. For each process step of a compo-
nent, its emissions were calculated with special software on the ba-
sis of standardized average values. For particularly energy-inten-
sive manufacturing steps, such as battery-cell production, for the 
ID.3 we used our respective suppliers’ specific data instead of aver-
age values.
The components and processes with the biggest carbon footprint 
included the battery cells, the steel for automotive bodies, produc-
tion at the sites and logistics. Beyond the measures already imple-
mented (e.g. the use of green energy for cell production), additional 
reduction potential can be seen in the use of aluminum, in the lev-
els of the battery supply chain that are further upstream or with re-
gard to the use of recycled material, such as in the form of second-
ary raw materials from the recycling of lithium ion batteries.
The bottom line shows the carbon footprint over the entire life cy-
cle: even without offsetting the remaining CO2 emissions in pro-
duction, the ID.3 has a CO2 advantage over a comparable model 
with an internal combustion engine – and not just when charged 
using green energy but even when charged with the usual Europe-
an energy mix.

DELIVERY PROMISE OF A CLIMATE-NEUTRAL FOOTPRINT
We give our ID.3 customers the delivery promise that we will deliv-
er them a vehicle with a climate-neutral footprint. We also want to 
enable virtually carbon neutral individual mobility over the entire 
life cycle for them. We achieve this by means of various instru-
ments: We reduce CO2 emissions by increasing energy efficiency 
and using renewably generated energy at our Zwickau plant. We 
contractually obligate our battery suppliers for the ID.3 to only use 
electricity from renewable sources. We offset remaining emissions 
arising from production through comprehensive, certified climate 
protection measures. This includes a wind farm in India and a proj-
ect to protect tropical forests on the Indonesian island of Borneo. 
All the climate protection projects meet the highest international 
standards.
In view of the fact that around half of the CO2 emissions are ac-
counted for by electricity used to charge the vehicle in the use 
phase, the provision of clean energy from renewable sources is of 
overriding importance for the ID.3’s climate footprint. By supply-
ing energy from renewable sources via our subsidiary Elli (Electric 
Life), we can offer our customers the option of being emission-free 
in the use phase too.
RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR VEHICLE USE
Through the subsidiary Elli, Volkswagen offers 100% CO2-free 
Volkswagen Naturstrom electricity to private households with or 
without electric vehicles in Germany. It is generated by wind, solar 
and hydroelectric power plants from Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland.
Since the market launch of the ID.3, the Volkswagen brand has of-
fered a complete package for conveniently and sustainably charg-
ing e-vehicles. The ID.Charger is a wallbox for charging at home. 
The electric vehicle can be operated emission-free with certified 
Volkswagen Naturstrom® from renewable sources. All these servic-
es and products are distributed by Volkswagen’s subsidiary Elli, 
which accelerates the progress of the topic of charging within the 
Group.
This means Elli is tapping a completely new field of business for the 
Group, in which the energy and mobility focus areas grow closer 
together via electric mobility. Our aim is to make Elli the first pro-
vider on the market to offer drivers and fleet managers of electric 
vehicles charging both at home and at the workplace. In order to set 
up fast charging infrastructure, Volkswagen founded the joint ven-
ture IONITY with other OEMs, which is setting up around 400 fast 
charging stations on major highways across Europe.
In addition, the Volkswagen Group has adopted a pioneering strate-
gy for renewably generated electricity in the use phase of electric 
vehicles. As a result, we connect the transportation and energy 
transformation. Through establishing strategic partnerships with 
energy suppliers and the targeted support of the expansion of re-
newable energy generation beyond existing expansion plans, we 
want to feed additional electricity from renewable sources into the 
grid. The Volkswagen Group thus has the clear objective that the 
consumption of electricity to charge its electric vehicles should be 
covered by renewable energy, irrespective of where and by means 
of which option the vehicle is charged. In this way, we want to en-
able our customers to be mobile with largely carbon-neutral electric 
vehicles.
CLIMATE PROTECTION IN MANUFACTURING
In the last ten years, Volkswagen has increased vehicle production 
from 7.3 million to 8.7 million vehicles (an increase of 19.7%). Al-
though absolute energy consumption increased by 11.5%, at the 
same time, absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 12%. 
Volkswagen wants to continue this trend and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in production by 30% in absolute terms compared to 
2018 by 2030. Key to this are increasing energy efficiency and 
switching to an emission-free power supply. The strategy for re new-
able energy also covers the production sites. For example, we will 
gradually increase the proportion of renewable energy in the elec-
tricity purchased externally for production to 100% by 2030 – ini-
tially completely in the European Union in 2023, then worldwide in 
2030 – with the exception of China. For China, the feasibility of the 
plan and the availability of green energy is currently being re-
viewed. Currently, the proportion of renewable energy in the Group 
as a whole is 45.6%. 100% of electricity is already obtained from re-
newable energy at 53 Group sites. We are also strengthening our ap-
proach with a sourcing strategy that provides for the undifferenti-
ated sourcing of energy for all new contracts only with 
corresponding proof of origin (Energy Attribute Certificates) where 
the particular electricity market offers this option.
When supplying our own energy, we continue to focus on re new-
able energy. Most of the electricity for the Volkswagen Group’s Ger-
man production sites that is not produced by the site itself is thus 
carbon-neutral Volkswagen Naturstrom electricity, i.e. renewable 
energy. Approval for building and operating certified wind power 
facilities producing 12.8 MW at the MAN Salzgitter site was granted 
in 2017 as part of a public procedure. The project was confirmed in 
the Federal Network Agency’s EEG Tendering Process 2018. The four 
wind turbines were ordered from the manufacturer. The commis-
sioning of the plant began at the end of 2019. After delivery was 
taken of the equipment, it was put into permanent operation in 
2020.
51
D E C A R B O N I Z AT I O N
In addition, Volkswagen is working at full speed on advancing ener-
gy-efficiency projects in its 118 production facilities. Across the 
Group, 1,236 measures for saving energy were implemented in 
2020 alone. For example, the conversion of the power plants in 
Wolfsburg from coal to gas begun in 2019 is expected to reduce 
emissions from operations by 60% from 2023, which is equivalent 
to an annual saving of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2. This is being 
achieved through increased efficiency of the combined cycle gas 
turbine power plants and use of natural gas in the future instead of 
coal. The modernization reduces the CO2 emissions of the Group's 
production facilities by a total of about 15%.
CARBON-NEUTRAL PLANTS
Production in Brussels and Győr by Audi and at the Volkswagen 
ID.3 site in Zwickau has a carbon-neutral footprint. The electric en-
ergy for the production of the ID.3 is covered exclusively by our 
own highly efficient cogeneration via combined heat and power 
plants and Volkswagen Naturstrom. Efficiency measures in produc-
tion include, for example, optimized thermal afterburning in the 
paint line, frequency-controlled fans and the use of energy-effi-
cient air compressors. Production at the Porsche site at Zuffenhaus-
en also has a carbon-neutral footprint and only uses energy from 
renewable sources. These are exclusively run on biogas, which is 
obtained from biodegradable waste and residual materials. The site 
also uses biogas in the manufacturing process. The Group’s head of-
fice and the main Bentley Motors plant in Crewe, England, also 
work in a climate-neutral way and have a corresponding certificate 
in accordance with the PAS 2060 Carbon Neutrality Standard. All of 
Bentley’s electrical power is either generated through solar panels 
on site or purchased as certified green energy. In addition, the sites 
in Dresden, Vrchlabí and Santa Agata also already operate with a 
carbon neutral footprint.
“GOTOZERO IMPACT LOGISTICS”
In order to achieve the climate targets and contribute to the decar-
bonization of the Group, Volkswagen Group Logistics is working to-
gether with colleagues from Brand Logistics in the goTozero Impact 
Logistics initiative. Continuous optimization of the transport net-
work and the logistics processes reduces environmental impacts 
such as emissions. In addition, the use of new, low-emission tech-
nologies in the transportation of production materials and fin-
ished vehicles is being reviewed and pushed.
The measures the Volkswagen Group has taken to achieve car-
bon-neutral logistics going forward include moving shipments 
from road to rail and almost complete avoidance of CO2 through 
the use of green electricity in rail transport in Germany in collabo-
ration with Deutsche Bahn AG. 
Another example for the use of rail as a low-emission mode of 
transport is transporting battery systems from the Braunschweig 
component site to the Zwickau plant, which is the production loca-
tion for the ID.3 and ID.4. The battery modules are also shipped by 
train from the supplier in Wrocław, Poland, to Braunschweig.
In addition, Volkswagen Group Logistics has now put the world’s 
first two roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ships of this size powered by lique-
fied natural gas into service for vehicle transport across the North 
Atlantic. Their main environmental advantage is the low-pollution 
drive system.
OFFSETTING UNAVOIDABLE CO2 EMISSIONS
For as long as we cannot avoid CO2 emissions in all locations and 
renewable energy cannot be used everywhere, we will offset the re-
maining greenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain, produc-
tion and logistics for MEB vehicles in Europe. We offset unavoidable 
CO2 emissions through climate protection projects with the high-
est certification standards, such as the Verified Carbon Standard 
(VCS), the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB) or 
the Gold Standard. For the quality assurance of offsetting projects, 
we have developed a comprehensive scoring model and rate the 
projects with regard to compliance with standards, credibility, site 
selection, project size and the contribution to achieving the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. One important criterion 
for this support: the CO2 saving must be precisely quantified and 
provable. A committee of members of top management makes the 
decision on supporting the projects.
The Volkswagen Group will continue to systematically pursue the 
course it has adopted to offset unavoidable emissions in 2021 and 
beyond. To this end, we plan both to participate in existing trans-
portation projects and to develop our own climate protection proj-
ects in order to make a contribution to overcoming the climate 
crisis.
PARTICIPATING IN EMISSIONS TRADING AND CARBON PRICING
Thirty-two of our Group locations participate in European emis-
sions trading and thus comply with a legal requirement of the EU. 
For 2020, a total of 918,583 emissions certificates were allocated to 
the Volkswagen Group free of charge (83,591 fewer than in the pre-
vious year). The European Commission is already planning to make 
further changes to emissions trading when the fourth trading peri-
od begins (from 2021). These could lead to a tightening of the sys-
tem and thus to price increases for the certificates. In addition to 
the EU member states, other countries in which the Volkswagen 
Group has production locations are also considering introducing 
an emissions trading system. Eight corresponding pilot projects are 
52
D E C A R B O N I Z AT I O N
running in China, for example, although they have not so far af-
fected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government plans to 
convert the regional pilots into a national emissions trading sys-
tem by 2025. Initially, this affects only the power generation sector; 
a gradual expansion is being planned.
The European CEO Alliance, which we co-founded, proposes that a 
predictably growing minimum floor price and appropriate devel-
opment of the EU Emissions Trading System to cover all sectors 
should be considered, maintaining competitiveness of European 
companies. Revenues from the emissions trading system and na-
tional environmental taxes should be channeled toward sus tain-
able innovation and industrial decarbonization. In this context, we 
welcome the planned EU innovation fund. While price signals for 
CO2 should primarily be triggered by the ETS, a reform of energy 
taxation and its directives should take the climate impact of all en-
ergy carriers into account to support decarbonization of the energy 
market.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY
The finite nature of natural resources and the social and environ-
mental consequences of mining raw materials make uncoupling 
economic growth from resource consumption and the develop-
ment of a circular economy key sustainability topics. On an inter-
national and national level, politicians have taken up these chal-
lenges and set themselves the goal of regulating markets more 
strictly in the future in order to drive the transformation toward 
resource efficiency and a circular economy. This is accompanied by 
ambitious programs and support measures. For example, the crea-
tion of a circular economy is a key component of the European Un-
ion’s Green Deal. This has already been concretized by an action 
plan that is intended to set the framework for a broad range of ac-
tion areas in the years ahead: from electronics and IT through food, 
plastic and textiles to packaging and waste management. Sus tain-
ably manufactured products for sustainable use are intended to en-
able citizens to share in the advantages of the circular economy and 
make responsible consumption decisions. Growing awareness of 
circular economy issues is also shown by financial market players, 
who increasingly include companies’ performance in this area in 
their evaluations by using ratings and rankings.
Against this background, companies face increasing pressure as a 
result of their stakeholders’ expectations. They also recognize ex-
tensive opportunities to tap into new business models and markets 
or to give themselves an edge in the competition for limited re-
sources with changed use concepts.
Production of vehicles requires many raw materials. The Volkswagen 
Group has already developed plans for recycling and reusing vehicle 
parts in order to reduce its own environmental footprint and culti-
vate circular business models. In particular, digitalization has re-
cently further boosted these efforts. An additional driver of the cir-
cular economy is the ongoing decarbonization of the Volkswagen 
Group: the growing use of secondary materials and the establish-
ment of closed materials loops help to significantly reduce our CO2 
emissions. 
Like with our decarbonization strategy, we are currently still work-
ing on a holistic strategic approach for the area of the circular econ-
omy. Conservation of resources along the entire life cycle of our 
products and mobility solutions is, however, already a key part of 
our strategy: in the “goTOzero” concept, the Volkswagen Group sets 
itself the target of further improving its resource efficiency and 
promoting approaches to reuse and recycling in the areas of mate-
rials, energy and water. By 2025, the Group plans to have reduced 
the production-related environmental impact with respect to CO2, 
energy, water, waste and volatile organic compounds by 45% per 
vehicle compared to 2010.
 
 Environmental Management
NEW STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY
In 2020, we decided to intensify our efforts for a transition to a 
loop-oriented and resource-conserving way of doing business and 
to combine our projects and measures into a holistic approach. On 
the way to this, we are in close communication with our stakehold-
ers and also with legislators and actors in politics and society. We 
also rely on alliances with various partners, such as suppliers, plant 
manufacturers or the recycling sector.
In the course of our materiality analysis, we defined the circular 
economy as a focus area of the sustainability narrative. We already 
have a broad foundation here with our “goTOzero” concept and a 
wide variety of activities at brand level. At the same time, we are 
aware that it requires a new consistent and strategic approach to be 
developed with ambitions, targets and KPIs and the implementa-
tion of corresponding structures and processes at Group level.
Similarly to our strategic approach to decarbonization, we want to 
anchor the circular economy action area uniformly throughout the 
Group and manage it over the entire life cycle of our products. In 
the reporting year, we started developing a strategy for a circular 
economy with the involvement of all the brands and the relevant 
business areas. The strategy is intended to include binding objec-
tives, robust parameters and implementation measures. It has thus 
been decided to initially focus on achieving the following ambition 
by 2030:
Volkswagen is known for its particularly efficient use of resources 
and uses the principles of circular economy for its business models.
We are currently in the process of putting the objectives in concrete 
terms. The Volkswagen Group is planning to add further KPIs that 
indicate progress in the area of the circular economy to the existing 
KPIs (DCI, reduction of the environmental impact of production).
The most important measures that we want to take to implement 
the circular-economy strategy include further clarifying targets 
and indicators and also realizing circular business models for the 
most important components and materials, such as battery, steel, 
aluminum or plastics. We also want to strengthen communication 
around the topic of a circular economy.
We are currently developing our own working structure at Group 
level for managing the activities. This builds on the work of com-
mittees such as the Group Steering Committee for the Environ-
ment and Energy, the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability, 
the Group Steering Committee for Product Recycling and the 
Group Working Committee for Environment Product.
The reporting on the measures implemented in 2020 is still based 
on the established approach for resource efficiency in production 
and for use of sustainable and recycled materials. Nevertheless, we 
are already guided by the various stages of the life cycle of our 
products in the order of the topics and initiatives dealt with.

OUR GOAL: CLOSED MATERIAL LOOPS
We are stepping up efforts to use materials loops in our production 
processes. When selecting raw materials, we opt for recycled ones 
obtained from production waste or end-of-life products. When de-
veloping new vehicles, we pay attention to the recyclability of the 
required materials, using high-quality recycled material and avoid-
ing pollutants. Under the European Directive on end-of-life vehicles, 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles must be 85% re cyc-
able and 95% recoverable at end of life. All our vehicles registered in 
Europe comply with these standards.
In order to calculate how much of a complete vehicle is recycled, we 
determine the materials of all relevant components in the vehicle 
and their recycled materials content and add these together. Relia-
ble information straight from suppliers and sector-specific associa-
tion data are essential for this.
The Aluminum Closed Loop Project, with which a closed loop for 
aluminum was achieved beyond Company boundaries for the first 
time in the Neckarsulm plant in 2017, is an example of our ap-
proach. The waste from aluminum sheet-metal parts from the 
press shop is delivered directly back to the suppliers, who can recy-
cle the scrap and use it to produce new material that Audi then uses 
again in the press shop. In this way, Audi not only saves energy and 
avoids CO2 emissions, but also reduces the quantity of primary raw 
materials needed. In addition to the plant in Neckarsulm, the Ingol-
stadt plant joined the Aluminum Closed Loop process in January 
2020; the plant in Győr is set to follow in 2021. The process itself 
and the resulting CO2 saving have been verified by independent 
third parties. This process has already made it possible to avoid 
more than 525,000 tonnes of CO2 in the Group’s carbon footprint 
since 2017.
USE OF RENEWABLE RAW MATERIALS AND MATERIALS 
PRODUCED WITH LOW EMISSIONS
In order to reduce our resource consumption, we rely on raw mate-
rials from renewable and nonrenewable sources when manufactur-
ing our vehicles. Wherever possible, our Group brands use re new-
able raw materials such as the natural fibers flax, cotton, wood and 
cellulose. Such materials can be used if they comply with all the 
technical requirements and perform better than conventional ma-
terials over the life cycle. In addition, our strict sustainability 
standards naturally apply for our suppliers.
We take advantage of new opportunities in body construction 
where we improve existing products or design new ones in the in-
terests of functionality, quality, safety and environmental compat-
ibility. Intelligent lightweight construction is the guiding principle 
here. For volume models, we use hot-formed, high-strength steel. 
Although energy consumption in production is higher, the lighter 
vehicle body allows a reduction in CO2 emissions and thus an im-
provement in the overall environmental impact of the product.
PILOT PROJECT FOR BATTERY RECYCLING
The Volkswagen Group has bundled end-to-end responsibility for 
the battery – from cell development to recycling – in Volkswagen 
Group Components. The aim is to close the material loop for the 
battery, to help safeguard raw materials by doing this and to sup-
port sustainability goals. Specifically, the consumption of primary 
materials and a battery’s carbon footprint can both be reduced. To 
realize this closed loop, following the battery’s use phase in the cus-
tomer’s vehicle, the battery is given a second life in order to extend 
its life, for example as an energy storage unit in stationary applica-
tions. After that, the battery materials should be reclaimed again 
through a specially developed recycling process.
The focus of the battery recycling is primarily on the metals nickel 
and cobalt. There are already established technologies here to re-
claim these materials by furnace. By contrast, the Group Compo-
nents recycling process uses low-energy, mechanical processing 
with subsequent hydrometallurgy. The battery is recycled in sever-
al process steps through mechanical crushing, sieving and filtering 
so that a partner can process the black powder into new cathode 
material by wet chemical processes in the next step. Significantly 
less energy is needed due to the lower temperatures. The mechani-
cal crushing also enables more procedural freedom than current 
technologies, meaning that lithium and, in the future, also addi-
tional materials, such as battery electrolytes or graphite, can be 
specifically reclaimed. As part of dismantling the battery system, 
large quantities of aluminum, steel, copper and electronic compo-
nents, which are fed into separate recycling channels, are also 
made available.
A pilot plant for battery recycling was started up at the Salzgitter 
site at the end of 2020 in order to test, validate and further develop 
these processes. Keeping in close communication with Battery Cell 
Development means we will be able to respond to future techno-
logical leaps. Experience from recycling, for example in the pro-
cess for dismantling battery systems, can be used in the long term 
to influence the development of future batteries in such a way as to 
facilitate the later recycling process.
56
C I R C U L A R  E C O N O M Y
The pilot plant in Salzgitter should process and recycle the accruing 
batteries of all Group brands from launch. The largest volume 
comes from internal sources within the Group, for example, of pro-
totype vehicles or test batteries. Higher volumes of battery returns 
are not expected until the end of the 2020s or the start of the 2030s, 
and any second life use may postpone this period. The work on the 
pilot plant means we will be prepared for recycling the batteries de-
livered at this point.
RESPONSIBLE USE OF WATER
The supply chain, in particular obtaining and processing raw mate-
rials, is responsible for the greater part of our water use. Because we 
cannot influence these aspects directly, we concentrate on our pro-
duction sites. Of all freshwater that we use, 51.0% (around 16.7 mil-
lion m³) is used by sites in risk zones, i.e. regions with water short-
ages, such as Mexico. The closed-loop circulation or recirculation of 
cooling and process water means the need for freshwater and the 
quantity of waste water can be reduced considerably. The San José 
Chiapa (Mexico) Audi site, which can be considered a waste-water-free 
site due to closed-loop circulation, provides a good example of this.
As part of our “goTOzero” concept, our sustainable water manage-
ment focuses on the following areas of activity:
• Reduction of fresh water consumption and efficiency in water 
use, particularly in water stress areas
• Minimization of pollution and no worsening of the environmen-
tal and chemical status in the receiving waters (waters into 
which the treated waste water is introduced)
• Increased soil and groundwater protection when using water-pol-
luting substances
We manage water-saving processes at our Group’s locations during 
production in line with Group-wide specifications. In addition, 
Volkswagen supports the CDP Water Disclosure Project (WDP) 
through the transparency of its water management. In 2020, we 
were given an A for our sustainable water management in the WDP 
ranking. Due to our growing production figures and the integra-
tion of new sites in recent years, our Group’s absolute freshwater 
use has increased in recent years. The amount of freshwater used 
per vehicle decreased by 17.7% per vehicle from 2010 to 2020 
thanks to a range of recycling measures and the introduction of 
manufacturing processes requiring little water.
The amount of waste water produced is in line with the amount of 
freshwater that we use. Differences in quantities between fresh 
and waste water are the result of evaporation in cooling towers and 
during the manufacturing process.
SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT
Our waste strategy aims to reduce the quantity of waste per unit 
produced and to reuse unavoidable waste to create high-quality 
materials, i.e. to close loops. The focus is on:
• Avoiding waste creation by optimizing production and auxiliary 
processes and increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency)
• Reducing the quantity of waste produced by processing waste at 
sites
• Prioritizing the reuse of waste and reducing the quantity of 
waste that needs to be disposed of
In order to optimize our management of waste, we are increasingly 
using digital waste management systems in all German and a 
number of international production locations of the Volkswagen, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, Audi and MAN brands. 
They make it easier to control waste management processes and fa-
cilitate state control of the disposal of hazardous waste (electronic 
government).
In order to monitor waste management and recycling processes, we 
carry out regular cross-site, cross-brand and cross-OEM waste dispos-
al audits in Germany and the rest of Europe. In addition, the audi-
tors receive further training and hold regular discussions to ensure 
that they have a common understanding of the quality require-
ments associated with waste disposal services, to carry out audits 
of consistently high quality and to allow other OEMs and suppliers 
to take advantage of the results.
We reuse waste from manufacturing, logistics, workshops and 
technical development to produce high-quality materials. Our Pro-
curement Division has established a Group-wide system for recov-
ering waste materials that can generate income, for example paper, 
plastics, wood or metal.
Under the umbrella of the Zero Impact Factory initiative, we are in-
tensifying our efforts to avoid plastic waste with the Zero Plastic 
Waste project. Together with the Group brands and various depart-
ments from environmental protection, logistics and the produc-
tion trades, a “roundtable” was created in mid-2020. This working 
group specifically looks for alternatives for the plastic packaging 
currently used. We test innovative options for avoiding plastics 
here and are guided, wherever possible, by the Group sites’ best 
practices.

VEHICLE QUALITY AND REPLACEMENT PARTS AS BUILDING 
BLOCKS OF RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
Overall, the aim of the high quality focus with a low need for repair 
is to give our vehicles long lives in the use phase, thus making an 
important contribution to resource efficiency.
Volkswagen, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Audi, SEAT and 
ŠKODA also take back many used parts from engines, transmissions 
or electronics because they contain valuable raw materials. These 
car parts are industrially remanufactured and tested and can then 
be used in another car again. When they need a repair, our custom-
ers can decide whether the repair shop should install a completely 
new replacement part – or whether it is preferable to use a Genuine 
Remanufactured Part. These offer as-new quality but at a much 
lower price than new parts. Using these parts saves large amounts 
of raw materials, energy and CO2. For a large number of car parts, 
we quantify these effects in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) carried 
out in accordance with ISO 14040. For example, we calculated the 
environmental impacts of a newly manufactured Volkswagen MQ 
250 five-speed transmission and compared them with those of a 
Genuine Remanufactured Part. The LCA revealed a 33% reduction 
in energy consumption and a drop of approximately 28% in CO2 
emissions for the remanufactured part. Ozone impacts are also 
28% lower compared with the new part. We also offer our commer-
cial vehicle segment brands Scania and MAN additional services in 
the field of reuse. Customers can purchase tested and used Genuine 
Parts, particularly engines and transmissions. At MAN, customers 
can also have cabs from all the product lines remanufactured and 
repaired on request.

60 Responsibility in Our Group
64 Responsibility in Our Supply Chain
RESPONSIBILITY 
IN SUPPLY CHAINS 
AND BUSINESS
59
The Volkswagen Group pursues the vision of enabling sustainable 
mobility for generations to come. For us, living up to our legal, so-
cial and environmental responsibility not just in our own Group 
but also in our supply chains is therefore a given.
In 2020, the Volkswagen Group identified the topic of responsibility 
in supply chains and business as a focus area of the sustainability 
narrative and thus as a clear strategic focus of action. We have thus 
formulated a clear ambition that we want to translate into lived 
corporate practice by 2030:
We are fully and entirely committed to our corporate responsibility in 
our business relationships and in our business units and at our sites. 
To this end, we are establishing a strong business and human rights 
management system.
This ambition results in concrete objectives in the field of human 
rights: in our supply chain, we want to effectively avoid ESG-related 
risks, including human rights risks, and ensure that 85% of our di-
rect business partners obtain an A in our sustainability rating by 
2025. By 2023, all entities that fall within the scope of compliance 
should have incorporated the topic of business and human rights 
in the compliance management system. We will manage and mea-
sure target achievement here through KPIs and support the achieve-
ment of targets with suitable measures and programs.
RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR GROUP
Policymakers and civil society increasingly demand that interna-
tional companies respect their duties of human rights due diligence. 
In numerous countries, these demands are leading to legislation: 
companies are required to comply with their duties of human 
rights due diligence within their sphere of influence – at their sites 
and in their business and supplier relationships. At the same time, 
investors and analysts are also using sustainability and compliance 
ratings to subject corporate actions in respect of human rights du-
ties to a systematic and increasingly strict assessment.
Not least due to the Group’s history, i.e. the use of forced labor in 
the Wolfsburg plant during the period of National Socialism and 
Volkswagen do Brasil’s cooperation with the military regime in 
Brazil, the Volkswagen Group takes its duties of human rights due 
diligence seriously. The Volkswagen Group has anchored human 
rights in its processes and policies independently from external ex-
pectations and legislation and has set these out in an agreement 
with employees – the Social Charter.
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND OUR OWN PRIORITIES
Our activities in the area of business and human rights are based 
on compliance with international frameworks and also efficient 
structures and management processes. Thus, we have oriented our-
selves in particular on:
• the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
which is codified in the International Covenant on Civil and 
 Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic, 
 Social and Cultural Rights,
• the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO),
• the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
• the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and
• the principles of the UN Global Compact.
The aim of the Volkswagen Group’s agreements with the Group Eu-
ropean Works Council and Global Group Works Council is to shape 
cooperative labor relations characterized by social harmony. They 
are intended to offer our employees certainty as regards their em-
ployee and human rights. These particularly include the prohibi-
tion of discrimination at work, child labor and forced labor.

The Volkswagen Group has laid down the respective key focal 
points, the so-called Salient Business & Human Rights Issues, in the 
business and human rights focus area in the three categories of 
employment rights, tolerance and security in the sense of the UN 
Guiding Principles: 
• Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
• No forced labor
• No child labor
• Good working conditions
• No involvement in any unlawful activities
• Guarantee of the security of people
• Tolerance towards different – ideological and religious – opinions 
and respectful expression of them
• No discrimination
• Diversity, protection of disadvantaged, particularly indigenous 
groups
Since 2019, the Volkswagen Group has had a coordinator for the 
business and human rights action area. The coordinator, who was 
appointed by the Group Board of Management, also manages the 
collaboration with the brands and regions.
CLEAR REQUIREMENTS IN THE CODE OF CONDUCT
Expectations of our employees and our Group-wide understanding 
of the observance of universal human rights are also set out in our 
Code of Conduct. The issue of human rights is covered in the chap-
ter on “Our responsibilities as a member of society.”
Our Code of Conduct and additional topic-related Group policies 
apply to all the Volkswagen Group’s employees around the world.
Employees of the Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies are 
trained to this end as part of the mandatory Code of Conduct train-
ing. In addition, there is in-depth training for business units with 
increased risk exposure. The international rollout of the Code of 
Conduct training continued within the Volkswagen Group in the 
reporting year. This will also be continued in 2021. Over and above 
the Code of Conduct, our human rights responsibility does not end 
at the factory gate. We also enter into dialog with our stakeholders: 
at Volkswagen Group Sustainability’s stakeholder dialog in Febru-
ary 2020, we presented our measures in the area of business and 
human rights to critical stakeholder groups, such as NGOs and hu-
man rights representatives, and critically discussed our measures 
with these groups. On this basis, we can further develop our com-
mitment in order to live up to our corporate responsibility for hu-
man rights even better.

Group policies create more precise specifications
With the revision of the “Participation Management of Noncon-
trolled Participations” Group policy and the adoption of the 
“Conducting Site Projects for Industrialization” Group policy, we 
also procedurally anchored the topic of business and human rights 
in site decisions and M&A projects.
1) Strategy: definition of our work priorities, “salient business and 
human rights issues.”
2) Policies: integration of the topic into strategic documents and 
Group policies, for example in the Code of Conduct and the Social 
Charter.
3) Processes and structures: risk-based approach in the context of 
systematic analysis and uniform Group-wide measures. BHR risk 
assessment and implementation of risk-specific measures.
4) Communication: reporting in the sustainability report, raising 
awareness of the topic through internal and external communi-
cation measures.
5) Training: basic training for all employees and extended training 
for employees from business units with increased risk exposure 
in the Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies.
6) Measuring impact & auditing: monitoring and continuous 
improvement.
7) Reporting: reporting and organizational feedback in the context 
of rankings.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN…
USING THE EXISTING COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR  BOOSTING BUSINESS & HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACCORDING TO UN PRINCIPLES
INTEGRATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO COMPLIANCE FURTHER 
BOOSTED
We implement our management approach throughout the Group: 
our controlled companies are included using the standardized in-
ternal compliance risk management processes (ICRA). In the case of 
noncontrolled companies (excluding Chinese joint ventures), an 
individual analysis is made in close cooperation with our respec-
tive company partners. We rely on the cooperation of these busi-
ness partners here. The Volkswagen Group has integrated the topic 
of business and human rights into the Group’s established compli-
ance management system. This is intended to achieve integration 
of the topic along the UN Elements of Human Rights Due Diligence.
62
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  I N  S U P P LY  C H A I N S  A N D  B U S I N E S S
Human rights risk analysis for the entire Group
The Volkswagen Group has 118 production sites worldwide, includ-
ing the Chinese joint venture production facilities. These are main-
ly in countries with a medium or high human rights risk. For ex-
ample, Group Compliance made detailed risk assessments for the 
field of human rights for 744 controlled companies of the 
Volkswagen Group around the world. 100% of our 744 controlled 
companies in a total of 83 countries were audited as a result. The 
human rights risk assessment is largely based on a correlation of 
country and business-area risks. The country risks are based on the 
Maplecroft index, a meta-index that draws on, among other things, 
more than 30 individual indices of international organizations – 
for example, the UN or the Business & Human Rights Resource Cen-
tre. The business-area risks include human-rights risks assessed in-
ternally within the Group and specific publicly available 
information, for example from the Corporate Human Rights 
Benchmark (CHRB).
The completion of this analysis means that we have assessed our 
business units’ gross human-rights risks and can allocate these to 
the low, medium and high categories. This means we are also aware 
of those with a high gross risk. We have agreed the results with the 
companies and had the companies confirm them. All companies 
were then sent risk-specific measures that they need to implement 
by the end of 2021. This will be audited by the group from 2022. In 
addition, the companies with a high gross risk will be assessed for 
their net risks in on-site audits from 2021.
We monitor the human rights situation in the markets in which we 
are active and refer in particular to the United Nations’ publicly 
available reports. The Volkswagen Group takes its responsibility as 
a business in the field of human rights very seriously. The work in 
our factories and sales companies around the world is based on our 
principles, such as respect for minorities, employee representation 
and social and labor standards. We also expect this of our local Chi-
nese business partners. 
POSITIONING IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
In addition to our organizational and procedural measures and ac-
tivities, we also create the necessary awareness for the topic of busi-
ness and human rights. For a start, we communicate about the top-
ic to our staff through our internal channels. Our Director of 
Integrity and Legal Affairs also makes her position known to the 
public and external stakeholders in interviews and media pieces.
In the last few years, a trend of also regulating the issue of business 
and human rights in national laws has been emerging in leading 
economic powers. Volkswagen, as a global business, also observes 
such national requirements that put international standards in 
concrete form. One example of this is the UK Modern Slavery Act 
2015: we publish a corresponding Group statement on this annual-
ly on our website.
In the reporting year, we have publicly stated our position on the 
cornerstones of a planned due diligence law as follows:
As an international business, the Volkswagen Group argues in favor 
of an EU regulation for the protection of human rights by enterpris-
es and their suppliers. Such a regulation should set a uniform 
standard that gives enterprises in the European Economic Area le-
gal certainty in their action area. Based on these premises, we 
therefore advocate an initially national regulation that gives indi-
vidual companies sufficient leeway for individual organization. In 
the interests of any due diligence law being as effective as possible, 
we favor the broadest scope possible: the more enterprises are di-
rectly obligated by law, the greater we think the chance of actual 
penetration of the entire supply chain is.
In addition, we think continuous dialog between those involved 
about principles and implementation issues is needed in differenti-
ating between the state’s duty to protect human rights and corpo-
rate human rights responsibility. For businesses, it is often chal-
lenging to obtain concrete and objective information enabling a 
comprehensive assessment of human rights situations. Concrete 
political support in obtaining information can be provided here.
In order to achieve further progress, we also seek cooperation with 
international organizations. Our involvement with econsense, the 
sustainability association of German business, is key to our activi-
ties. Additionally, we communicate with numerous companies in 
other sectors on the implementation of human rights due diligence 
duties, management approaches, risk scenarios and good practice 
examples; the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI) is 
particularly noteworthy. We are represented there as the first, and 
so far only, automotive manufacturer.
In Germany, we actively participate in the German automotive in-
dustry’s sector dialog in the context of the National Action Plan for 
Business and Human Rights, in which manufacturers, suppliers, 
trade unions, NGOs and the German federal government are in-
volved. Volkswagen AG, Audi and Porsche participate in the three 
working groups of the sector dialog.

RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Due to the complexity of its products, the Volkswagen Group’s sup-
ply chain is highly complex, globally distributed and subject to 
constant change. It comprises more than 65,000 supplier sites 
around the world in more than 100 countries.
In the Sustainable Procurement 2025+ strategy adopted during the 
reporting year, we set the following goals as an aspiration:
1. Performance: We improve our direct and indirect suppliers’ sus-
tainability performance through our activities.
2. Partnership: We work together with our suppliers and other 
stakeholders cooperatively, constructively and on an equal 
footing.
3. Transparency: We are committed to transparency in our activi-
ties and supply chains.
We will only be able to achieve these targets together with our sup-
pliers. That is why we pursue systematic and continuous develop-
ment of these suppliers founded on partnership-based coopera-
tion. This is also reflected in the key figures by which we want to be 
measured by 2025. For example, 85% of direct suppliers (based on 
revenue) will have their awareness of sustainability topics raised 
and be trained on these. We also want to reach a point where 85% of 
suppliers audited (based on revenue) obtain a sustainability rating 
of A. In our own Group, we will train 100% of buyers around the 
world on sustainability topics.
MANAGEMENT APPROACH WITH THREE DIMENSIONS OF 
ACTION
We want to live up to our responsibility in our business relation-
ships on a global level and act proactively beyond fulfilling legal re-
quirements. In procurement, we follow a three-pronged approach. 
This step requires transparency about the supply relationships that 
go beyond the first tier (tier 1).
• Prevent: Sustainability requirements are enshrined in contracts 
and specifications, particularly the Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners. Suppliers’ awareness is raised and they are trained in a 
comprehensive program.
• Detect: The sustainability risks in the supply chain are systemati-
cally detected and prioritized. Sustainability is anchored in the 
material contract award decisions across the Group and a rating 
of potential suppliers’ sustainability performance (“S rating”) is 
used. The basis for this is self-assessment and risk-based on-site 
audits.
• React: Various measures are available to react to the risks and im-
pacts identified. These include a standardized process to review 
breaches by individual suppliers and action plans from on-site 
audits.
Implementation of this management approach is mandatory 
worldwide and is enshrined in corresponding policies for the 
Group’s brands and controlled companies. The Procurement Strate-
gy department conducts the operational management. In order to 
identify current developments and long-term challenges in the in-
dividual countries, we also encourage dialog between our brands 
and regions through the Sustainability Procurement Network, in 
which more than 50 experts from five continents work together.
CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLIERS (PREVENT)
The core element of our supplier management is the “Volkswagen 
requirements for sustainability in relations with business part-
ners” – the Code of Conduct for Business Partners. The Code of 
Conduct applies to all the Volkswagen Group’s suppliers. It embeds 
our expectations of our business partners’ conduct with respect to 
key environmental, social and compliance standards in our con-
tractual agreements. The requirements are based, among other 
things, on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the rele-
vant International Labour Organization conventions. The Code of 
Conduct is, however, not just based on international stan dards, but 
also objectives, rules and policies of the Volkswagen Group.
Before submitting a quotation, our suppliers must confirm that 
they acknowledge our sustainability requirements; this explicit ac-
knowledgment must be repeated after 12 months have elapsed if 
they wish to submit new quotations. We also call on our tier 1 sup-
pliers to pass our requirements set out in the Code of Conduct 
down along the supply chain.

In addition to the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, there are 
additional product-specific requirements for suppliers. These are 
set out in the specifications and stipulate the way in which certain 
products must be manufactured. The guidelines include, for exam-
ple, only manufacturing battery cells with green energy and coop-
erating on full supplier disclosure for the cobalt supply chain. 
These requirements are also binding for the supplies in question.
SYSTEMATIC DETECTION OF SUSTAINABILITY RISKS (DETECT)
Our aim is to know and effectively address the material sus tain-
abil ity risks in our supply chain. A sustainability rating (S rating) 
was introduced as a key measure in 2019, and implementation of 
this is to be completed by the end of 2021. The S rating is used to au-
dit the sustainability performance of relevant¹ suppliers and reveal 
opportunities for continuous improvement. It assesses the envi-
ronmental performance of suppliers and their social sustainability 
and integrity.
The S rating is directly relevant to awarding contracts: if a supplier 
does not meet our requirements for compliance with sustainability 
standards, it is fundamentally not eligible for the award of con-
tracts. There is thus a direct incentive for suppliers to improve their 
sustainability performance.
The check for the S rating takes place via a multistage process. In an 
initial step, the risk exposure is identified from a combination of 
country risk and the supplier’s corporate processes and policies. A 
specialist service provider is used for the identification of the coun-
try risk. The Group’s sustainability performance is analyzed by 
means of a standardized questionnaire for self-assessment. We de-
veloped the “SAQ” questionnaire in a joint project with other auto-
motive corporations involved in the DRIVE Sustainability Working 
Group organized by CSR Europe. It was revised in 2020, including 
by adding the topics of grievance mechanisms, use of renewable 
energies and risk raw materials. The information and documents in 
the SAQ are rechecked and validated by a service provider via a cen-
tral platform: if a supplier states that it has appropriate processes 
and policies, it must prove this with documents. Minimum re-
quirements were drafted for the questionnaire. Every supplier that 
the S rating applies to must meet the requirements enshrined in 
the questionnaire in the areas of corporate governance, the environ-
ment, social issues, human rights, compliance and supplier 
management.
A total of more than 13,000 active suppliers submitted a sustainabili-
ty questionnaire by the end of the reporting period. In the reporting 
period, 1,369 suppliers improved their sustainability performance 
through taking appropriate steps. Based on sales revenue, more 
than 65% of our production suppliers have documented that they 
have a certified environmental management system in accordance 
with ISO 14001 and/or EMAS. Our objective is for 100% of suppliers 
with a production location and more than 100 employees to have a 
certified environmental management system by 2025.
Following an initial analysis of the supplier data, in-depth audits 
are carried out on site, based on risk. 790 (2019: 1,331) on-site audits 
were carried out worldwide in 2020. On average, six breaches of our 
sustainability requirements were identified. Clear differences can 
be seen depending on the region. In the reporting period, an on-site 
check for logistics service providers that takes account of the de-
centralized nature of the service provision, for example through 
an increased proportion of interviews with employees, was addi-
tionally introduced and piloted.

PER REGION AND IDENTIFIED TOP RISKS PER REGION 
In order to avoid duplication when auditing and for broader cover-
age of the supply chain, we are currently working together with 
OEMs and suppliers in a working group of the German Association 
of the Automotive Industry (VDA) on a joint standard for on-site 
audits.
By directly connecting the sustainability performance to eligibility 
for the award of contracts, the Volkswagen Group wants to send a 
signal to its suppliers to work towards sustainable penetration of 
the supply chain together with the Volkswagen Group. The primary 
aim is not to exclude suppliers from the supply chain through the S 
rating but rather to equip those who cannot yet produce a satisfac-
tory performance to do so. This is the only way in which positive 
impacts on people and the environment can be achieved. With this 
¹ The relevance of a business partner for the S rating results from factors including the size of the company or the risk exposure derived from the type of service.

in mind, every supplier has the option of undergoing a reassess-
ment after taking improvement measures. By the end of the report-
ing year, there were 13,041 ratings for suppliers. The order volume 
with these suppliers represents 75.68% of total volume. Of these 
suppliers, 4,093 have an A rating, and 220 were rated C and are thus 
not currently eligible for the award of contracts.
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ON SITE (REACT)
A series of measures are available to react to risks identified in the 
supply chain and concrete breaches by suppliers, and thus to ac-
tively bring about improvements.
Our supply chain grievance mechanism is an important compo-
nent of sustainable supply chain management. We use it to investi-
gate any suspected breaches of our sustainability requirements 
that suddenly occur. In 2020, the case management process was 
again revised and systematized and developed into a comprehen-
sive grievance management system.
The channel is accessible via our website, an email address and an 
anonymized channel and is open to anyone potentially affected 
and stakeholders, e.g. employees of suppliers, civil society players 
or representatives of communities in the immediate vicinity of our 
production locations. The processing of cases is uniformly de-
scribed in a binding policy and is managed by the Group. Cases are 
processed together with the brands and regions of the Volkswagen 
Group. If violations are identified, measures are introduced imme-
diately. If there are particularly serious breaches, termination of 
the business relationship is also possible.
Employees and external parties can also report potential breaches 
of rules on the part of our suppliers to the Volkswagen Group’s 
employee representatives or the trade union associations and use 
the Volkswagen Group’s whistleblower system or the channel 
sustainability@vwgroupsupply.com. This applies to possible 
breaches on the part of our tier 1 suppliers as well as sub-suppliers 
in the supply chain. External ombudsmen are available as a further 
point of contact.
During the reporting period, in addition to 34 cases that were pro-
cessed by Procurement, measures were also agreed with suppliers 
by Group Internal Audit. This concerned suppliers where behavior 
contravening the rules or contracts was identified as a result of in-
formation provided or audits carried out. The collaboration was 
ended or suppliers were blocked for new awards of contracts in the 
case of a total of 17 suppliers due to the activities of Procurement 
and Internal Audit.
CASES FROM THE COMPLAINT MECHANISM WORLDWIDE 
SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES AND PARTNERS
Systematic training of our employees and suppliers is a central 
component of our strategy and essential for the improvement of 
sustainability in the supply chain. We currently use three different 
formats for this. Firstly, we regularly carry out classroom trainings 
around the world. However, because these were only able to take 
place to a very limited extent in 2020, secondly, we expanded our 
range of live online trainings. In addition, there is also e-learning 
that can be accessed and completed online at any time.
For all Procurement employees, the topic of sustainability is an es-
tablished part of the skills profile. In 2020, more than 2,000 Pro-
curement staff worldwide were given training in this area. Our 
training measures continue also to be geared to specific target 
groups. For example, buyers of components associated with higher 
sustainability risks were given an intensive training program in a 
separate format. Since 2017, we have trained our Procurement em-
ployees to deal with the special challenges found in battery supply 
chains. More detailed human rights training has been available 
since 2020. An e-learning option available to all employees in Pro-
curement was also introduced in the reporting year. It particularly 
focuses on the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability requirements 
and their verification with the S rating.
In order to facilitate continuous supplier development, we usually 
conduct issue-specific sustainability training courses and work-
shops with our suppliers at selected locations. In the reporting peri-
od, this was only possible to a very limited extent. We therefore de-
veloped an online training option in order to train suppliers on our 
requirements and their implementation in shorter sessions. The 
format has been offered in English, German and Spanish from June 
2020. More than 950 supplier employees made use of this opportu-
nity in the reporting period. The supplier trainings in India, Argen-
tina, France and Russia originally planned as part of the Drive Sus-
tainability initiative, could not be held and will instead be run in 
2021.

In addition to the trainings, we make an e-learning module on sus-
tainability available to current suppliers in the nine languages of 
defined risk countries. The e-learning module was completely re-
vised both technically and in terms of content in 2020. By the end 
of the reporting year, more than 11,992 suppliers – representing 
17.4% of the sales revenue of suppliers of our procurement vol-
ume – had completed the e-learning module.
THEMATIC FOCUS AREAS
For the way we responsibly organize supply chains, the thematic fo-
cus areas of compliance, decarbonization and human rights are an 
indispensable part of our sustainability activities across the entire 
value creation process in the Volkswagen Group.
We audit the integrity and compliance systems of selected suppli-
ers and service providers through our Business Partner Due Dili-
gence (BPDD). This review of existing and potentially new business 
partners is carried out as part of a risk-based, transparent, docu-
mented process that is implemented worldwide using an IT-based 
tool. Business partners who we have identified as having an in-
creased corruption risk due to their business and region are also 
subjected to a more in-depth corruption risk audit. All relevant 
business partners will then be continuously checked for any 
change in general conditions through a risk and news screening. So 
far, our database contains 1,136 Business Partner Due Diligence 
audits.
 
 Strategy and Management > Integrity and Compliance
To achieve our climate-protection targets, the procurement pro-
cesses within the Group’s organizational structures and processes 
are currently under continuous development. In order to encour-
age measures for reducing greenhouse gases among suppliers, we 
systematically identify the biggest sources of emissions along the 
supply chain in a component-related way by means of life cycle as-
sessments, and we extend the responsibility for the environmental 
impact of our vehicles to our suppliers along the whole value chain. 
For example, all new suppliers of high-voltage batteries are contrac-
tually obliged to use certified energy from renewable sources in 
their production.
 
  Decarbonization > Decarbonization of the Supply Chain and 
 Climate-friendly Battery Production
PARTICULAR DUTY OF DUE DILIGENCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN 
THE SUPPLY CHAIN
As part of our sustainable supplier management measures, we 
pay particular attention to protecting those groups of people who, 
along our supply chain, are at particularly high risk of human 
rights abuses. In order to comply with international frameworks 
and requirements, we launched a human rights due diligence man-
agement system in 2020, which we use to systematically analyze, 
prioritize and reduce our supply chain’s human rights risks.
Our raw material supply chains require particular attention here. A 
raw material due diligence management system has additionally 
been set up to effectively handle the, in some cases extensive, risks 
in these supply chains. This sets out in detail the prioritization and 
processing of the raw material supply chains that we classify as 
particularly high risk. Our current focus is on 16 raw materials. The 
way we organize the responsible sourcing of raw materials is driven 
by the requirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Re-
sponsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and 
High-Risk Areas. This contains guidelines for management ap-
proaches, for risk identification and prevention, for checking smelt-
ers and for communication and reporting instruments.
Our current focus of action is battery materials, particularly cobalt. 
In close collaboration with our battery cell suppliers, we are pursu-
ing the objective of creating supply chain transparency from min-
ing the raw materials to manufacturing the finished product. This 
is the only way in which we can ultimately effectively prevent neg-
ative impacts. We have been passing the requirement for full trans-
parency on to our direct battery suppliers in our contracts since 
2020. An additional component of our strategy in this context is 
also cooperating directly with the mine operators, because the hu-
man rights risks are highest at the start of the supply chain and 
they can consequently be countered the most effectively here. 
Therefore, the plan is to also audit the sustainability performance 
of the mines in our supply chains. No standard for this is currently 
available. Volkswagen has therefore joined the CERA project (CERA = 
CErtification of RAw Materials). The project is dedicated to develop-
ing such a standard and has been testing this standard on selected 
raw materials in cooperation with a mining company since 2020.
With regard to the conflict minerals tin, tantalum, tungsten and 
gold, we require our suppliers’ management systems to exclude the 
use of minerals from smelters not certified in accordance with in-
ternational standards. We check these by obtaining reports about 
all smelters in our upstream supply chain through the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative’s internationally recognized Conflict Mineral 
Reporting Template and evaluating the results. If we identify non-
certified smelters in our supply chain, we take steps to certify these 
smelters.
Further information is reported separately in an OECD 5-Steps 
report.

R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  I N  S U P P LY  C H A I N S  A N D  B U S I N E S S
Within the framework of the management system, we also work on 
our duty of human rights due diligence in other raw material sup-
ply chains. To this end, we closely cooperate with our direct suppli-
ers and in suspected cases of noncompliance require our suppliers 
to disclose the sources of materials that may have some connection 
with human rights violations, such as child or compulsory labor as 
well as any other forms of modern slavery or human trafficking. 
This also applies to labor conditions in the extraction of raw mate-
rials such as mica or natural rubber. Because these processes are 
very time consuming as a result of the complexity of supply chains 
with up to eight tiers, we always proceed on the basis of risk.
If we discover human rights violations through on-site visits, an ac-
tion plan to remedy the deficits is agreed with the supplier and 
must be carried out. If this is not effective, sanctions will take ef-
fect. Our complaints process is crucial for violations that are re-
ported to us by other means or discovered by us. We enter into dia-
log with the supplier on a case-by-case basis and work toward 
improvement here. If no improvement occurs in the case of serious 
violations, this may lead to exclusion from the supply chain.
DIGITAL INNOVATIONS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND 
SECURITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
In order to increase transparency in the supply chain and to pre-
vent risks in raw material procurement, the Volkswagen Group re-
lies on disclosure of supply chains by direct suppliers and second- 
party supply-chain mapping audits. In addition, the Volkswagen 
Group is currently piloting the use of blockchain technology in cer-
tain global and complex supply chains.
For example, in 2019 the Volkswagen Group joined the Responsible 
Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN) for the responsible sourcing 
of strategic minerals using blockchain technology. Through this 
collaboration, we gained initial insight into the hurdles and poten-
tials of the technology for digitally tracking cobalt, which is used in 
lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Furthermore, the Group 
is working on possible approaches for tracking tin with partner 
company Minespider. Other minerals that are used for vehicle pro-
duction can, where appropriate, also be better tracked using digital 
technologies.
Another approach that enables suppliers to be extensively audited 
using artificial intelligence has been pursued with one service pro-
vider since 2020. Here, constant real-time monitoring of freely 
available internet sources including social media provides us with 
indications of possible violations by suppliers.
INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
The work in the tiers of the supply chain further upstream and be-
yond contractual relations requires more far-reaching efforts from 
us. We will only achieve this through joint, industry-wide initiatives 
and partnership-based collaboration with suppliers. Therefore, our 
goal must be to work together with them on improving their sus-
tainability performance. This refers both to those initiatives that 
serve the purpose of communication and setting standards and to 
mergers that have the aim of joint implementation of projects. In 
the former, we seek close cooperation with international organiza-
tions. For example, as part of our supplier management, we use the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative’s standardized reporting templates. 
As a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Battery Alli-
ance, we want to accelerate measures toward a socially responsible, 
environmentally sustainable and innovative battery value chain.
Our involvement in the industry-led initiative DRIVE Sustainabili-
ty under the umbrella of CSR Europe is also key for our activities. 
The development of the common questionnaire standard for audit-
ing sustainability aspects of suppliers was a milestone in this re-
spect, as was the training approach for suppliers pursued jointly 
with other OEMs via training events in selected countries.
In Germany, we are involved in the German federal government’s 
National Action Plan industry dialog on business and human 
rights. In its working groups on raw materials and on the introduc-
tion of overarching complaint mechanisms, we are promoting, 
among other things, the piloting of a cross-company complaint 
mechanism. 
In order to effect concrete changes on site through communication 
and dialog formats, we have additionally been participating in two 
projects in the countries of origin of our most important battery 
raw materials, cobalt and lithium, since 2020. We first joined the 
cross-sectoral Cobalt for Development project, which Deutsche Ge-
sellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit runs in the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo. It aims to improve the living condi-
tions of local people and contribute to a professionalization of 
small-scale mining, which is the indispensable livelihood for the 
local population. An on-site project for another battery raw materi-
al was also commissioned at the end of the reporting year. Together 
with corporate partners and with the participation of the local pop-
ulation, work is to be carried out in Chile to create socially compati-
ble and environmentally friendly conditions for mining lithium.

WORKFORCE 
 TRANSFORMATION

WORKFORCE  TRANSFORMATION
The Volkswagen Group is undergoing radical change and its work-
force with it. The whole automotive world is facing an approximate-
ly ten-year transformation corridor, at the end of which the role of 
automotive manufacturers as employers and the qualifications 
needed in the industry will be radically different from at the start 
of the decade. In view of the economic importance of the automo-
tive industry, successful transformation of this industrial sector is 
of interest for the whole of society. Our aim at Volkswagen is a suc-
cessful and socially responsible transition of employees to the new 
era of sustainable mobility. We want to continue to employ as 
many employees as possible in attractive, promising professional 
fields, to pay them good salaries and to provide secure jobs. In the 
areas affected by the change, it is vital to retrain and make neces-
sary adjustments to employment in a socially acceptable way.
The “workforce transformation” thus becomes the central concept 
and fundamental management approach for our current and fu-
ture activities in HR. Its central importance extends beyond HR: 
the transformation of the workforce has been defined as one of 
four focus areas for the Volkswagen Group as a whole as part of its 
sustainability strategy. Our ambition is:
In the comprehensive transformation of the automotive industry, we 
secure the employability of our employees and the technological ex-
cellence of our Group.
We commenced the transformation of our workforce systematical-
ly at the start of 2020: with increased training budgets, with train-
ing for the whole workforce where conventional plants are trans-
formed into plants for electric vehicles, with systematic research 
on the employment policy consequences of e-mobility and digitali-
zation and with further expansion of strategic staff planning.
The workforce transformation also challenges the human resourc-
es function as a whole in many ways. The HR department must 
therefore review and strengthen its resources for moderating the 
change in employment. We have been radically restructuring 
Volkswagen AG’s HR with the “OneHR” program since 2018. Sepa-
rate Group control units for the areas of HR principles and manage-
ment, HR strategy and innovation, and diversity and the advance-
ment of women were formed under the member of the Board of 
Management for HR. In addition, a unified model was developed 
for HR organization in the plants.
“OneHR” facilitates HR support for employees from a technically 
well-equipped advice center staffed by experts. In order to support 
all business units in the transformation, managers will be support-
ed by HR business partners in the future. In 2020, in addition to im-
plementation, we primarily focused on informing managers and 
employees about this structure modernization using a wide range 
of analog and digital internal communication measures. 
The Audi, Porsche and MAN brands began implementation of new 
HR management models modeled on “OneHR” in the 2020 fiscal 
year.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe did not come as 
a surprise to the Volkswagen Group in March 2020, because we had 
been gaining experience of the threat posed by the virus through 
our joint ventures in China since January. Protecting our employ-
ees throughout the Group and protecting our business neverthe-
less required an enormous effort.
The HR department faced a double challenge in 2020: firstly, a long-
term strategy with all the necessary building blocks for the success-
ful introduction of the transformation of the workforce needed to 
be developed. Secondly, the department faced the task of quickly 
establishing and rolling out the management system for dealing 
with the coronavirus pandemic under extreme pressure.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY IN THE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The most important task of 2020 was dealing with the consequenc-
es of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, preventing chains of 
infection from occurring at our plants. The Volkswagen Group has 
been taking extensive organizational and structural measures to 
protect against COVID-19 since December 2019. Overall, we were able 
to keep the number of cases among our employees significantly 
lower than the national average at all sites during 2020.
The central crisis team, headed by the members of the Group Board 
of Management responsible for human resources and finance, was 
responsible for global management and implementation of the 
measures. In addition, international task forces were formed for 
particular challenges, for example for transporting several thou-
sand employees and their families back from high-risk areas by air.
As part of restarting its production, the Volkswagen Group took the 
measures needed for maximum protection of the health of its em-
ployees at its plants. More than 50 process and health experts from 
all brands developed Group-wide standards over a period of several 
weeks in order to protect employees from COVID-19 infection risks. 
Executive managers and the General Works Council laid down their 
rules and measures for protecting workers in a separate company 
agreement. The corresponding catalog of measures included 
around 100 topics.

The area of occupational safety and health, which provided adviso-
ry support in particular to risk groups through its company physi-
cians and occupational safety specialists, took on an important 
role, including via a telephone hotline and by email. In addition, it 
had responsibility for implementing the operational action plan 
and risk assessments for restarting production. The Volkswagen 
Group also created and used its own test capacity and the infra-
structure for this at the sites.
In order to also support its more than 40,000 suppliers and service 
providers and several hundred haulers around the world with re-
starting their production and logistics during the coronavirus cri-
sis, the Group additionally made its ideas available to them. They 
were given access to the protective measures planned via the 
Volkswagen B2B platform www.vwgroupsupply.com.
Volkswagen Group China produces protective masks for Volkswagen 
employees in the European plants in the component plant in Tian-
jin. In addition to this, various Group companies – in some cases to-
gether with partners – produced their own face shield components 
using 3D printing. At the same time, Lamborghini, SEAT, ŠKODA 
and Volkswagen Passenger Cars worked on additional medical 
supplies.
But the experience from and need for regulation as a result of the 
coronavirus pandemic are not restricted to health protection. The 
coronavirus pandemic has set in motion fundamental changes to 
the way we work and collaborate with each other. Like in other 
companies, at Volkswagen the crisis particularly worked as a cata-
lyst for the breakthrough of digitalization in knowledge work: vir-
tual communication and collaboration, new formats for passing on 
knowledge and training, e.g. through podcasts or online tutorials, 
were quickly established and expanded. The Volkswagen Group’s 
steering entities were also kept working throughout lockdown with 
digital tools.
In compliance with all legal requirements and in keeping with pro-
cess security, all steps necessary for an orderly shutdown of our 
plants were taken, even though these were in some cases staggered 
in different parts of the world and always took place with an eye to 
the state of the pandemic. In this context, the transition to mobile 
work formats and the use of HR instruments such as reduced work-
ing hours that were used out at our sites are particularly notewor-
thy. The fact that COVID-19 developed in China before the rest of 
the world led to the advantage of having once already gone through 
both lockdown and the restart of plants in full. As a result, we gained 
elementary knowledge that contributed to an orderly and system-
atic approach in other regions of the world as well.
SHAPING THE TRANSFORMATION: SUCCESS FACTORS FOR 
SUCCESSFUL TRANSFORMATION
However much the coronavirus crisis continues to occupy us dur-
ing 2021 and however much the world of the new normal may dif-
fer from the old reality, the major process of restructuring the auto-
motive industry will continue, driven primarily by e-mobility, 
decarbonization and digitalization. We thus continued to work on 
our future-oriented program of transforming the workforce in 
2020 despite all the exceptional conditions. An important founda-
tion for this is the major research project “EMDI@VW – Impact of 
Electric Mobility and Digitalization on the Quality and Quantity 
of Employment at Volkswagen,” which we conducted together 
with the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO in 
Germany in 2019 and 2020. The project was financed by the 
Volkswagen Sustainability Council under the patronage of Michael 
Sommer, the long-standing president of the German Trade Union 
Confederation.
The Fraunhofer IAO’s task was to examine the quantitative and 
qualitative changes in employment at Volkswagen in the course of 
the change in the automotive industry and review the appropriate-
ness of HR policy instruments for managing this change.
Our central question was, in particular, whether the Volkswagen 
Group may, as a result of the transformation, find itself in a situa-
tion in which employment must be reduced more quickly than we 
can do this in a socially acceptable way through early retirement 
programs.
The completion of the study gave us a clear picture of the areas in 
which we will be building up employment in the future, where we 
will have to reduce it in the next few years and which qualification- 
related changes must be expected. In this respect, the study serves 
us as a blueprint for the workforce transformation, on which we 
base our activities. We have deliberately chosen to publish the study 
publicly in order to make our approaches and analyses accessible to 
other companies in the transformation as well.
The restructuring of the Volkswagen Group will only be successful 
if we involve our employees, train them, prepare them for the 
forthcoming changes as well as possible, give them a clear perspec-
tive and allow them to participate.

We have thus defined five principles for the workforce transforma-
tion that are geared to our social and employment guidelines and 
our HR strategy:
• Transparency, responsibility and participation
• Fair and attractive employer
• Increase in diversity and inclusion
• Transformation-oriented training
• Expansion of preventive health and occupational safety
Tailored measures, which are described in more detail in the subse-
quent parts of this chapter, were taken in the reporting year to im-
plement the ambition and targets for the workforce transformation 
focus area.
TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION
The Volkswagen Group employs more than 662,000 people, of 
which 118,673 at Volkswagen AG. Around one sixth of our employ-
ees are women. We work in 36 countries in Europe and 37 countries 
in the Americas, Asia and Africa and operate 118 production loca-
tions around the world, of which six are Volkswagen AG production 
locations. In all theses places, we assume responsibility for the em-
ployees and their families, but also for social and economic devel-
opment around our sites. For every employee, we aim for an em-
ployment relationship that is characterized by fair and transparent 
pay, good development opportunities, participation and involve-
ment in the work process and a high level of job security.
We are guided in our actions by clear values, especially in the trans-
formation phase. The Volkswagen Group Essentials set out the 
common basic values for all brands and companies within the 
Group. Seven simple “We” statements describe what the Group 
stands for: “We take on responsibility for the environment and so-
ciety”, “We are honest and speak up when something is wrong”, 
“We break new ground”, “We live diversity”, “We are proud of the 
work we do”, “We not me”, “We keep our word”.
OPINION SURVEY MEASURES EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION
We attach great importance to actively involving our employees in 
processes and to ensuring that their opinions, assessments and 
criticism are heard. In our Opinion Survey, an employee survey in 
172 companies of the Group, we measure the status of our internal 
employer attractiveness with a targeted question. In addition, we 
are also interested in our employees’ views on the questions of 
where the Group stands on the topic of integrity and how they as-
sess working relationships in the Group. The results of the Opinion 
Survey thus serve to identify possible improvements and inform 
managers of where action needs to be taken in their organizational 
units. In defined follow-up processes, managers take suitable mea-
sures in dialog with their employees and are supported in doing 
this by the Opinion Survey Group team, which provides various 
tools for this – such as a method toolbox.
In addition, a new, compulsory top-down approach has been devel-
oped, which was used for the first time following the discussions of 
results in January to July 2020. For the regular managers' measures 
discussion, a discussion of the measures derived and their imple-
mentation status will take place with a top-down approach, begin-
ning with the respective division manager/board member and pro-
ceeding to the lowest management level. The aim is to ensure the 
implementation of the measures derived from the organizational 
units in a lasting manner.
The 2020 Opinion Survey was carried out at 172 companies in 38 
countries. 436,326 of the 540,051 employees in the companies sur-
veyed responded. This is equivalent to a response rate of 81%. In 
2020, the score on the employee satisfaction index – a principal in-
dicator based on the Opinion Survey that is obtained from the sum 
of all responses to the survey – was 82.2 out of 100 possible index 
points and thus slightly above the score in the previous year (2019: 
80.0 index points).
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATION
When establishing cooperative labor relations marked by social 
harmony, we are guided by universally valid human rights and the 
standards of the International Labour Organization. Volkswagen is 
committed to global compliance with freedom of association and 
recognizes the basic right of all employees to form trade unions 
and workers’ representations. Employees’ right to negative freedom 
of association is also respected. The recognition of the right of all 
employees to form trade unions and workers’ representations also 
includes the entire value chain and all international Group sites 
and represents a key component of the Social Charter. The scope of 
the Social Charter extends to Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen 
Group’s controlled companies. The principles of the Social Charter 
were also integrated as a component of the sustainability require-
ments in the supply chain and in the Volkswagen Code of Conduct 
for Business Partners. Due to different political and legal condi-
tions, implementation of the OECD and ILO standards at all global 
production sites is not possible to the same extent as in the Europe-
an Union. Freedom of association is realized in compliance with 
the laws applicable in the various countries and locations. A par-
ticular challenge therefore arises in states that have not signed the 
ILO Convention on Freedom of Association and Protection of the 
Right to Organize. In order to bridge the tension between the differ-
ent national conditions and the interest in the greatest possible 
achievement of the right to organize, the Volkswagen Group relies 
on a long tradition of also organizing company labor relations in 
countries in which the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association 
and Protection of the Right to Organize has not been recognized. 
Concrete examples include Volkswagen do Brasil Indústria de 
Veículos Automotores Ltda., Škoda Auto Volkswagen India Pvt Ltd. 
and Ducati Motor (Thailand) Co., Ltd. Cases of discrimination due to 
membership of a trade union can be reported in the Volkswagen 
Group’s whistleblower system. These cases have, to date, not been 
separately statistically recorded because a statistical record of dis-
crimination incidents does not differentiate between the causes of 
the discrimination.

The form of our working relationships is also managed through a 
number of charters and declarations that we have agreed with the 
Group European Works Council and Global Group Works Council. 
These give our employees security with regard to their collective 
rights at the workplace and set out the principles of the Volkswagen 
Group’s labor policy. Together with the codetermination commit-
tees or the employee representatives, we implement these agree-
ments at the respective sites. They include:
• the Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen (Social Charter), which is geared to the relevant ILO 
conventions,
• the Charter on Labor Relations, which sets out additional infor-
mation,consultation and co-determination rights for employee 
representatives of the brands, companies and locations repre-
sented by the Group European Works Council and the Global 
Group Works Council,
• the Charter on Temporary Work, in which Group management as 
well as the Group European Works Council and the Global Group 
Works Council have agreed on principles relating to temporary 
work, for example guide values for the ratio of temporary to per-
manent employees, equal pay (for equal work), training mea sures 
and the limitation of employment periods with a subsequent re-
view as to whether to take on the employee permanently, and
• the Charter on Vocational Education and Training, in which pro-
fessional training is established as a central part of labor 
relations.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com/en/sustainability/policy
In addition, there are a number of locally applicable agreements 
with the relevant responsible trade unions that stipulate, for exam-
ple, standards for further training and for preventive healthcare 
measures. These fundamental standards and agreements underpin 
the rights of employees and their elected representatives at Group 
level in the Group European Works Council and the Global Group 
Works Council. Executive managers and employee representatives 
meet regularly to consult on relevant issues. All members of the 
Group European Works Council and the Global Group Works Coun-
cil attend at least one joint session of the two works councils every 
year. As well as discussing the current situation at the various sites, 
the respective HR managers and Group executive management also 
share information about product and workforce plans as well as 
social welfare and personnel standards.
We want to enable the most comprehensive representation of em-
ployee interests possible in our Group. We cooperate with the rele-
vant trade unions all over the world. Many companies in the 
Group also have a supervisory board on which the workforce is 
represented.
The Charter on Labor Relations allows employee representatives 
around the world to conclude agreements with local management 
on specific rights to information, consultation and co-determina-
tion. This far-reaching form of participation has proved highly suc-
cessful over many decades.
EMPLOYEE IDEAS WANTED
Through their creativity, their knowledge and their initiative, em-
ployees take on responsibility for improving processes and prod-
ucts and ultimately help us to achieve our sustainability goals. In 
2020, more than 14,850 ideas were submitted as part of idea man-
agement and savings of €43,554,277 were achieved at Volkswagen 
AG's sites.
Our own innovation fund also supports the development of busi-
ness ideas fit for the future. The common goal is to make a contri-
bution to job security or to expanding employment at Volkswagen 
sites through products and services along and outside of the auto-
motive value chain. Under an agreement between IG Metall and 
Volkswagen AG, the Group makes a fund of €20 million available 
for projects in new areas of business each year.
FAIR AND ATTRACTIVE EMPLOYER
We believe that an attractive employer is first and foremost a fair 
employer. That is why we adhere to the relevant national legal 
standards when dealing with all matters that affect our personnel. 
However, in line with our tradition of social partnership and the 
balancing of interests, we go beyond these standards: we want to 
allow all our employees throughout the world to share in 
Volkswagen’s social achievements and its high work and social 
standards.
Participation, initiative and individual creative opportunities are 
particularly important when it comes to keeping our promise to be 
an excellent employer. We would like our employees to be responsi-
ble, competent and confident “Company citizens” who actively take 
part in company affairs and get involved in decision-making 
processes.
In many of our companies, we have guaranteed the existence of 
jobs through collective bargaining agreements. In Volkswagen AG 
in Germany, we have extended job security until 2029 through the 
Digital Transformation Roadmap, which underlines our apprecia-
tion for industrial work. Through 2023, and possibly beyond, the 
Volkswagen brand in Germany wants to invest up to €4 billion in 
major digitalization projects and efficient administration within 
this framework.
73
W O R K F O R C E   T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
Agreements such as the Digital Transformation Roadmap provide 
the HR answers to various challenges at a national or international 
level. For example, Germany and other parts of Western Europe 
face not only risks resulting from demographic changes but contin-
ue to face shortages of skilled workers who we will need for cut-
ting-edge areas of work. In order to fill jobs with experienced and 
creative IT, digitalization and electrification experts even more to 
the benefit of the candidates, we are strengthening our efforts in 
digitalizing the internal recruitment processes. Applicants are at 
the heart of our activities, and we are increasingly addressing them 
via digital formats due to the current situation. This also includes 
our “Hello Possible 2.0” recruitment campaign for the Volkswagen 
brand, which we ran exclusively in digital space and which is aimed 
at selected experts from the areas of intuitive operability, digital 
transformation and emission-free mobility.
EXTERNAL EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS
One strategic indicator has been defined for the financial services 
business: external employer ranking. This involves taking part in 
external benchmarking, in general once every two years. The aim 
is to position ourselves as an attractive employer and derive appro-
priate measures to achieve a ranking among the top-20 employers 
by 2025, not just in Europe, but globally. Volkswagen Financial Ser-
vices AG was represented in various national and international 
best-employer rankings the last time it participated in 2019. Com-
ing in eleventh place, it was among the top European employers in 
the “Great Place to Work” employer competition. 
The ability to recruit top talent is of decisive importance, particu-
larly in view of the Company’s transformation into one of the 
world's leading providers of sustainable mobility solutions and the 
associated development of new business fields. We use the external 
employer attractiveness strategic indicator to check the position-
ing of the major passenger car-producing brands on the labor mar-
kets once a year with regard to graduates. Rankings in surveys con-
ducted by Universum, in which we aim to achieve top scores for the 
Group brands featured, serve as the basis for this. In fiscal year 
2020, the Porsche and ŠKODA brands fully achieved their targets 
and exceeded them in some cases. Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, SEAT and Audi were only able to 
partly achieve their targets or were unable to achieve them.
FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PAY
A fair and transparent pay system and payment of fair remunera-
tion make a significant contribution to employees’ work satisfac-
tion. In accordance with our Social Charter, the remuneration and 
fringe benefits for our employees correspond at least to the legally 
required minimum level which is to be guaranteed in the particu-
lar country. As they are collectively agreed with trade unions, our 
rates of pay are usually higher than the prevailing minimum levels. 
Our employees are generally selected, hired and promoted on the 
basis of their qualifications, experience and abilities. Individual 
pay is based on the job performed. In accordance with our values, 
matters of ethnic origin, skin color, gender, disability, ideology, 
faith, nationality, sexual orientation, social background or political 
beliefs – provided these are based on democratic principles and tol-
erance towards those who hold different views – play no part in 
classification.
Employees of Group companies enjoy further Company benefits. 
Depending on location, these may include subsidized transport 
and meals, employee terms at cooperation partners and discounts 
on certain leisure activities. Additional healthcare or supplemen-
tary pension benefits may round off the range of company bene-
fits at specific sites. By offering occupational pension schemes, 
Volkswagen AG and many of its brands and subsidiaries make an 
important contribution towards securing their employees’ income 
in old age.
CREATING A WORK/LIFE BALANCE
Volkswagen has recognized the need to be able to respond flexibly 
and at short notice in various life situations in order to give em-
ployees the opportunity to obtain leaves of absence. We are con-
stantly working on improving our employees’ work/life balance 
through flexible working time models. For example, we would like 
to take into account the specific needs of parents, single parents or 
employees who are also carers. The rules and programs here vary 
from country to country and are determined by the legal frame-
work and the results of collective negotiations.
In Germany, the large number of people who take advantage of 
their statutory parental leave entitlement proves how many em-
ployees wish for reconcilability of work and family life. In our Com-
pany regulations too, we endeavor to take into account the fact that 
many employees need greater flexibility as regards their working 
hours and place of work. Volkswagen AG, Audi, Porsche, SEAT and 
Bugatti have concluded far-reaching company agreements regard-
ing working outside company premises (mobile working).
In particular, we help our employees to care for and look after close 
relatives. Employees can take up to ten days’ leave at short notice in 
order to organize care for sick relatives, for instance. Employees can 
take up to six months’ leave or reduce their working hours for the 
same period in order to care for a relative. Employees can work 
part-time for up to 24 months in order to care for their families. For 
certain groups of employees – for example, at Volkswagen AG and 
Audi – there is an annual option: a conversion to paid leave may be 
made in place of payment of additional remuneration in ac cor-
dance with the collective agreement.
74
W O R K F O R C E   T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
We also consider childcare during working hours highly important 
for enabling work/life balance for our employees. The Volkswagen 
Group in Germany and abroad therefore endeavors to offer child-
care geared to specific groups of people. Additionally, we provide 
daycare centers near a number of our sites. Our reinstatement 
guarantee offers a high level of flexibility. For the past 20 years or 
so, Volkswagen AG employees have been able to take up to eight 
years’ leave of absence without having to give a reason. Regardless 
of whether this leave is for career development purposes or for pa-
rental leave, employees have a guaranteed right to re-employment 
on the same terms and conditions as before.
With these measures, we want to help not only meet the expecta-
tions of a modern working environment geared to human needs 
but also provide answers to many of the most urgent questions of 
the current transformation.
INCREASE IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
We want to boost our employees’ satisfaction and motivation and 
their willingness to constructively participate in change processes 
through equal opportunities, an attractive and modern working 
environment and a work organization fit for the future. The basis 
for this is an open, positive and partnership-based culture, a high 
level of diversity in the workforce and exemplary and inspiring 
leadership. Diversity, respect, tolerance and equal opportunities 
are decisive factors here. Talented people of any age and gender 
contribute to the future of our Group with their various skills and 
experiences.
We regard the diversity of our employees with their broad range of 
experience, viewpoints and problem-solving ideas as a pillar of our 
ability to shape the workforce transformation fairly. Through our 
diversity management and the implementation of the Diversity 
Wins @Volkswagen program, we wants to deliberately expand ap-
proaches for promoting diversity. The Group’s employees and diver-
sity management founded the “We Drive Proud” LGBTIQ*-&-friends 
network in 2019 with the support of Volkswagen AG’s Board of 
Management. The network not only represents the interests of les-
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender*, intersex* and queer people, it first 
and foremost aims to help to shape cultural change in the Group. 
“We Drive Proud” sees itself as an open, Group-wide initiative that 
maintains dialog with existing networks, e.g. those at Audi or Por-
sche. The Volkswagen Group intends to support the formation of 
employee networks even more strongly in the future and thus to 
promote personal initiative and the willingness to take on respon-
sibility. A similar network is currently being created at SEAT.
We have also codified the aim of diverse workforces in key docu-
ments. The declaration “We live diversity” as one of the seven 
Group Essentials is thus a firm part of the Volkswagen Group’s 
cultural DNA. The importance of equal opportunities and a high 
level of diversity in the workforce is also firmly anchored in the 
TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy. This is very important to us, be-
cause an open corporate culture increases employee motivation 
and performance and also customer satisfaction. This is because 
we are most likely to achieve customer satisfaction if all employees 
work creatively on innovative solutions with their different experi-
ence and perspectives.
The key to a diverse corporate culture is the systematic pursuit of a 
holistic diversity management approach: we not only want to es-
tablish processes geared to equal opportunities but also set and 
pursue targets for measurement of the effectiveness of our pro-
grams and measures. We have enshrined minimum standards for 
sustainably promoting diversity and equal opportunities in the 
HR Compliance Group policy we adopted in 2019. Since then, each 
company of the Group has been required to have at least one con-
tact for the topic of diversity and equal opportunities. In addition, 
we raise employee awareness and train employees on the impor-
tance of diversity and inclusiveness and use best practice examples 
and role models within the Group. This approach is intended to 
sustainably promote diversity and equal opportunities in our Group 
and helps us on the path of transformation.
DIVERSITY INDEX AS STRATEGIC KPI
Our diversity approach centers around quotas for women in man-
agerial positions and targets for the internationality of our top 
management. These two figures are combined in our diversity in-
dex, which has been in force since January 1, 2017. The diversity in-
dex forms part of our HR strategy and applies throughout the 
Volkswagen Group (in all companies with more than 1,000 employ-
ees) with its active workforce. With this index, we manage mea-
sures and assess the extent to which they have been implemented. 
At 15.3% in 2020, the proportion of women in management (com-
prising managers, senior managers and top managers [including 
the members of the Group Board of Management]) was slightly 
higher than the previous year’s level. We want to increase the pro-
portion of women in management to 20.2% by 2025. We aim to in-
crease the level of internationalization in top management, the up-
permost of our three management tiers, to 25.0% by 2025. In the 
past fiscal year this was 18.7% (2019: 18.4%). The figures for the pro-
portion of women and internationalization are included with equal 
weighting in an index that was set to 100 in each case for 2016. Both 
indices were equally weighted when setting targets and were in-
cluded in the compilation of the overall index (proportion of wom-
en figure and internationalization of top management figure). An 
increase in this index to 119 was planned for 2020. This target was 
narrowly missed with a figure of 118. These targets are decided by 
the Group Board of Management and apply to the whole organiza-
tion (in companies with more than 1,000 employees).

PURSUING GOALS FOR INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF 
WOMEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GERMAN LAW
We have also formulated goals as regards the proportion of women 
in management for Volkswagen AG in accordance with German 
law. In line with Germany’s law on equal participation for women 
and men in executive positions, Volkswagen AG has set itself tar-
gets for the proportion of women in management for the period to 
the end of 2021 of 13% on the first level of management (top man-
agers and senior managers excluding the Group Board of Manage-
ment) and 16.9% on the second level (non-senior managers) within 
the active workforce. As of December 31, 2020, the proportion of 
women in the active workforce at the first level of management was 
10.9% and at the second level of management it was 16.7%. The 
Group’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board are regularly 
updated on the progress we are making towards these targets.
In the reporting year, the proportion of women in managerial roles, 
measured in terms of the total workforce, was already 11.4% in 
senior management and 16.5% in non-senior management in 
Volkswagen AG. The proportion of women in top management in-
creased to 6.5% in the reporting year. The proportion of women in 
management generally in Volkswagen AG thus came to 13.9%, 
compared to 13.8% the year before.

EXCLUDING DISCRIMINATION AND BIAS
At Volkswagen, we have a clear stance when it comes to discrimina-
tion: we reject it, because we stand for respect, for equal opportuni-
ties, for working together and for equal treatment of people, irre-
spective of their ethnic origin, skin color, gender, disability, 
ideology, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, social background 
or political beliefs, provided the latter are based on democratic 
principles and tolerance towards those who hold different views. 
The Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct provides guidance 
throughout the Group and we sanction any breaches against the 
rules set out in it. Under the code, every employee and manager is 
responsible for ensuring that colleagues work together in partner-
ship and for taking action if rules are breached. We also keep cen-
tral statistics on this: in 2020, seven employees of the Volkswagen 
Group were dismissed due to breaches in the field of discrimina-
tion/harassment/stalking.¹
In many of the Volkswagen Group’s national companies around the 
world, initiatives are being implemented to drive improvements in 
diversity and inclusion to the benefit of women’s interests. For ex-
ample, Volkswagen launched an action plan in Argentina that is 
aimed at strengthening gender equality in working life in order to 
implement the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles. The focus is 
on a better work/life balance as a result of flexible working time 
models, the promotion of female managers and combating dis-
crimination and violence. Comparable programs with different fo-
cuses were also implemented at Volkswagen in Australia and Spain.
SUPPORTING INCLUSION AT THE WORKPLACE
Our understanding of diversity extends beyond gender equality, 
sexual orientation and internationality. We also pay attention to 
the integration of employees with disabilities. On an international 
level, we operate five protected workshops and are setting up addi-
tional workstations for more than 300 people with disabilities at 
the ŠKODA production sites in the Czech Republic.
Our responsibility for keeping employees in valuable activities for 
their entire career if possible also extends to the needs of employ-
ees with a restricted working capacity. After all, individual forms 
of work organization can result in significantly higher perfor-
mance and job satisfaction levels for these groups of employees. 
The Work2Work program provides a good example. Since 2001, 
Volkswagen AG has opened up new career opportunities within the 
business for employees with differing abilities. In Wolfsburg, near-
ly 700 employees are currently employed in Work2Work jobs in 
around 130 different areas.
TRANSFORMATION-ORIENTED TRAINING
As an employer, we want our employees to be able to work creating 
value at workplaces in our Group for their entire working lives. This 
requires not just for them to retain their health, but also adjusting 
skills and capabilities to the quickly changing environment. That is 
why training our employees and adjustment to new work and ca-
reer profiles is a key action area in the workforce transformation. 
This is because the comprehensive specialist qualifications of our 
employees remain the basis for the highest technological excel-
lence. The electrification of the vehicle fleet, the transition towards 
connected, autonomous driving and the digital transformation of 
our Group mean that employees already need very different quali-
fications today. We handle these changes with our differentiated 
vocational and advanced training system with its tailored training 
measures.
DUAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING LAYS THE FOUNDATION
Dual vocational training at the Volkswagen Group supports the 
workforce transformation. With its flexible combination of practi-
cal activities and theoretical knowledge, vocational training pre-
pares our young professionals for the forthcoming challenges. On 
an international level, we implement the high German training 
standards but also comply with the relevant national standards 
and regulations.

In 2020, the Volkswagen Group trained 17,939 young people. We also 
support the career development of new entrants once they have 
completed their apprenticeship. For example, particularly talented 
young specialists are nurtured in talent groups.

Governance Declaration
TRAINING SKILLED WORKERS AND MANAGERS
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, which is responsible for voca-
tional and advanced training, skilled workers can choose from a 
broad range of advanced training courses. These range from fur-
ther training on topics of the future and occupational or cross-dis-
ciplinary areas of general interest to specific qualifications in voca-
tional groups and even comprehensive personnel development 
programs. The range of learning opportunities is being expanded 
continuously. The global COVID-19 pandemic meant that only a re-
stricted range of options was available in 2020, particularly in 
multidisciplinary areas. A greater shift from classroom seminars to 
online seminars is taking place. The establishment of a new learn-
ing ecosystem is also planned for 2021. The range of learning op-
portunities is being expanded continuously.
We ran the Senior Management Program as a remote learning pro-
gram in 2020 following successful pilots in 2019. To this end, we are 
cooperating with the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) in Potsdam and 
the École des hautes études commerciales de Paris (HEC). A new 
management program for newly appointed managers was 
launched in collaboration with the company Malik St. Gallen.
The majority of our development programs and selection proce-
dures for managers are standardized throughout the Group.
In view of the transformational challenges, the Volkswagen Group 
puts a special emphasis on employees’ ability to act agilely and en-
trepreneurially. Until recently, there has, however, been a lack of 
uniform standards that define concrete agile skills. We therefore 
developed a skills matrix for training in the area of agile business 
processes together with 30 major listed companies from Germany, 
Austria and Switzerland in the DACH30 initiative. In the course of 
this, the Volkswagen Group Academy established a comprehensive 
training portfolio on agility. 38 trainings were held in 2020. Togeth-
er with the Agile Center of Excellence, which was founded in 2015, 
and other internal experts on agility, the Agile Challenge was pub-
lished in 2020 as a digital self-learning program in order to make 
knowledge and experience on agile working available to more than 
1,000 interested parties in the Group.
INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT OF SKILLS FOR NEW 
TECHNOLOGIES
In the current upheaval of the automotive industry, the 
Volkswagen Group’s particular focus in education is on training 
employees on important future technologies and closely support-
ing them in the transformation process. For example, the Group 
implemented a comprehensive qualification program for around 
8,000 employees for a ramp-up of the new electric models at the pi-
lot site for e-mobility in Zwickau. In addition, more than 2,000 em-
ployees have passed through the e-mobility training center and 
completed its full-day training courses.
By 2023, Volkswagen AG wants to create at least 2,000 new jobs con-
nected to digitalization at its traditional West German sites. For the 
HR transformation in the course of the digitalization drive, the 
Group is increasing its training budget relating to new technologies 
by €60 million to a total of around €160 million. In addition, an on-
line university will be set up, learning will be strengthened via on-
line platforms and vocational and advanced training will be adapt-
ed to new requirements. This includes, for example, the Faculty 73 
program with which we broaden the knowledge basis for the digital 
transformation in the Group. We train 100 software developers 
each year here for our own needs. The AutoUni’s two-year training 
program is designed for employees and in-house and external can-
didates with an affinity for IT.
In this way, we open up career advancement opportunities to un-
discovered talents. The future experts acquire all the necessary 
skills for a successful career as a software developer in the automo-
tive industry within the training. This includes, for example, pro-
gramming in Java, mathematics for software developers, technical 
and theoretical computer science, expertise in computer networks, 
databases and mobile app programming. Volkswagen plans to 
transfer the participants of the first academic year to the perma-
nent workforce at the start of 2021 following intensive training. In 
March 2020, 100 people became the second year of students to be-
gin the training program. This second year of students was even 
more diverse than the first generation of Faculty 73, with women 
totaling 9% of the students and participants coming from more 
than seven countries. The recruitment of two refugees who the 
Group’s refugee aid had previously supported with language cours-
es is particularly noteworthy.
The Volkswagen Group is also supporting the establishment of an 
innovative programming school in Wolfsburg. The 42Wolfsburg e.V. 
Association is setting up the “42Wolfsburg” IT school in cooper-
ation with the private and nonprofit École 42, whose head office is 
in France. The training institution is set to open in Wolfsburg’s 
Markthalle at the start of 2021. Up to 600 students will then be 
trained without a teacher or fixed lecture timetable using an inno-
vative training concept. The school particularly promotes prac-
tice-oriented learning in line with the peer learning principle, in 
which the students learn from and with each other. Like at École 42 
in Paris, the free training at 42Wolfsburg is also open to applicants 
who have not graduated high school or college, irrespective of their 
age, sex or origin.

EXPANSION OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH AND OCCUPATIONAL 
SAFETY
The coronavirus pandemic has shown how important employees 
and their health are. Against this background, we are further ex-
panding preventive healthcare and occupational safety in the 
Volkswagen Group because physical well-being is a prerequisite for 
being able to perform professionally and cope with mental and 
physical strain that are typical of work in a manufacturing compa-
ny undergoing transformation. In the area of health, sustainability 
means for us that we want to help every employee to retire healthy. 
This long-term approach also helps our Group to cope with demo-
graphic change in the form of an aging population, which is now 
typical of many industrial countries in which we operate.
Holistic health management at Volkswagen already goes beyond 
the statutory preventive healthcare and occupational health and 
safety requirements. It also includes aspects such as work organiza-
tion, ergonomics, prevention, integration and rehabilitation, along 
with leadership culture.
GROUP POLICY SETS OUT PRINCIPLES FOR OCCUPATIONAL 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Our employees receive medical care at all our sites in accordance 
with the relevant national legal regulations and internal rules and 
on the basis of Group guidelines on protecting and promoting 
health. All Group sites have at least one facility for dealing with 
medical emergencies. Most of them also offer medical care provid-
ed by a company doctor.
A Group policy regulates the responsibility for occupational health 
and safety uniformly for all the Group’s brands and companies. 
Healthcare is managed at Group level by the Head of Group Occu-
pational Health and Safety, who is also Volkswagen AG’s senior phy-
sician. The senior physician reports directly to the Chief Human 
Resources Officer. In organizational terms, the management of oc-
cupational safety at Group level is assigned to Group Occupational 
Health and Safety. The Head of Occupational Safety also reports di-
rectly to the Chief Human Resources Officer.
The Group Steering Committee for Healthcare makes decisions on 
strategic direction and coordinates topics of fundamental impor-
tance across brands. The steering committee initiates projects, en-
sures the transparency of expert knowledge and organizes the lev-
eraging of synergies in healthcare. Its participants are the Head of 
Group Healthcare and the brands’ heads of healthcare or their rep-
resentatives. The Group Steering Committee for Occupational Safe-
ty prepares and coordinates decisions on the strategic direction 
and development of occupational safety within the framework of 
the governance model of occupational safety. Its participants are 
the Head of Group Occupational Safety and the brands’ heads of oc-
cupational safety or their representatives.
PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
In addition to meeting statutory requirements, Volkswagen’s 
Health department focuses to a large extent on preventive ap-
proaches. Employees are therefore offered regular checkups. In fis-
cal year 2020, 553 initial and 1,445 subsequent checkups were car-
ried out by the Health Department. Since the introduction of the 
service in 2010, a total of 88,999 Volkswagen checkups have been 
completed (active permanent workforce). As part of the discussion 
of the checkup findings, employees are offered customized health-
care services. New scientific knowledge is piloted in this context 
and made available to employees as quickly as possible.
GREATER OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY THROUGH THE SAFETY FIRST 
STRATEGY
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the 
continuous improvement of occupational health and safety is vi-
tally important to us. In 2004, the Volkswagen Group adopted an 
internationally valid occupational safety policy. Among other 
things, it is intended to ensure the development of concepts in 
Group companies for continually improving occupational safety at 
work. This policy is currently being revised.
In the area of occupational safety, sustainability means for us that 
employees do not suffer accidents when working. Volkswagen is 
supporting this objective through the introduction of the Safety 
First strategy. The vision of this strategy is to anchor occupational 
safety as a guiding principle in the actions of all managers and em-
ployees. All occupational safety processes are to be known and to 
be applied reliably. Workplaces are to be safe and the Occupational 
Safety department is to be involved in shaping them. All managers 
and employees are to be informed and trained and act in line with 
safety requirements.
The strategy requires all Volkswagen Group production sites to 
comply with the ISO 45001 standards and more specific Group re-
quirements. The corresponding management systems will be in-
troduced autonomously at the Group brands by the end of 2021. At 
the end of 2020, a total of 46 Group sites were certified in accord-
ance with ISO 45001.
In addition to the number of certified management systems, the 
Volkswagen Group uses the accident frequency and accident severi-
ty for employees excluding temporary agency workers as a key per-
formance indicator for reporting. The accident frequency index 
provides information on the number of accidents at work as a pro-
portion of the total of all hours worked. It is calculated as the num-
ber of accidents at work reported x 1 million divided by total num-
ber of hours worked. The accident severity index shows the severity 
of the accidents reported by showing the total number of working 
days lost due to accidents reported in the fiscal year as a proportion 
of the total of all hours worked. It is calculated as the number of 
78
W O R K F O R C E   T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
working days lost through accidents reported in the fiscal year x 
100,000 divided by the number of hours worked. The Group uses a 
Group process standard to provide cross-brand information in the 
event of serious or fatal accidents involving our own employees or 
workers from partner firms. On this basis, specific measures can be 
taken to prevent similar accidents across all our sites in the future. 
In 2020, the accident frequency was 3.5 (2019: 3.8) in the 
Volkswagen Group and 5.5 (2019: 5.4) in Volkswagen AG. Accident 
severity was 5.1 (2019: 5.5) in the Volkswagen Group and 7.4 (2019: 
6.4) in Volkswagen AG. The Volkswagen Group and Volkswagen AG 
did not record any fatal accidents involving our own employees in 
the reporting year.
RETAINING THE ABILITY TO PERFORM AND HEALTH
Our employees’ physical performance and mental well-being are 
crucial for successfully and responsibly overcoming the challenges 
of the workforce transformation. We created the prerequisites here 
with the holistic health management system established across the 
Group and with the Safety First strategy. In close cooperation with 
executive managers and the Works Council, it has been possible to 
closely limit the health effects of COVID-19 and achieve maximum 
protection for employees, suppliers and service providers.
MANAGING THE WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION AND MAKING 
IT MEASURABLE
With our five principles of action, we have established a holistic 
concept in order to support our workforce through the automotive 
industry’s approximately ten-year transformation corridor as well 
as possible and also make decisive contributions to the Volkswagen 
Group’s competitiveness. It is important to us that the workforce 
transformation is a stakeholder-oriented approach that also incor-
porates the local companies at our locations and the future viabili-
ty of economies in which we operate and are frequently also the 
largest private employer.
We want to follow this path resolutely and to be measured by con-
crete progress with regard to reaching our targets. To this end, we 
use strategic key performance indicators that are partly anchored 
in the Group HR strategy and partly in a specific KPI: for internal 
employer attractiveness we conduct annual employee surveys and 
measure satisfaction using our Opinion Survey (2020: 88.2 in the 
Volkswagen Group; 86.9 in Volkswagen AG). The diversity index 
(2020: 118) is the key performance indicator for us regarding in-
creasing the proportion of women in management and the level of 
internationalization in top management.

ABOUT THE NONFINANCIAL REPORT (NFR)
The following index provides an overview of the disclosures re-
quired for the nonfinancial report in accordance with HGB section 
315c in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e, together with 
appropriate references to the sections of this Group Sustainability 
Report in which these disclosures may be found.
EY has conducted a voluntary limited assurance engagement in ac-
cordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the elements of the Group 
Sustainability Report that make up the nonfinancial report.
All text passages, tables and graphics in the Group Sustainability 
Report that form part of the nonfinancial report are highlighted. 
References to disclosures outside the nonfinancial report are sup-
plementary information and do not form part of the nonfinancial 
report.
In the course of evaluating the statutory reporting requirements, 
Volkswagen expanded its materiality analysis in 2017 and revised 
the action areas in terms of the requirements of the CSR Directive 
Implementation Act (CSR-RUG): in line with CSR-RUG, this non-
financial report will concentrate on focus areas and enablers that 
are necessary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group’s 
business development, overall performance and position as well as 
the Volkswagen Group’s impact on nonfinancial aspects.
The revision of the materiality analysis started the previous year 
was continued and the creation of a new sustainability narrative 
concluded in the 2020 reporting year. The sustainability narrative 
defines four focus areas and five enablers for the Volkswagen 
Group that establish a new strategic basis. Some 60 stakeholders 
were involved in this process, including decision-makers and dis-
seminators from various divisions and brands as well as rep re sen-
ta tives of the Sustainability Council. The starting point for our ma-
teriality analysis has always been the Sustainable Development 
Goals formulated by the United Nations, which describe the social 
challenges facing companies.

* This action area relates to both environmental and social matters.
Reportable connections have been identified in this nonfinancial 
report to amounts reported in the 2020 annual or consolidated fi-
nancial statements. In fiscal year 2020, negative special items in 
connection with the diesel issue amounting to €–0.9 (–2.3) billion 
affected operating profit in the Passenger Cars business area. These 
items resulted mainly from legal risks. 
In response to the currently known legal risks related to the diesel 
issue, the provisions for litigation and legal risks as of December 31, 
2020 included an amount of around €1.9 (2.9) billion based on ex-
isting information and current assessments. Insofar as these can be 
adequately measured at this stage, contingent liabilities relating to 
the diesel issue were disclosed in the notes to the consolidated fi-
nancial statements in an aggregate amount of €4.2 (3.7) billion, 
whereby €3.5 (3.4) billion of this amount results from lawsuits filed 
by investors in Germany. 
Depending on the jurisdiction concerned, the miscellaneous provi-
sions include risk provisions for any noncompliance with legal 
emissions limits. Their measurement takes into account, among 
other things, the respective sales volume and the legally defined 
tax or the cost of acquiring emission rights from other manufac-
turers. Advantage has been taken of synergies between individual 
brands of the Volkswagen Group by establishing emission pools 
where possible. Additional information on this matter can be 
found in the Annual Report in the notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements.

TABLES AND KPIS
The following tables of key performance indicators give an overview 
of further selected Volkswagen Group KPIs. The tables are themati-
cally assigned to the chapters. The figures in the tables for December 
of the preceding year may include an estimate if, for example, they 
are based on bills from power suppliers that were not yet available 
at the time of compilation. In the next data collection round, these 
estimates will be replaced with the finalized figures for December.
The following should be noted regarding the environmental key 
performance indicators: the scope of the report for the Scope 1 
GHG emissions was expanded in 2020 in order to achieve harmoni-
zation with the Group objective of production in line with the Sci-
ence Based Targets initiative. The CO2 equivalents are no longer re-
ported separately but included in the Scope 1 GHG emissions in the 
reporting years shown. In addition, the scope of the report for ener-
gy consumption was expanded to include energy consumption in 
the reporting years shown. In addition to the production sites’ en-
ergy consumption, energy supplies to third parties are also pre-
sented in the reporting years shown.

projects in the supply chain (closed-
loop management of aluminum scrap 
and renewable energy for battery cell 
production) led to a 0.04 t CO₂/vehicle 
reduction of total emissions in the 
DCI. The new basis was also taken into 
account in 2019.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT
The assurance engagement performed by Ernst & Young (EY) re-
lates exclusively to the German version of the combined non-finan-
cial report 2020 of Volkswagen AG. The following text is a transla-
tion of the original German Independent Assurance Report.
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the sepa-
rate non-financial report of Volkswagen AG according to § 289b 
HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code), which is 
combined with the separate non-financial report of the group ac-
cording to § 315b HGB, consisting of the disclosures in the Sustain-
ability Report 2020 highlighted in color for the reporting period 
from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 (hereafter combined 
non-financial report). Our engagement exclusively relates to the in-
formation highlighted in color as detailed above in the German 
PDF version of the Sustainability Report. Our engagement did not 
include any disclosures for prior years.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the combined non-financial report in accordance 
with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB. 
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appro-
priate methods to prepare the combined non-financial report as 
well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual 
disclosures, which are reasonable in the circumstances. Further-
more, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal 
controls that they have considered necessary to enable the prepara-
tion of a combined non-financial report that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITOR’S DECLARATION RELATING TO INDEPENDENCE AND 
QUALITY CONTROL 
We are independent from the Company in accordance with the pro-
visions under German commercial law and professional require-
ments, and we have fulfilled our other professional responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. 
Our audit firm applies the national statutory regulations and pro-
fessional pronouncements for quality control, in particular the by-
laws regulating the rights and duties of Wirtschaftsprüfer and 
vereidigte Buchprüfer in the exercise of their profession [Berufs-
satzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer] as well 
as the IDW Standard on Quality Control 1: Requirements for Quali-
ty Control in audit firms [IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: An-
forderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüfer-
praxis (IDW QS 1)].
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on 
the combined non-financial report based on the assurance engage-
ment we have performed.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Re-
vised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Audit-
ing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This Standard requires 
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain lim-
ited assurance about whether the combined non-financial report of 
the Company has been prepared, in all material respects, in accord-
ance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB. In a limited 
assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in extent 
than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a sub-
stantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The assurance proce-
dures selected depend on the auditor’s professional judgment. 
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, which has been 
conducted between September 2020 and February 2021, we per-
formed amongst others the following assurance and other 
procedures:
• Inquiries of relevant managerial employees of the group regard-
ing the conduction of the materiality analysis as well as the se-
lection of topics for the combined non-financial report, the risk 
assessment and the concepts of Volkswagen for the topics that 
have been identified as material, 
• Inquiries of relevant managerial employees responsible for data 
capture and consolidation as well as the preparation of the com-
bined non-financial report, to evaluate the reporting processes, 
the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal 
controls to the extent relevant for the assurance of the combined 
non-financial report,
• Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the 
combined non-financial report,
• Inspection of relevant documentation of the systems and pro-
cesses for compiling, aggregating and validating data in the rele-
vant areas in the reporting period, 
• Analytical evaluation of disclosures in the combined non-finan-
cial report at parent company and group level,
• Inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis relating 
to the collection and reporting of selected data,
• Evaluation of the implementation of group management re-
quirements, processes and specifications regarding data collec-
tion through onsite visits at selected sites of the Volkswagen 
Group

ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
Based on our assurance procedures performed and assurance evi-
dence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the combined non-financial report of Volkswagen 
AG for the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 has not 
been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c 
in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
INTENDED USE OF THE ASSURANCE REPORT
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with 
Volkswagen AG. The assurance engagement has been performed 
for the purposes of the Company and the report is solely intended 
to inform the Company as to the results of the assurance engage-
ment and must not be used for purposes other than those intend-
ed. The report is not intended to provide third parties with support 
in making (financial) decisions.

parties. We assume no responsibility, liability or other obligations 
towards third parties unless we have concluded a written agree-
ment to the contrary with the respective third party or liability 
cannot effectively be precluded. 
We make express reference to the fact that we do not update the as-
surance report to reflect events or circumstances arising after it 
was issued unless required to do so by law. It is the sole responsibil-
ity of anyone taking note of the result of our assurance engage-
ment summarized in this assurance report to decide whether and 
in what way this result is useful or suitable for their purposes and 
to supplement, verify or update it by means of their own review

NEW AUTO: VOLKSWAGEN REINVENTS ITSELF
The world of mobility will change fundamentally by 2030:  
electric drives and fully networked, self-driving transportation will 
determine how we move around in the future.  
With the new Group strategy, “NEW AUTO – Mobility for Generations to 
Come”, the Volkswagen Group wants to be a significant driver of this 
transformation and accelerates its realignment from a vehicle manu-
facturer to a world-leading, software-driven mobility provider. A company 
that is redefining mobility while also doing business climate neutrally 
and conscientiously.

INTERVIEW
1.  How is sustainability reflected in the new strategy, NEW AUTO?
Dr. Herbert Diess: The NEW AUTO world will be free of emissions, smarter and above all more sus-
tainable. The key to making that happen is getting more electric cars on the road. This is what we 
achieved in 2021: we are the e-mobility market leader in Europe and the number two in the USA. We 
are expanding the charging infrastructure in Europe, China and the USA to 45,000 charging points 
by 2025. We are planning to build six battery factories by 2030 together with partners and deal with 
entire battery cycles. And electric drives bring economic advantages in the truck segment as well.
Only sustainable products will stand the test of time. E-mobility is increasingly paying off for cus-
tomers. Calculated per kilometer, our electric vehicles are already cheaper to run than vehicles with 
internal combustion engines. We are driven by our commitment to the Paris climate goals and we at 
Volkswagen want to be carbon neutral by 2050. Furthermore, we have embedded the issues of ESG, 
decarbonization and integrity as points of strategic focus in NEW AUTO. 
What is important for decarbonization is a shared consensus between politicians, industry, customers 
and society. A key milestone in 2021 was our readmission to the UN Global Compact, the world’s  
largest sustainable corporate management initiative. We regard this as a sign that we are building 
stakeholders’ trust in our strategy.

2.  What progress has the Volkswagen Group made in 2021? Is sustainability becoming a business 
model? 
Georg Kell: The NEW AUTO strategy signals Volkswagen’s determination to advance electric mo-
bility and establish new areas of business along the value chain. The associated investments and 
business decisions are obviously the most important development. By doing this, Volkswagen is 
positioning itself at the forefront of the transition from the fossil-driven approaches of the pollut-
ing industrial age to smart and clean processes. Implementing the strategy is causing an upturn  
in green electricity, efficiency and circular material flows and thus significantly contributes to  
reducing greenhouse gases.
We also made progress on the management of ESG data and on decarbonization approaches.  
Measures to promote compliance and integrity, particularly in supply chain management, are now 
firmly established across the Group. Herbert Diess has very clearly spoken out in favor of the energy 
transformation and higher carbon prices, and a new industrial collaboration has also been started. 
Volkswagen has become more innovative and more modern.
Sustainability is already a prerequisite for long-term business success. It’s long been known how 
much mistakes cost companies. Volkswagen’s recent diesel crisis is just one example of this. Legal 
changes, the shift in customer preferences and investor awareness of risks and opportunities in 
connection with sustainability topics mean sustainability will now also become a value driver. 
Companies will only be successful in the long term if they integrate these trends into their strategy 
and activities. The key word here is “integration” – i.e. that sustainability becomes completely matter 
of course in all roles and in the minds of all the Group’s managers and employees. It is just as im-
portant to propagate and embed the concept of decarbonization and circular material flows within 
our business and at suppliers, so what matters is accelerating the transformation.
 
3. Where does the Volkswagen Group need to show even more engagement? Where are the  
sustainability challenges for a group that operates in 153 countries? 
 
Daniela Cavallo: We support the Group’s strategy of concentrating on electric drives and see our job 
as ensuring that profitability and job security are given equal consideration.
In addition to the technical shift to e-mobility, the area of socio-environmental change will also be 
one of the most pivotal points of the transformation. Here we need to help shape this change at an 
early stage. Rapid implementation of the transformation can only succeed if we reach the whole 
Group and every employee and get them on board. It’s important to us as a works council that a top-
ic such as employer attractiveness and the associated employee satisfaction are factored in. That’s in 
line with our Volkswagen culture.
GRI 102-16

I N T E R V I E W
By implementing new business areas and as a result of employee training, we’re on the right track 
to develop issues such as sustainability, transformation and employee satisfaction into a success.
The challenge for us is to create standards that conform to the goals of the Paris Agreement. We’re 
confident that we can derive rules on the basis of these standards that our international partners 
will adopt. However, this also includes convincing people at sites that have to deliver sustainability 
promises under different political conditions. 
Our society is becoming more and more conscious of sustainable action. Just like with a technological 
edge, the field of sustainability naturally still has a lot of potential, and Volkswagen can also be a pi-
oneer here. The business model therefore not only needs to be measured by its monetary success 
but must also pursue social and environmental issues. The trend among rating agencies to prioritize 
the social area in addition to the environmental and governance areas is in line with the Works 
Council’s principles.

BASIS FOR REPORT
For reporting year 2021, Volkswagen AG is issuing a nonfinancial 
statement at Company level and a nonfinancial Group declaration, 
which are being published together as a combined separate 
nonfinancial report within the meaning of HGB sections 289b 
para. 3 and 315b para. 3. The nonfinancial report is drawn up in 
accordance with HGB section 315c, in conjunction with sections 
289c through 289e. Furthermore, the GRI Standards of the Glob-
al Reporting Initiative (GRI) are used as the framework for draw-
ing up the nonfinancial report. In this nonfinancial report, 
Volkswagen systematically uses the GRI Standards as the under-
lying structure for reporting on management approaches and 
the specific standard disclosures. In line with the German CSR 
Directive Implementation Act (CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungs-
gesetz – CSR-RUG), this nonfinancial report concentrates on the 
focus issues necessary for an understanding of the Volkswagen 
Group’s business development, overall performance and position 
as well as the Volkswagen Group’s impact on nonfinancial as-
pects. We are reporting in detail on our climate protection activi-
ties in line with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclo-
sures (TCFD) requirements for the first time.
The Group Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance 
with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
applying the “Core” option. 
The strategy chapter and the six following chapters on focus  
issues in the report each consist of a text section plus a 
consol i dated KPI table at the end of each chapter. At the same 
time, the separate GRI Content Index shows how we are imple-
menting the requirements of the United Nations Global Com-
pact (UNGC). The GRI Content Index has been separated from the 
2021 Sustainability Report and can be found as a separate docu-
ment in the Group portal:

References to disclosures outside the nonfinancial report are sup-
plementary information and do not form part of this report. The 
following passages are also not part of the nonfinancial report:
• Interview (p. 4–6) 
• Value Chain (p. 12) 
• The German Corporate Governance Code and  
  Further Information (p. 13) 
• Making the Social and Environmental Impact  
  of Our Actions Measurable (p. 19)
The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group 
as a whole. Where information relates to individual Group divi-
sions only, this is clearly indicated in the text. Unless indicated 
otherwise, any information provided for the Group also applies 
to Volkswagen AG. In addition to Volkswagen AG, the Group  
includes all major subsidiaries inside and outside Germany that 
are directly or indirectly controlled by Volkswagen AG. The KPIs 
and the associated targets include the Bugatti brand companies

A B O U T  T H I S  R E P O R T
on the topics of the UEP (the reduction of the environmental im-
pact of production), the DCI (the decarbonization index), the 
Opinion Survey and the diversity index on a pro rata basis up to 
and including October 2021. 
Bugatti is not included in the accident figures.
Navistar International Corporation (Navistar), which was ac-
quired on July 1, 2021, is not included in the key figures or asso-
ciated targets on the topics of the UEP (the reduction of the envi-
ronmental impact of production), the DCI (the decarbonization 
index), the Opinion Survey or occupational safety (accident fig-
ures). Navistar is included in the diversity index. In the financial 
data, our joint ventures in China are reported using the equity ac-
counting method. However, they are included in full (100%) in 
volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) and in 
production-related environmentally relevant data. The manage-
ment approaches described in this report (e.g. the environmen-
tal compliance management system [ECMS] and the compliance 
management system for business and human rights [CMS BHR]) 
apply to all the Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies. With 
our non controlled companies – i.e. companies that are not con-
trolled by a company of the Volkswagen Group as the majority 
owner – we work to the extent permitted by law toward imple-
mentation of the adjusted management approaches. The Chinese 
joint ventures are included in the information on the 
Volkswagen Group in the KPIs and the associated targets on the 
topics of the UEP (the reduction of the environmental impact of 
production), the DCI (the decarbonization index), the Opinion 
Survey, the diversity index, accident indices and accident fig-
ures. The risks of the Chinese market are assessed by Volkswagen 
China Investment Company Ltd.  
 
The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators pre-
sented in previous years. Any material changes to the methods 
used to collect and measure the data on our sustainability per-
formance are explicitly disclosed by the respective KPIs. All fig-
ures shown in the report are rounded, so minor discrepancies 
may arise from addition of these amounts. 
REPORT AUDITING
Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (EY) con-
ducted a voluntary, limited assurance engagement in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the combined separate nonfinancial 
report prepared in accordance with HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 
315b para. 3 to verify that its disclosures comply with the relevant 
statutory requirements. Further information on the engagement 
can be found in the independent practitioner’s report on a limited 
assurance engagement on the nonfinancial reporting.
DISCLOSURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNUAL  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Connections have been identified in this combined nonfinancial 
report to amounts reported in the 2021 annual or consolidated 
financial statements. In fiscal year 2021, negative special items 
in connection with the diesel issue amounting to € -0.8 billion 
affected operating profit in the Passenger Cars business area. To 
hedge the currently known legal risks related to the diesel issue, 
the provisions for litigation and legal risks as of December 31, 
2021 include an amount of around  € 2.1 billion, based on exist-
ing information and current assessments. Insofar as these can 
be adequately measured at this stage, contingent liabilities relat-
ing to the diesel issue were disclosed in the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements in an aggregate amount of € 4.3 bil-
lion, whereby € 3.6 billion of this amount results from lawsuits 
filed by investors in Germany. The provisions recognized, the 
contingent liabilities disclosed, and the other latent legal risks in 
the context of the diesel issue are in part subject to substantial 
estimation risks given the complexity of the individual relevant 
factors, the ongoing coordination with the authorities, and the 
fact that the fact-finding efforts have not yet been concluded. 
Should these legal or estimation risks materialize, this could re-
sult in further substantial financial charges. In particular, ad-
justment of the provisions recognized in light of knowledge ac-
quired or events occurring in the future cannot be ruled out. The 
remaining provisions relate to a wide range of identifiable indi-
vidual risks, price risks and contingent liabilities, which are fac-
tored in in the amount of their probable occurrence. Depending 
on the jurisdiction concerned, risk provisions for any non-com-
pliance with statutory emissions limits are also included. Their 
measurement takes into account, among other things, the  
respective sales volume and the legally defined tax or the cost of 
acquiring emission rights from other manufacturers. Advantage 
has been taken of synergies between individual brands of the 
Volkswagen Group by establishing emission pools where possible. 
Additional information on this matter and the valuation as-
sumptions and bases can be found in the Annual Report in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
ADDITIONAL REPORTING WITHIN THE GROUP
By referencing this combined separate nonfinancial report, all 
Group companies that are required by national legislation to  
disclose nonfinancial and diversity-related information pursuant 
to Directive 2014/95/EU but do not issue their own nonfinancial 
statement are exempted from the obligation to submit their own 
nonfinancial reports.  
TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO CLIMATE PROTECTION
The use of the term CO2 emissions in this report includes the 
consideration and identification of the additional climate-dam-
aging greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and laughing gas (N2O) 
(CO2 equivalents). All figures in this report on CO2 emissions cor-
respond to CO2 equivalents, except for fleet emission figures.
Net carbon neutrality is achieved when anthropogenic CO2 emis-
sions are balanced worldwide through avoidance, reduction and 
offsetting over a specific period of time. With regard to climate 
protection, in addition to CO2 emissions Volkswagen also pays 
8
A B O U T  T H I S  R E P O R T
attention to other relevant greenhouse gases. Avoidance and re-
duction have priority over offsetting for the Volkswagen Group. 
For offsetting measures, the Group follows the highest inter-
nationally established standards. 
EDITORIAL NOTES
Whenever this report uses the term Sustainability Report, this ex-
pression includes the nonfinancial report each time it is men-
tioned, to the extent described on page 7 .
REPORTING PRACTICES
The nonfinancial report is published annually. The last non-
financial report was published on March 16, 2021. In addition to 
information about the Group’s sustainability activities in the 
2021 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2021), this 2021 non-
financial report also contains selected information from the 
2022 fiscal year. 
ABOUT THIS REPORT 
The editorial deadline was Friday, February 11, 2022. The Group 
Sustainability Report is published in German and English and is 
released in the first quarter of 2022.  
 
LEGAL INFORMATION 
This sustainability report contains statements relating to the  
future business development of the Volkswagen Group. These 
statements are based on assumptions relating to the develop-
ment of the economic, political and legal environment in indi-
vidual countries, economic regions and markets, and in particular 
for the automotive industry, which we have made on the basis of 
the information available to us and which we consider to be real-
istic as of the time of going to press. The estimates given involve 
a degree of risk, and the actual developments may differ from 
those forecast. Any changes in significant parameters relating to 
our key sales markets, any significant shifts in exchange rates or 
commodities relevant to the Volkswagen Group or in parts supply 
(especially semiconductors), or any deviations in the actual effects 
of the COVID-19 pandemic from the scenario presented in this re-
port will have a corresponding effect on the development of our 
business. In addition, there may be departures from our expected 
business development if the assessments of the factors influencing 
sustainable value enhancement, and of risks and opportunities, 
presented in this sustainability report develop in a way other 
than we expect at the time of publication, or if additional risks 
and opportunities or other factors that affect the development of 
our business emerge.

ORGANIZATIONAL 
STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multi-brand groups in 
the automotive industry. The Group’s business activities comprise 
the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All brands within 
the Automotive Division – with the exception of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands – are 
independent legal entities. The Automotive Division comprises the 
Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering busi-
ness areas. The Passenger Cars Business Area essentially consoli-
dates the Volkswagen Group’s passenger car brands and the 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand. Activities focus on the de-
velopment of vehicles, engines and vehicle software, the produc-
tion and sale of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, and 
the genuine parts business. The product portfolio extends from 
small cars through to luxury vehicles in the premium segment. It 
also includes motorcycles and is supplemented by mobility solu-
tions. With its brands, the Volkswagen Group is present in all rele-
vant markets around the world. The key sales markets currently  
include Western Europe, China, the USA, Brazil, Russia, Mexico,  
Poland and Turkey.
Responsibilities were divided between ten Board of Management 
positions until December 31, 2021. In addition to the Chair of the 
Board of Management, which also includes the Volume brand 
group, the other Board positions are Purchasing, Technology, Fi-
nance, Human Resources and Truck & Bus, Integrity and Legal 
Affairs, Premium, Sport & Luxury, and China. Until December 31, 
2021, the Chair of the Board of Management was also responsible 
for China and the Board member for IT was also responsible for 
Finance. Since February 1, 2022, a separate Board member has 
been responsible for the IT Board position. The Board position 
with responsibility for China was once again allocated to a dedi-
cated Board member, to take effect on August 1, 2022. 
Alongside the brand groups, Volkswagen continued to build the 
Group company CARIAD SE in the reporting year. It is pooling and 
expanding the Volkswagen Group’s software expertise and will of-
fer a standardized operating system for the vehicles of the Group 
brands. 
Effective from the beginning of 2021, the former Components & 
Procurement Board division was split up and two new Board posi-
tions created for Procurement and Technology. The new Technol-
ogy Board position will be responsible for all Group Components 
activities across the Group, the marketing of the Volkswagen plat-
forms to third parties, the development and manufacturing of 
battery cells as well as the associated procurement, the areas of 
charging and charging systems ,and the corresponding joint  
ventures worldwide.

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
The Supervisory Board resolved in December 2021 to increase the 
number of members in the Group Board of Management and to re-
organize the structure and functions of the Board of Management 
in this context. The new Board position, Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars, was established with effect from January 1, 2022. Another 
new Board position, Group Sales, was created effective February 1, 
2022. 
The “Volume” brand group comprises the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars, SEAT/CUPRA, ŠKODA and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
brands. Since March 1, 2021, Bentley has been assigned to the 
“Premium” brand group, which previously comprised the Audi, 
Lambor ghini and Ducati brands. Following the departure of 
Bugatti from the Group’s brand portfolio in November 2021,  
the Sport & Luxury brand group now only comprises the Porsche 
brand. The Truck & Bus brand group is the umbrella for the Scania, 
MAN and Navistar commercial vehicles brands.
Our management model means better use can be made of exist-
ing skills and economies of scale, synergy effects can be boost-
ed more systematically and decision-making can be accelerated. 
In addition, this prepares the Volkswagen Group for a manage-
ment structure that is simpler, leaner and more effective, and 
strengthens the brands, giving them more autonomy. In line 
with the principle of subsidiarity, decisions will be taken at the 
lowest competent level, close to business operations. For fur-
ther information, see the “Structure and Business Activities” 
chapter in the Annual Report.

LEGAL FACTORS INFLUENCING BUSINESS
Like other international companies, the business of Volkswagen 
companies is affected by numerous laws, domestically and 
abroad. In particular, there are legal requirements relating to 
services, development, products, production and distribution, 
as well as supervisory, data protection, financial, company, 
commercial, capital market, anti-trust and tax regulations as 
well as regulations relating to labor, banking, state-aid, energy, 
environmental and insurance law.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
The Volkswagen Group is further advancing its transformation to a digital mobility group and will invest around € 89 billion in future  
technologies such as electric mobility and digitalization in the next five years.
PROCUREMENT
Every year, the Volkswagen Group purchases a wide range of raw materials, components and other goods. A sustainable supply chain and 
environmentally compatible transportation are important for fully assuming responsibility for human rights, environmental protection and the 
battle against corruption.
PRODUCTION
Every working day, the Volkswagen Group manufactures an average of around 33,000 vehicles globally. Efficient production ranks alongside  
environmental protection and employee health and safety as one of our core goals.
MARKETING & SALES
Business relationships with fleet customers are often long-term and stable partnerships. The Volkswagen Group’s share of commercial fleet  
customers is 42.1% in Germany and 26.5% in the rest of Europe.
AFTER-SALES & FINANCIAL SERVICES
Our service includes supporting dealerships to ensure they can provide quality advice and maintenance, managing our original parts business, 
and providing vehicle-related financial services.
RECYCLING
In addition to recycling vehicles at the end of their useful life, we pay close attention during the new-vehicle development stage to the  
recyclability of the required materials, the use of high-quality recycled materials, and the avoidance of pollutants.

organization and values, and the principles and guidelines for its 
business policy. The German Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code) contains principles, recommendations and suggestions for 
corporate management and supervision. Its principles, recommen-
dations and suggestions were prepared by a dedicated government 
commission on the basis of the material provisions and nationally 
and internationally accepted standards of sound, responsible cor-
porate governance. In the interests of best practice, the government 
commission regularly reviews the Code’s relevance in light of cur-
rent developments and updates it as necessary. The Board of Man-
agement and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG base their 
work on the Code’s principles, recommendations and suggestions. 
We consider good corporate governance to be a key prerequisite for 
achieving a lasting increase in the Company’s value. It helps 
strengthen the trust of our shareholders, customers, employees, 
business partners and investors in our work and enables us to meet 
the steadily increasing demand for information from national and 
international stakeholders. You can find our published Declaration 
of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code here:

In 2021, the Volkswagen AG Group Board of Management adopted 
an update of the tax strategy principles, which can be found on our 
website. 
Each year, Volkswagen AG sends the German Federal Central Tax 
Office a country-by-country report, which includes information on 
tax payments and tax expenses/income by country. 
The Volkswagen Group has the ambition of implementing its mar-
keting and communication activities transparently and responsibly. 
This includes attentiveness towards our environment and requires 
us to treat all individuals with respect and honesty and as equals. 
This applies internally and externally, online and off. To this end, the 
Group has developed principles that serve as a compass for imple-
menting the Volkswagen Group’s values with regard to marketing 
and communication activities.

NEW AUTO GROUP STRATEGY
With the new Group strategy “NEW AUTO – Mobility for Genera-
tions to Come”, we are preparing ourselves for the global changes 
in mobility and thus driving Volkswagen’s transformation into a 
software-driven company.
With the TOGETHER 2025+ Group strategy, which the Group  
enhanced in 2019, Volkswagen kicked off one of the biggest pro-
cesses of change in its corporate history with the aim of making 
the Group more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented 
and sustainable, and systematically gearing it toward profitable 
growth. These strategies have provided the framework and key 
pillars with which we aim to achieve our vision of being a world- 
leading provider of sustainable mobility. 
As technology advances, the automotive industry is forging ahead 
with the transformation toward e-mobility and digitalization. The 
market for electric vehicles will thus continue to grow strongly in 
the next few years, meaning that cost-efficient and sustainable pro-
duction of battery systems and the expansion of charging infra-
structure will be crucial to success. 
The shift to connected, intelligent and eventually self-driving 
vehicles, however, will bring more wide-reaching changes for the 
automotive industry. This shift will be dependent on increasing 
software development capabilities so as to excite customers with 
constantly improving digital functionality. The most important 
milestone in this context is the development of autonomous driv-
ing, which will change customers’ experience of mobility forever 
and pave the way to new business models. 
As with technological trends, global economic as well as geopolitical 
constraints are increasingly confronting the automobile industry 
with greater challenges, for example the economic influence wield-
ed by our biggest mobility markets, China, USA and Europe, and the 
way they are diverging. The Chinese economy will continue to gain 
influence and grow rapidly. The enormous growth in economic 
output (GDP) underlines the importance of the Asian market. 
Sustainability will continue to be a recurring theme in the business 
world, driven by the increasingly noticeable consequences of cli-
mate change and customers’ greater awareness of sustainable 
lifestyles.
In the context of the fast-changing environment and the challenges 
resulting from it, the Group Board of Management adopted the 
new Group strategy “NEW AUTO – Mobility for Generations to 
Come” in May 2021 with the approval of the Supervisory Board. The 
strategy’s focus is the world of mobility in 2030. With NEW AU-
TO, we are  
resetting our priorities and developing the necessary expertise as 
we continue our transition from automotive manufacturer to  
mobility group. Alongside software development and capabilities 
in autonomous driving, this also includes areas such as battery 
technology, battery recycling, charging infrastructure and mobility 
services.
THE 12 INITIATIVES OF THE NEW AUTO STRATEGY
The Group strategy consists of 12 initiatives in total. The focus is  
on the technology initiatives Mechatronics, Software, Battery, 
Charging and Mobility Solutions. A further seven initiatives form 
the basis for the Volkswagen Group’s strategic realignment. These 
are ESG, Decarbonization & Integrity, Business Model 2.0, NAR and 
China Regions, Group Steering Model, People & Transformation, 
and Financing the Transformation. 
To make the goals of the strategy’s various initiatives as transparent 
as possible for management and employees, the Group Board of 
Management has decided to structure and regularly measure the 
strategic goals and milestones using the OKR (objectives and key 
results) method. This means that, for each initiative, achievable  
objectives will be defined for each quarter along with envisaged 
key results, and their progress discussed with the Board of Manage-
ment every three months. 
MECHATRONICS
Innovation, technology and lasting competitiveness are to be en-
sured using a future-oriented mechatronics platform. A standard 
platform known as the SSP – Scalable Systems Platform will enable 
maximum synergy effects, reduced investment costs and fast,  
regular technology updates, while also providing the necessary 
product differentiation in the Group’s portfolio. It will form the  
basis for autonomous driving and help us offer electric cars for all.
SOFTWARE
Software-based customer functions (such as driver assistance sys-
tems) have already improved driving comfort and vehicle safety 
significantly. As vehicles become fully connected in future and  
increasingly complex software technologies are developed (for  
instance with the aid of artificial intelligence), a completely new  
experience of mobility and additional product differentiation will 
become possible, due in part to the development of automated 
driving. To maximize synergies in the development of software 
platforms and software-driven customer functions, the Volkswagen 
Group will combine this development expertise with CARIAD’s 
new software architecture E³ 2.0. The Software strategy initiative 
thus comprises measures to drive the development of software 
platforms for connectivity and automated driving and their roll-
out to all the Group’s vehicles. 
BATTERY
Energy, batteries and charging are becoming one of our core 
competencies. To achieve our strategic objectives, we must  
become a profitable expert along the entire battery life cycle.  
To this end, the Cell and Battery Strategy initiative will pool ex-
pertise from all across the Group and drive the transformation 
process together with our strategic partners. 
14
S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
CHARGING
Coordinated and cohesive cooperation within the Group is 
needed to establish Volkswagen as a global, comprehensive 
charging and energy services provider in future. The Charging 
and Energy Services initiative will combine related activities 
across the brands, create synergies and drive the creation of a 
dense and comprehensive charging network. 
MOBILITY SOLUTIONS
With the motto “Mobility for Generations to Come”, the 
Volkswagen Group is developing the mobility solutions of the 
future, taking into account global trends and changing customer 
needs. Autonomous driving, combined with new mobility  
solutions, is expected to mark Volkswagen’s transformation  
into one of the leading providers of sustainable mobility.
ESG, DECARBONIZATION & INTEGRITY
ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) refers to the basic 
principles of doing business sustainably. The Group’s stakehold-
ers (e.g. investors, employees, customers and NGOs) have high 
expectations of the Company’s ESG performance, including on 
issues such as decarbonization and integrity. The ESG perfor-
mance thus directly affects the Group’s market capitalization 
and the cost of capital as well as, for example, its attractiveness 
as an employer. The ESG Group initiative therefore aims to  
improve the Group’s ESG performance in order, among other 
things, to ensure it can attract investment and to optimize its 
cost of capital.
BUSINESS MODEL 2.0
By connecting vehicles, we will be able in future to remain in 
contact with customers throughout the vehicle life cycle and 
thus to offer them services and functions for their individual 
needs. The Business Model 2.0 initiative is developing a Group-
wide portfolio of services that aims to create a seamless and  
innovative product experience to connect brands, customers, 
dealerships, our partners and whole markets.
NORTH AMERICA REGION (NAR)
North America is the region with the greatest growth potential for 
the Volkswagen Group, especially in e-mobility. In the United States, 
Volkswagen is putting a wide range of highly attractive electric ve-
hicles on the roads, tailored to the market. The Group is positioning 
itself for the future ready to leverage the growth of an increasingly 
electrified market using its brands, products and services. The aim 
is to increase market share in e-mobility. 
CHINA REGION
China is of major strategic significance to the Volkswagen Group 
as its most important individual market. A large share of vehicle 
sales is concentrated on this growth market. This strategy initia-
tive therefore brings together all key measures to continue the 
success story of Volkswagen in China. It includes a comprehen-
sive program of measures to expand market share in the electric 
vehicle segment and safeguard market share in combustion en-
gine models. The core component remains a Group-wide local-
ization strategy, which aims to offer Chinese customers tailored 
products using globally developed platform technologies (hard-
ware and software). 
GROUP STEERING MODEL
To implement the Group strategy and achieve long-term success 
for the Volkswagen Group, we need to establish mechanisms for 
making swift decisions and realizing synergy effects at a consis-
tently high level and keep enhancing them further. The updated 
Group steering model hones the definition of responsibilities 
and roles and provides transparency, thus strengthening collab-
oration within the Group. Combined with a reoriented financial 
management along the brand groups and cross-brand value drivers, 
the Volkswagen Group is creating a future-oriented governance 
model to match the changing environment.
PEOPLE & TRANSFORMATION
With its intended transformation into a global tech company, 
the Volkswagen Group will undertake the biggest transforma-
tion of its workforce in its history. To ensure the Group remains 
competitive in future, we need to attract and retain top talent 
and support employees with extensive training provision. 
Aligning the structure of the workforce with the fields that will 
drive the future will also be centrally important.
FINANCING THE TRANSFORMATION 
The transformation being driven by digitalization and electrifi-
cation will require substantial investment. To cover this financing 
requirement, the “Financing the Transformation” initiative  
intends, in the light of the two issues of costs and efficiency,  
to leverage even more Group-wide synergies across all areas of  
activity along the value chain. The initiative therefore includes 
multiple action areas, such as productivity increases at plants 
and measures to optimize cash flows in the Group.
GROUP STRATEGY GOALS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
The 12 newly defined initiatives describe how we want to achieve 
our goals of mobility for today’s generation and those of tomorrow. 
Our strategy will also be guided by four overarching target dimen-
sions. The four target dimensions here are: excited customers; ex-
cellent employer; role model for the environment, safety and integ-
rity; and competitive profitability. We want to grow sustainably by 
consistently pursuing these objectives. The target dimensions ap-
ply throughout the whole Group. The strategic KPIs that we use to 
measure how well we have implemented our Group strategy are de-
pendent on the respective business model.
15
S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
As the new Group strategy is currently being specified and en-
hanced in detail, the content and adjusted 2030 strategic KPI 
targets in the target dimensions are still being determined. The 
relevance of the KPIs is reviewed at Group level and their focus 
is continuously monitored and adjusted as necessary. We report 
on the defined nonfinancial strategic KPIs in the “Sustainable 
Value Enhancement” chapter of the 2021 Annual Report. 
Target Dimension: Excited Customers
This target dimension focuses on the diverse needs of our cus-
tomers and on tailor-made mobility solutions. We aspire to ex-
ceed our customers’ expectations, thus generating maximum 
customer benefit. This requires not only the best products, the 
most efficient solutions and the best service, but also flawless 
quality and an outstanding image. We want to excite our exist-
ing customers, win over new ones and retain their loyalty in  
the long term – because only loyal and faithful customers will  
recommend us to others.
The strategic KPIs consist of the conquest rate and KPIs per-
taining to loyalty, customer satisfaction and quality.
Target Dimension: Excellent Employer
To achieve sustainable success, we need skilled and dedicated 
employees. We aim to increase their satisfaction and motivation 
by means of equal opportunities, an attractive and modern 
working environment, and a forward-looking organization of 
work. An exemplary management and corporate culture forms 
the basis for this, allowing us to retain our core workforce and 
attract new talent.
The strategic KPIs of this target dimension cover internal em-
ployer attractiveness determined by means of the Opinion Sur-
vey, external employer attractiveness, an external employer 
ranking as well as the diversity index.
Target Dimension: Role Model for the Environment,  
Safety and Integrity
Every day, we at the Volkswagen Group assume and exercise  
responsibility in issues relating to the environment, safety and 
society. This commitment should be reflected both in our 
thoughts and actions and in all our decisions. We pay particular 
attention to the use of resources and the emissions of our product 
portfolio, sites and plants. Our goal is to continuously reduce 
our carbon footprint and lower our pollutant emissions. 
Through innovations and outstanding quality, we aim for high 
product safety. 
Our primary objectives in this process include complying with 
laws and regulations, establishing secure processes and dealing 
openly with mistakes so that they can be avoided or rectified in 
the future. In terms of integrity, Volkswagen aims to become a 
role model for a modern, transparent and successful enterprise.

STRATEGIC KPIS:  
COMPETITIVE PROFITABILITY
The strategic KPIs for this target dimension include the decar-
bonization index, CO₂ fleet emissions, compliance, integrity and  
a culture of dealing openly with mistakes. 
Target Dimension: Competitive Profitability
Investors judge us by whether we are able to meet our obligations 
as regards interest payments and debt repayments. As equity 
holders, they expect appropriate dividends and a long-term value 
enhancement of their shares.
We make investments with a view to achieving profitable growth 
and strengthening our competitiveness, thus keeping the 
Volkswagen Group on a firm footing in the future and ensuring it 
remains an attractive investment option. 
The goals we have set ourselves are operational excellence in all 
business processes and becoming the benchmark for the entire  
industry.  
The strategic KPIs are operationalized for internal management 
purposes: target and actual data are derived from Volkswagen 
Group figures.

ESG PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND 
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS LINKED WITH GROUP STRATEGY 
AND ESG PERFORMANCE
The materiality process is used to identify and evaluate the most 
important sustainability issues for the Group. The decisive factors 
here are impact on the environment and society, stakeholder ex-
pectations, key ESG requirements, the Volkswagen AG business 
model and compliance with legal requirements and internationally 
established reporting standards.
The Group conducted another materiality analysis in the report-
ing period. In reviewing a large number of potentially material 
issues, we considered both external and internal company per-
spectives. The external side related to, for example, results of  
dialog processes with the Sustainability Council and the Stake-
holder Panel, reputation surveys, the requirements of relevant 
international and national frameworks, such as the EU taxono-
my, the UN Global Compact, the Sustainability Accounting Stan-
dards Board (SASB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the 
UN Sustainability Development Goals (UN SDGs) or the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), and to key ESG  
ratings and trend analyses and benchmark studies.
The internal dimension incorporated in particular Group guide-
lines on sustainability management, materiality analyses of 
Group brands, interviews with sustainability officers working in 
Group functions, country-specific risk analyses of Volkswagen 
Group production plants, impact analyses of financial effective-
ness in the focus areas using AI-supported analysis of 250 ESG 
criteria and evaluation of 30,000 public media sources in 170 
countries and at 700 NGOs plus an SDG survey of Volkswagen AG 
sustainability experts. 
When the Group’s NEW AUTO strategy was being developed, the 
selection of focus issues was also reflected on in the context of 
the financial and capital market requirements. As a result, the 
four defined focus areas of decarbonization, circular economy, 
responsibility for supply chains and business, as well as people 
in the transformation were confirmed from the 2020 materiality 
analysis, and in 2021 the two focus areas of diversity and integrity 
were added and classified as being material by the Group Steer-
ing Committee for Sustainability. These six focus areas, in turn, 
cover most of the requirements formulated from the ESG ratings 
for assessment criteria applied:
• Decarbonization
• Circular economy
•  Responsibility for supply chains and business
•  Diversity
•  People in the transformation
•  Integrity
Each focus issue is connected with a clear ambition, targets and 
milestones, possible KPIs and packages of measures. ESG-related 
KPIs such as the decarbonization index and the diversity index 
are already reflected in the remuneration of members of the Board 
of Management. 
 
 Corporate Governance
The topics classified as material also provide the foundation for 
the structure of this sustainability report and serve as the basis 
for managing the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability program.
ACTION PROGRAM FOR OPTIMIZED ESG PERFORMANCE
The NEW AUTO Group strategy focuses not only on technological 
and product-related initiatives but also on improving the Group’s 
ESG performance. This is because this directly impacts market 
capitalization, costs of capital and investability. This is partly 
due to increasing density of regulations on sustainability as a  
result of frameworks such as the EU taxonomy or regulations on 
the responsible shaping of supply chains. Moreover, capital  
market players such as institutional investors not only expect 
transparency on the Group’s sustainability performance but also 
the demonstration of clear ambitions, strategic decisions and im-
provement measures. An estimated 35% of global fixed assets are 
already managed in accordance with ESG requirements today.
In the past reporting year, we started an action program that  
targets significant improvement of our results in ESG ratings  
by 2025. It consists of four pillars: 
1. ESG performance management: We close existing gaps in ESG 
performance and create additional transparency by disclosing 
our measures and key performance indicators. 
2. ESG engagement: We increase our communication presence  
in the capital market by communicating our messages and re-
sults in roadshows, investor conferences and other formats.  
In this way, we solicit trust and at the same time benefit from 
the learning effects and knowledge that this dialog makes 
possible.

3. Management of media controversies: We aim to reduce the nega-
tive impact of legal or media controversies regarding the 
Volkswagen Group on our rating results. The reinstatement in 
the UN Global Compact is an important milestone here. Our own 
Web-based information on existing ESG controversies around 
Volkswagen makes an additional contribution to clarification and 
objectivization.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Investor Relations > Corporate 
Governance > ESG Controversies
4. Internal ESG data infrastructure: We are working on establishing 
comprehensive ESG data reporting tools for better data-support-
ed infrastructure and will create comprehensive and custom ESG 
information offerings for relevant stakeholders in the future.
Compared with prior years, the Group’s assessment in the various  
ESG ratings, such as MSCI and Sustainalytics, has substantially im-
proved. In fiscal year 2021, Volkswagen continued to have a score 
of A– in the CDP climate rating and had an A rating in the Water 
Disclosure Project (WDP).
MAKING THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  
OF OUR ACTIONS MEASURABLE
The Volkswagen Group wants to measure the impact of its ac-
tions even more precisely in quantitative terms in the future 
and, if possible and reasonable, to monetize this. This involves as-
sessing positive and negative effects on, among other things, the 
environment and society for the purpose of the inside-out per-
spective, which is one of the two cornerstones of the double ma-
teriality view. This impact relates to the Group’s entire business, 
including its supply chain and its products and services. This 
means we are not only taking on board impetus from regulatory 
developments as it emanates from the EU CSR Directive or the EU 
Green Bond Standard, but also impetus from international initia-
tives and organizations such as the OECD and the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). At the same time, 
like other global companies, we are endeavoring to make even 
greater use of an impact assessment in our decision-making and 
management processes, risk management, reporting and com-
munication with our stakeholders. Impact assessments already 
represent tried and tested tools at Volkswagen, particularly for 
the assessment of mobility concepts. Here, new options are con-
tinuously investigated for their sustainability impact and read-
justed as necessary.
 
 Sustainability Impact of New Mobility Options
The results of two pilot projects with the title “Impact Valuation@
Volkswagen Group” form the basis of a future Group-wide con-
cept. In order to advance the topic of impact measurement and 
develop comparable concepts, the Volkswagen Group joined the 
Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) together with the Porsche brand. 
This initiative champions the development of uniform  
assessment standards for impact measurement and the financial 
balancing of sustainability impacts on an international level 
across sectors. In addition to the Volkswagen Group, the VBA’s 
members include numerous global companies, such as Bosch, 
BASF, BMW, SAP, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings and Novartis.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURE AND TASKS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY ORGANIZATION
Sustainability means maintaining intact environmental, social 
and economic systems with long-term viability at global, regional 
and local level. The Volkswagen Group can influence these systems 
in various ways and actively takes responsibility to make a con-
tribution to their sustainability. An extensive sustainability 
management system was set up for this purpose. The related 
structures, processes and responsibilities are codified in a specific 
Group policy. We view sustainability management as a continuous 
improvement process (CIP).
The Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG has 
cross-functional overall responsibility for sustainability. Addi-
tional responsibility is taken by members of the Board of Manage-
ment with their responsibility for specific management systems 
relating to sustainability and by the Group Steering Committee 
for Sustainability. The members of this steering committee  
include managers from central Board of Management business  
areas and Group functions, representatives of the brands and the 
Group Works Council. The steering committee defines concrete 
strategic targets and programs, sets out measures for uniform 
cross-business-area, cross-brand and cross-regional development 
of sustainability management and makes decisions on sustain-
ability-related basic issues and positions in the Volkswagen 
Group.
The Group’s sustainability function (Group Sustainability) coor-
dinates all sustainability-related activities and the Group-wide 
and cross-functional network for sustainability. Communication 
with Group functions, brands and companies is structured via 
defined core processes. They serve to create transparency on ex-
ternal requirements and translate these into corporate action. 
The core processes include the sustainability strategy and ma-
teriality analysis, stakeholder management, ratings and rank-
ings, sustainability policies and sustainability reporting. Group 
Sustainability is allocated to Group strategy and the Office of 
the Corporate Secretary in order to ensure that sustainability is 
closely linked with the strategic corporate goals and the core 
business. It is also responsible for the office of the Group Steer-
ing Committee for Sustainability.
In addition to the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability, 
regular discussions within the Group-wide sustainability network 
take place through various formats, such as the Group Sustain-
ability Summit or the Sustainability Manager Core Team Meet-
ing (SMCT), which was newly established in the reporting year.  
At brand level, the brand sustainability managers carry out the 
cross-functional coordination of sustainability topics, develop 
the sustainability strategy, are responsible for content and re-
porting on sustainability topics within the brand, represent the 
brand on sustainability topics externally and coordinate with 
Group Sustainability.
THE SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL AS AN INDEPENDENT 
DRIVING FORCE AND PARTNER
At Group level, the Sustainability Council has a prominent position. 
This advisory committee, which was created in 2016, supports 
the Volkswagen Group with important strategic sustainability 
topics and is made up of internationally renowned experts from 
the academic world, politics and society. The committee establishes

representatives. 
Dialog between Volkswagen and the Sustainability Council in 
2021 focused on the new Group strategy, NEW AUTO, with the vi-
sion “Mobility for Generations to Come” and the topics of ESG and 
commitment to climate protection. The committee also dealt 
with the stage of development of Volkswagen’s decarbonization 
has reached, progress in creating sustainable supply chains, the 
efforts for more diversity in the workforce, the workforce trans-
formation, circular economy, anti-corruption and the topic of  
zero impact mobility. After its meetings, the Sustainability Council 
addressed its recommendations on these and other aspects to the 
Group Board of Management. The published letters of recommen-
dation are available on the Sustainability Committee’s website. 
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Strategy &  
Reporting > Engagement > Sustainability Council
In addition, the committee launched a project to examine digi-
talization in its capacity as an enabler for sustainability. A study 
was also launched on the potential of future forms of work and 
training to shape the transformation. The study builds on the  
results of the employment study initiated by the Sustainability 
Council with the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering 
IAO, which was published at the end of 2020. The research project 
with the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and 
Climate Change (MCC), which was begun in the previous year,  
focused on, among other things, dialog organized jointly with 
the OECD on the inclusivity and effectiveness of climate legislation 
in the transport sector and conducting initial analyses.
REINSTATEMENT IN THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT
In 2021, after a five-year hiatus, the Volkswagen Group was offi-
cially reinstated as a participant of the UN Global Compact, the 
world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. A correspond-
ing request by the Chairman of the Volkswagen Group’s Manage-
ment Board for renewed participation was granted. The relevant 
letter of recommitment signed by the Chairman of the Board of 
Management and the confirmation of the reinstatement by the 
UN Global Compact can be found on the organization’s website. 
The Group had been removed from the list of members in the 
wake of the diesel issue. The Volkswagen Group had already been 
a participant of the UN Global Compact since August 2002. Even 
after removal from the list of participants, the Group had  
continued reporting to the UN Global Compact in the subsequent 
years and sought reinstatement. In the reporting year, the 
Volkswagen Group participated in the Climate Ambition Accel-
erator and in the Target Gender Equality Initiative.
The decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Volkswagen 
Group’s completely rebuilt compliance and integrity policy as a 
result of the successfully concluded Monitorship supervised by 
the U.S. Department of Justice. The Group’s ambitious climate 
protection program and the appointment of an independent  
Sustainability Council also played a key role. 
For investors and asset managers in the capital market, member-
ship of the UN Global Compact is an important criterion for invest-
ability in Volkswagen AG shares and bonds. Sustainability ori-
ented funds have grown significantly in the last few years and 
have become indispensable as stakeholders.
GREEN FINANCE FRAMEWORK FOR 
INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABILITY
Massive investment is needed to transform the Volkswagen 
Group. At the same time, investors are looking for sustainable  
investment options. Volkswagen AG has had a Green Finance 
Framework for various forms of financing such as green bonds 
since 2020. This document defines the framework for financial 
instruments geared to sustainability and systematically links  
our corporate objective of net carbon neutrality by 2050 with our 
financing strategy. The funds raised under the Green Finance 
Framework are specifically used on environmentally friendly 
projects such as e-mobility. This both fulfills the clean transpor-
tation category of the Green Bond Principles of the International 
Capital Market Association (ICMA) and is in line with the goals  
of the United Nations and the European Union for sustainable de-
velopment. Sustainalytics has confirmed that the Green Finance 
Framework complies with the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles and 
the Green Loan Principles of the Loan Market Association (LMA). 
Volkswagen published the Green Finance Report, which contains 
the Allocation Report and the Impact Report, for the first time 
during the reporting year. More information is available on our 
corporate website under the heading of Green Finance.

SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT 
OF NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS
MAKING MOBILITY SOLUTIONS MEASURABLY  
MORE SUSTAINABLE 
Our global society today faces the major challenge of finding 
the right balance when shaping mobility. Both overloading and 
deficits exist concurrently: the limits for noise, traffic jams, acci-
dents, parking space or poor air quality have been reached or ex-
ceeded in many major cities. At the same time, there are too few 
means of transportation for many people or the transport is too 
expensive for them, limiting people’s access to and participation 
in society. This is not only the case in the economically weaker 
countries but also in rural areas or suburbs of industrialized 
countries.
The Volkswagen Group offers both innovative vehicle technologies 
and forward-looking mobility services, with which the Group 
wants to meet its customers’ requirements but can also help to 
solve local environmental and traffic problems in urban and rural 
areas and to protect the climate worldwide. The global coopera-
tion with partners outside the Group plays an important role. We 
are guided here by the “Mobility for Generations to Come” vision 
that our NEW AUTO Group strategy describes.
 
 NEW AUTO Group Strategy
Our most important offerings include the ride-pooling service 
MOIA and WeShare as car sharing – both in all-electric operating 
mode. “Volkswagen We” is a growing range of vehicle-related digi-
tal services and mobility solutions that can be used in the car or 
with a smartphone. Shaping urban mobility plays a key role for 
the Volkswagen Group because many mobility options are primarily 
available in cities. According to the UN’s estimates, almost 70 % of 
the global population will live in cities by 2050. 
SIMULATION PLATFORM FOR MOBILITY CREATES 
TRANSPARENCY AND ENABLES IMPROVEMENTS
It has been shown many times that new mobility concepts in 
particular increase the range of options in urban areas but are 
not automatically sustainable. Creating a basis of assessment is 
therefore important so that mobility solutions can, on the one 
hand, be assessed for their sustainability impact and, on the other, 
can be influenced. This is because determining the right frame-
work conditions and regulations is of decisive importance to 
make substantial contributions to sustainable cities and tap into 
business models for the Group. Political players and cities are  
also increasingly requiring early proof that mobility solutions 
actually have sustainability effects, and this proof can become  
a component of approvals or long-term operation.
Against this background, a mobility simulation framework has 
been created as part of the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability 
management. Its focus is on impact assessments that digitally 
replicate mobility on the basis of real data. The use of simula-
tions means possible improvements – and also any undesirable 
side effects – can be discovered early.
Various key figures that are not only scientifically acknowledged 
but also reflect the requirements of various players are used in 
the evaluation. For example, short journey times are important 
for customers, while the reduction of CO₂ emissions is important 
for society; towns and cities for their part want traffic to occupy 
as little space as possible and improve air quality, while good  
utilization of its services is essential to the mobility provider. We 
are in regular communication with stakeholders on these and 
other issues and continuously analyze trends so that we can  
update targets and criteria as needed. The methods and model  
approaches for mobility simulation are being continuously de-
veloped in collaboration with universities. Moreover, real data 
and empirical figures from mobility providers are used for con-
tinuous improvement. The simulations and the results are used 
to improve our offerings, such as MOIA.
IMPACT ANALYSIS TOPICS
Measures for increasing the efficiency and better capacity utiliza-
tion of road transportation continue to be important steps on the 
path to sustainable mobility. Ride pooling and urban traffic-light 
intersections therefore remain focus issues for impact assess-
ments at Volkswagen. In the case of ride pooling services such as 
MOIA, the transport needs of various customers need to be 
linked as optimally as possible in order to balance detours and 
waiting times with capacity as well as possible. Modeling and 
impact assessments provide valuable services here in order to 
represent the high level of complexity. A simulation of traffic 
flows in the Hanover area showed that combined services for  
private individuals and businesses make ride pooling much more 
efficient and therefore more sustainable. For example, the utili-
zation of vehicles’ capacity falls sharply after the rush hour. This 
could be partially made up for by commercial customers – e.g. 
from restaurants, bars, the hotel industry and retail. Selected 
goods transport to avoid empty runs is also conceivable.
We have also further developed our impact assessment of urban 
traffic-light intersections, which represent a bottleneck in traffic 
capacity and traffic quality in towns and cities. A vehicle ap-
proaching the traffic-light intersection can, for example, avoid 
the time- and energy-inefficient maneuvers of braking and start-
ing if it is informed when the traffic light will go green in ad-
vance. The effects of self-driving vehicles entering complex 
traffic situations at intersections in future will also be 
examined. 
ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW POTENTIAL 
OF OPTIMIZED VEHICLE USE
The impact assessments provide important indications of the 
biggest levers for improving the sustainability impact, especially 
with regard to reducing carbon emissions and relieving the 
22
S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
shortage of space in cities. The focus is principally on the better 
use of vehicles here. In particular, privately used cars are mostly 
underutilized. On average, they are only used for around an hour 
per day and remain in parking spaces in private or public areas 
for the rest of the time, which in turn takes up valuable urban 
space. The life cycle of the vehicle is long, which leads to less en-
vironmentally friendly, outdated technologies being used for too 
long on the roads. By contrast, electric robotaxis could operate 
around-the-clock in the future and transport more people than 
today all at once in a single journey. Car sharing can increase the 
use of cars to several hours per day through multiple users using 
a vehicle one after another over the course of a day. Both solu-
tions lead to more efficient usage with fewer cars and less need for 
parking space in towns and cities. Combined use – the use of the 
same car for sharing, hire or with a subscription – may bring fur-
ther improvements in utilization time. Such multipurpose use of 
the fleet is possible with a virtual key through a smartphone. 
UNDERSTANDING URBAN MOBILITY ACROSS MODES OF 
TRANSPORT AND DEVELOPING IT SUSTAINABLY TOGETHER
The traffic-induced problems are the most urgent in urban cen-
ters, and the potential for change is also the greatest here. As a 
member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop-
ment (WBCSD) for many years, we seek dialog with other compa-
nies contributing to the transformation and with stakeholders  
in order to identify our own scope for action. For example, the 
Volkswagen Group also continued its collaboration on the WBSCD’s 
Transforming Urban Mobility (TUM) project in 2021. This includes 
the Commuter Behavior Change subproject, in which the compa-
nies taking part want to make not their products and services but 
rather the mobility of their own employees as commuters more 
sustainable. To this end, examples of use have been collected, expe-
rience has been shared and recommendations have been pub-
lished so that other companies can benefit too. 
Another focus was the “Mobility as a Service” (MaaS) project, 
which was jointly carried out by the WBCSD and the International 
Transport Forum (ITF) and was completed in the reporting year. 
As a result, mobility trends were identified and regulatory 
challenges and solutions through which MaaS can make a con-
tribution to people and society and allow providers a viable 
business model were presented. 
Through MOIA, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is a member of 
the MaaS Alliance, which is a public-private partnership organiza-
tion that has set itself the objective of creating an open platform 
for implementing MaaS projects. 
The Volkswagen Group sees itself as a close and reliable partner 
to cities. Various projects are already being developed, tested and 
implemented in collaborations around the world. The priority is 
the establishment of new technologies intended to reduce con-
gestion and environmental pollution. Our Group currently main-
tains partnerships with a large number of towns and cities, in-
cluding Hamburg, Hanover, Dresden and Wolfsburg in Germany 
and cities such as Prague and Barcelona internationally.

STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
STRATEGIC STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
Our stakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations who 
have a material influence on or are materially influenced by the 
way in which the Group reaches its corporate decisions and the 
implications of those decisions. Our customers and employees 
are at the center of our stakeholder network. Around this core, 
eight further groups have been identified. The Group’s supervisory 
and advisory bodies, such as the Supervisory Board, the Works 
Council and the Sustainability Council, act as a special interface  
between internal and external stakeholders.
GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43
For us, stakeholder management means interacting with the Com-
pany’s key stakeholder groups systematically and continuously as 
part of the Group initiative on ESG performance, decarbonization 
and integrity, which is part of the new Group strategy, NEW AUTO. 
Our stakeholder management aims for open, constructive and 
also critical communication with the stakeholder groups listed in 
the diagram about their requirements and expectations of us, as 
well as central issues of our Group strategy and its implementa-
tion. Our brands and regions have their own stakeholder activities. 
The Group’s task is to bring together these activities in an integrated 
stakeholder activity framework.  
 
This includes:
• stakeholder activities on a Group level with specific committees, 
formats and a focus on stakeholders relevant across the Group
• advising and coordinating the brands and regions on the imple-
mentation of their activities
• carrying out regular stakeholder analyses and stakeholder 
surveys
Stakeholder management is one of the core processes of sus-
tainability management in the Group. Tasks, responsibilities 
and organization are set out in the Group policy on sustain-
ability management.

As a global business, our business activities impact the lives of a 
very large number of different people. Internationally oriented, 
effective stakeholder management is increasingly important 
for the Volkswagen Group. This is not only the foundation for 
determining the sustainability strategy’s key action areas but  
also necessary for fulfilling the increasing expectations and 
communication requirements of our stakeholders, whose trust 
in the Volkswagen Group we want to continue to strengthen. 
Moreover, continuous communication with all the business areas 
is essential for achieving corporate goals and complying with  
reporting standards and other standards and legal requirements.
The transformation of the Volkswagen Group from a vehicle 
manufacturer to a world-leading, software-driven mobility provider 
and the development of areas of expertise such as autonomous 
driving, battery technology, charging infrastructure and energy 
services will change and expand the range of our stakeholders. 
Our goal is to involve all stakeholders in this transformation process 
through a continuous exchange of information and opinions. 
Better understanding the positions of our stakeholders and actively 
using their feedback for the sustainable development of our 
Group and society is key. That is the basis for positioning our 
Group robustly and also flexibly for the future under likewise 
constantly changing economic, environmental and social frame-
work conditions and sustainably improving our Group’s reputation 
and thus its acceptance. 
Our Group is a player in numerous networks of experts and de-
cision-makers who have a significant influence on our business 
and the agenda in the politico-social environment. An overview 
of the Group’s most important memberships is available on our 
website.

REPUTATION KPI REFLECTS STAKEHOLDER TRUST
The reputation key performance indicator (KPI) makes a decisive 
contribution to anchoring stakeholder management in the strategy. 
The indicator is based on the responses by external stakeholders in 
the Group reputation survey, which has been conducted annually 
since 2017, to the question about the degree to which they trust 
the Volkswagen Group. Eliciting this KPI enables a holistic view of 
attitudes and opinions on the Group and allows the identification 
of changes in evaluations over the course of time.
The Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen Passenger Cars brands are now 
consistently represented in the survey. The survey data are based 
on personal telephone interviews that are conducted with repre-
sentatives of importance to the Volkswagen Group from the 
fields of politics and associations, media, academia, NGOs, inves-
tors and analysts and also business partners in the three markets 
(Germany, China and the USA). Fundamentally, representatives 
of the highest possible decision-making level are interviewed  
in all the stakeholder groups. In 2021, the Group achieved the  
following results: in Germany, 80% of stakeholders stated they 
trusted the Volkswagen Group (2020: 57%). In China, the propor-
tion was 97% (2020: 92%) and in the USA it was 67% (2020: 78%). 
In Germany, the reputation KPI thus improved by 23% compared 
with 2020. Following its previous high in 2020, the reputation 
KPI in the USA decreased to 67% in 2021. Excluding the above- 
average rise in 2020, the Volkswagen Group’s reputation has been 
on a steadily upward trajectory since 2017. 
STAKEHOLDER PANEL AS A CRITICAL COMPANION
In addition to the Sustainability Council, the Volkswagen Group 
has established a Stakeholder Panel, which has overseen the 
Group sustainability activities for over 20 years. The whole panel 
(Germany/Austria/Switzerland, EU) currently comprises more 
than 200 institutions and organizations.
After interruption of communication with our stakeholders due 
to the pandemic, in the reporting year we started developing a 
long-term stakeholder engagement strategy, which will go into 
concrete implementation in 2022 and synchronize the panel’s 
activities and events with those of the Sustainability Council to a 
greater degree. For 2022, we also plan to establish an international 
panel. 
The reputation KPI has  
improved by 23% 
in Germany 
compared with 2020.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
COMMITMENT TO AN UNDAMAGED ENVIRONMENT
As one of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world, we 
have to observe extensive legal requirements for all sites and 
markets and aim to live up to our internal and external stake-
holders’ high expectations of the effectiveness of environmental 
management – including, and especially following, the diesel is-
sue. We also want to live up to our voluntary commitments on 
environmental matters and compliant behavior. The environ-
mental compliance management system is therefore in particular 
a risk provision against breaches of regulations that may be asso-
ciated with damage to the environment, our Group and society. 
The aim of our environmental management is also to continuously 
improve our environmental performance and reduce our environ-
mental impact.
One of the focuses of the NEW AUTO Group strategy is the Group’s 
ESG performance. In environmental protection (E), decarboniza-
tion and circular economy are the focus issues. These are also 
core elements of the “goTOzero” Group environmental mission 
statement. At the same time, the environmental compatibility of 
our products, services and processes is one of our Group Essen-
tials. With electric drives, digital connectivity and autonomous 
driving, we want to make the car cleaner, more intelligent, quiet-
er and safer. We use our innovative power in order to reduce our 
environmental footprint – over the entire life cycle of our prod-
ucts and mobility solutions. Our innovations are at the same time 
intended to help our customers to be more environmentally 
friendly.
THE “GOTOZERO” MISSION STATEMENT: MINIMIZATION OF 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT
The Volkswagen Group bundles all its measures in environmental 
protection under the “goTOzero” environmental mission state-
ment. This concept sets the agenda for a way of doing business 
that is as environmentally friendly as possible with a footprint 
that is as carbon-neutral as possible. The Volkswagen Group has 
set itself the goal of achieving this by 2050. 
To quote the environmental Group mission statement: “For all 
our products and mobility solutions we aspire to minimize envi-
ronmental impacts along the entire life cycle – from raw  
material extraction to end-of-life – in order to keep ecosystems 
intact and to create positive impacts on society. Compliance with 
environmental regulations, standards and voluntary commit-
ments is a basic prerequisite of our actions.” This Group mission 
statement combines all strategic and compliance-related aspects 
of the Group’s environmental activities and forms the basis for 
linking targets, key performance indicators, programs and  
measures. The mission statement is continuously reviewed and 
its objectives adjusted to new requirements and changes in 
conditions. 
In its “goTOzero” mission statement, the Volkswagen Group con-
centrates on the following four action areas:
• Climate change: Volkswagen is committed to complying with 
the United Nations’ Paris Agreement. The goal is to become a 
company with a carbon-neutral footprint by 2050. As early as 
by 2025, the Group plans to reduce the total life-cycle green-
house gas emissions from passenger cars and light commercial 
vehicles by 30% compared to 2015. In addition, the Group has 
set a decarbonization target confirmed by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi), which envisages a reduction of 30% 
from 2018 to 2030 without offsetting. 
 
 
 Decarbonization 
 
The transition to renewable energies is a key part of the objectives, 
and to this end, the Group aims to actively drive the transition 
towards renewable energies along the entire life cycle. 
• Resources: Volkswagen wants to further improve its resource 
efficiency and promote reuse and recycling approaches in the 
areas of materials, energy and water. By 2025, the Group plans 
to have reduced the production-related environmental impact 
with respect to energy, water, waste and volatile organic com-
pounds by 45% per vehicle compared to 2010.
• Air quality: Volkswagen is also driving e-mobility forward to 
improve local air quality by reducing emissions of nitrogen  
oxides and particulate matter. 
• Environmental compliance: With respect to integrity, 
Volkswagen aims to set an example for a modern, transparent 
and successful business by installing and monitoring effective 
management systems that cover the environmental impact of 
its mobility solutions across all life-cycle phases.
MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IN MATTERS  
OF THE ENVIRONMENT
The Volkswagen Group has created an environmental policy that 
calls on managers and the workforce to implement environmental 
goals with joint responsibility. In its environmental policy,  
the Group commits to protecting the environment, fulfilling 
binding obligations and continuously improving its environ-
mental compliance management system and environmental 
performance. 
We have also implemented a Group policy for the environmental 
compliance management system describing requirements, 
tasks and responsibilities with regard to the environment and 
compliance. This policy provides the framework for implement-
ing environmental compliance management systems across all 
phases of the business and the entire life cycle of vehicles in our 
brands and companies. The policy defines the minimum re-
quirements for operating organizations regarding implementing 
an environmental compliance management system and gives 
them the flexibility to implement this in a manner in line with 
their business activities.
26
S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
In 2019, we internally set ourselves the target that all production 
and development sites in the Group must obtain third-party certi-
fication of environmental management systems in accordance 
with ISO 14001 or the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme 
(EMAS). Because the standards do not, however, answer the question 
of how to avoid misconduct and how to respond appropriately to 
it, the Volkswagen Group has expanded the established environ-
mental management systems to include important compliance 
aspects.
The intention of our environmental compliance management 
systems is to ensure that environmental aspects and obligations 
are taken into account in our business operations. We consider 
disregard of environmental obligations, fraud or misconduct to 
be a serious compliance breach. Whether our actions conform to 
the requirements of our environmental policy and other environ-
ment-related Group specifications is evaluated annually and  
reported to the Group Board of Management, to the respective 
boards of management of the brands and to the managing  
directors of the companies.
The Group Board of Management is the highest internal decision- 
making level for environmental matters. Both the Volkswagen AG 
Board of Management and the boards of management of the 
brands take account not just of economic, but also social and  
environmental aspects when making relevant business decisions. 
The Group-wide management of environmental protection,  
including implementing the resource-efficiency programs and 
monitoring target achievement, is the responsibility of the 
Group Steering Committee for the Environment and Energy. It is 
the highest environmental committee in the Volkswagen Group 
and is responsible for reporting to the Group Board of Manage-
ment or the environmental officer in the Group Board of Manage-
ment. The Group Steering Committee for CO₂ and the Group 
Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance and Exhaust Emissions 
manage important individual aspects for our products – such as 
CO₂ and exhaust emissions. The Group Steering Committee for 
Sustainability is responsible for climate protection.
The Volkswagen Group coordinates the activities of the brands, 
which in turn manage measures in the individual regions. The 
brands and companies are organizationally responsible for 
themselves when it comes to environmental matters. They base 
their own environmental protection activities on the targets, 
guidelines and principles that apply throughout the Group. In  
order to prove that we have achieved our targets, we disclose environ-
mental key performance indicators annually and report transpar-
ently on the progress of the Group’s efforts.
Good progress has been made as regards external certification. In 
2021, 110 of our 120 sites, including the central development 
units were certified in accordance with ISO 14001 or EMAS. In 
terms of employee numbers, this equates to more than 99%. In ad-
dition, 65 production locations have certified their energy man-
agement systems in accordance with ISO 50001. Since 2009, the 
“Integration of Environmental Factors into Product Develop-
ment” model used in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s 
technical development has also been certified to ISO/TR 14062. 
SEAT development is certified in accordance with ISO 14006.
Checking and Complying with Limits
In internal combustion engines, we adhere to national and inter-
national legal norms and limits. For example, the Euro 6d-TEMP 
standard has been obligatory for new registrations in the Europe-
an Union since September 1, 2019. In addition to the use of the 
Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), it 
also requires measurement in accordance with the RDE (= Real 
Driving Emissions) standard. Unlike with WLTP, emissions are 
not measured on a test bench – they are measured in actual road 
traffic. As of January 1, 2021, the Euro 6d standard became obliga-
tory for all new registrations. This is accompanied by a further 
reduction in emission limits under RDE conditions.
In order to comply with the legal requirement within the frame-
work of the Euro 6 standard, our diesel vehicles come with an 
SCR catalytic converter as standard and all new TSI and TSFI  
gasoline engines have a particulate filter.
Group-wide Communication and Networking  
on Environmental Issues
The Volkswagen Group has established the Group Environmental 
Talk as a format of internal communication for employees.  
Several members of the Group Board of Management and the 
spokesperson for the Volkswagen Group’s Sustainability Council, 
Georg Kell, took part in the event in 2021. The focus of the discus-
sion was on the European Green Deal and the Volkswagen Group’s 
potential in the area of circular economy.
Furthermore, the Group held environmental weeks – “goTOzero 
weeks” – in the brands and regions for the first time in the  
reporting year. The aims of the Group-wide campaign were to 
provide information and facilitate employee networking in the 
Volkswagen Group so as to advance environmental protection 
activities across the Group. The focus was on participatory 
events, talks by experts, and many digital workshops and in-
formation programs on the topics of decarbonization, energy, 
environmental compliance, biodiversity, water, waste and  
circular economy.

LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH DETERMINES  
ANALYSIS AND ACTIONS
We consider the environmental impact we cause throughout the 
entire life cycle and at all stages of the value chain. This includes 
the manufacturing process with the associated extraction of raw 
materials, the production of materials, the processes at our sup-
pliers and our own production operations at our sites, the use 
phase with the resulting vehicle emissions and the necessary 
supply of fuel, and ultimately the recycling of the vehicle at the 
end of its life cycle. For detailed, ISO-standardized life cycle as-
sessments (LCAs), we use special LCA software with our own LCA 
database LEAD (Life Cycle Environmental Assessment Database), 
which makes the exchange of harmonized data throughout the 
Group and a standardized basis for calculating our environmen-
tal performance possible. In the next step, we identify hot spots 
in the life cycle and deduce suitable solutions to reduce the envi-
ronmental impact. We call this life cycle engineering. In line with 
our life cycle approach, we involve our suppliers in our efforts to 
minimize our environmental impact early on.
For example, for the life-cycle analysis of the ID.3, in terms of  
impact categories we particularly consider the climate effect. CO₂ 
and all other emissions relevant to the climate are recorded here 
and converted into CO₂ equivalents. Here, Volkswagen AG com-
missioned TÜV NORD CERT Umweltgutachter GmbH as an inde-
pendent external body to carry out the review of our own life  
cycle assessment study in accordance with the applicable standards 
DIN EN ISO 14040 and DIN EN ISO 14044. In accordance with the 
standard, the manufacturing phase starting with raw material 
extraction, the use phase over 200,000 km in the passenger 
transportation WLTP driving cycle and recycling of the Golf 8 
and ID.3 were all used as the framework.
CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
Our targets in the areas of CO₂, energy, water, waste and volatile 
organic compounds – the reduction in environmental impact in 
production (UEP) – were defined within the production strategy 
and include objectives for the Group and its brands. Given their 
high environmental relevance, we focus particularly on energy 
and CO₂.
REDUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  
OF PRODUCTION (UEP)
By 2025, the production-related environmental impact with  
respect to energy, CO₂, water, waste and volatile organic com-
pounds (VOC) ist to be reduced by 45% per vehicle compared  
to 2010. The following charts show the development of these  
figures from 2010 to 2021 (data: 11+1 months).1
• UEP: –29.0% (2020: –32.4%)2
The following five indicators form the UEP KPI:
• Energy requirements per vehicle: –3.5% (2020: –12.4%)
• CO₂ emissions per vehicle: –33.3% (2020: –35.2%) 
• Water consumption per vehicle: –11.6% (2020: –17.1%)
• Waste for disposal per vehicle: –61.6% (2020: –57.3%)³
• VOC emissions per vehicle: –62.0% (2020: –61.7%)
In 2021, the production situation remained strained due to global 
supply bottlenecks and electronic components in addition to the 
challenges caused by the pandemic. Production stops at many 
sites and the resulting reduced production volume in many cases 
led to a rise in specific resource requirements and thus to the 
specific environmental KPIs per vehicle deviating from the 
targets. 
As a result, the successes of the measures and activities to further 
reduce our factories’ adverse environmental impacts that were 
implemented this year are once again not directly reflected in the 
UEP environmental indicators.

ANCHORING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN 
MANUFACTURING: ZERO IMPACT FACTORY
We are planning the production of tomorrow with our one.PRO-
DUCTION Group production strategy. Emissions levels and the 
use of resources at Volkswagen Group locations require particu-
lar attention. The “goTOzero – Zero Impact Factory” program is  
developing specific steps for more sustainable production. It is 
guided by the vision of creating a factory that has no adverse  
environmental impact. We have developed a checklist of currently 
143 environmental criteria to help the sites determine their status 
on the way to becoming a Zero Impact Factory. As well as the  
criteria of climate protection and energy, emissions, water and 
waste, this also includes aspects such as the appearance of the 
factory, commitment to biodiversity, protecting the soil,  
avoidance of business disruptions, functioning environmental 
management, better resource efficiency towards a circular econ-
omy and environmentally neutral mobility management for  
employees and the transportation of goods.
We are working on the following key issues for further 
implementation:
• Setting and achieving ambitious environmental targets 
for production
• Developing a long-term vision for environmental targets 
in production and rolling it out across the Group
• Strengthening employees’ environmental awareness
• Integration of relevant environmental aspects into processes
We will present the Zero Impact Factory Award to recognize par-
ticularly innovative environmental projects and increase awareness 
of the initiative from 2022. For the coming year, the focus will be 
on measures for environmental improvement with measurable 
success in the areas of avoiding plastic and recycling.
Furthermore, we record environmental measures in the IT-supported 
“Massnahmen@web” system, thus encouraging the Group-wide 
exchange of best practices. In the reporting year, 1,544 implemented 
measures relating to the environment and energy were docu-
mented. They are aimed at improving infrastructure and production 
processes for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
COMMITMENT TO BIODIVERSITY
The manufacturing operation of our vehicles impacts biodiversity 
through emissions, land use and transportation – from raw  
material extraction through the use phase to recycling. 
Volkswagen is aware of its responsibility and has been involved 
in protecting and retaining biological diversity through conser-
vation projects since 2007. As a founding member of Initiative 
Biodiversity in Good Company e. V., we have made a commit-
ment to this. In this commitment, we also acknowledge the three 
goals of the international Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) and have defined corresponding action areas to make our 
contribution to achieving these goals in the context of our  
business activities.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Strategy &  
Reporting > Policy
In addition to supporting conservation projects around the 
world, we have set ourselves the target of increasing biodiversity 
at our production sites as well. Steps such as creating wildflower 
meadows, planting trees and shrubs and installing nesting aids 
for bats, birds and insects have already been taken locally. To  
increase biodiversity at the production sites, we have introduced 
a rating tool, which is also integrated in the checklist. The effective-
ness of the biodiversity measures is regularly reviewed through 
the environmental compliance management system. Another 
component of our commitment is raising employees’ awareness 
of the topic of biodiversity by means of information, training 
and involvement in projects.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
Promptly identifying the risks and opportunities associated with 
our business activities and taking a forward-thinking approach to 
managing them is crucial to our Group’s long-term success. A 
foresighted risk management process and effective internal control 
systems are therefore vitally important to us. Not only do we set 
high internal standards, we also insist that all our suppliers along 
our entire value chain comply with these standards.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
A comprehensive risk management system and internal control 
system (RMS/ICS) helps us to handle risks responsibly. It defines 
the primary principles and elements of our Group, forming the 
basis for the appropriate and effective management and control 
of material risks. This applies to risks with consequences for the 
Volkswagen Group and/or for the environment and society. It is 
thus also directly applicable to the assessment of nonfinancial 
risks that could arise when pursuing goals and implementing 
measures in the focus areas.
 
 ESG Performance Management and Materiality Analysis
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Orga-
nizations of the Treadway Commission). Through a Group risk 
management policy, all business divisions and units are obliged to 
implement an RMS/ICS. The Board of Management receives ad-hoc 
and quarterly risk reports. 
The focus of our RMS/ICS is the three lines model – a basic element 
required by, among others, the European Confederation of Institutes 
of Internal Auditing (ECIIA). In line with this model, our RMS/ICS 
has three lines that are designed to protect us from the occurrence 
of material risks. 
The first line comprises the operational risk management and 
internal control systems of the individual brands, companies 
and departments. The RMS/ICS is an integral part of the 
Volkswagen Group’s structure and workflows. Incidents that 
could constitute a risk are identified and assessed in the first 
line. Countermeasures are introduced, the residual potential im-
pact is assessed, and the information is incorporated into plan-
ning in a timely manner. Material risks are reported to the rele-
vant committees on an ad-hoc basis. The results of the 
operational risk management process are incorporated into bud-
get planning and financial control on an ongoing basis. The tar-
gets agreed in the budget planning rounds are continually re-
viewed in revolving planning updates. At the same time, the 
results of risk mitigation measures are promptly incorporated 
into the monthly forecasts regarding further business develop-
ment. This means that the Board of Management also has access 
to an overall picture of the current risk situation via the docu-
mented reporting channels during the year.
The second line is the Group risk management organization, 
which, among other things, sets standards for the RMS/ICS, pro-
vides support to the divisions in the form of relevant training 
and coordinates the quarterly risk survey. It reports quarterly to 
the Group Board of Management on any material risks, which 
are defined using quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria 
and given probability ratings. The additional annual governance, 
risk and compliance (GRC) control process, with a focus on inter-
nal control activities, is being gradually replaced by a standard 
ICS. In the standard ICS, standardized control targets are now set 
for the key brands, companies and departments to cover process 
risks. The documented control activities are regularly tested for 
their effectiveness and the ICS is thus improved.
The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit, which carries 
out regular checks on the structure and implementation of the 
RMS and ICS as part of its independent audit activities. 
The Volkswagen Group continuously develops its risk manage-
ment in order to take account of constantly increasing internal 
and external requirements in the field of corporate 
responsibility. 
RISKS CONCERNING NONFINANCIAL ISSUES
Nonfinancial matters are taken into account in both the method-
ology and the content of our RMS/ICS. The standard ICS uses 
master control catalogs containing standardized process risks 
and associated control targets as a specification for internal  
controls to be carried out in the brands and companies. Risks 
and requirements in relation to product or environmental com-
pliance are addressed in various master control catalogs – e.g. for 
production. To ensure the appropriateness of the master control 
catalog , we check whether it is up to date each year, and it is ad-
justed if necessary. In the quarterly risk process, the risks are 
classified into risk clusters. 
The nonfinancial matters pursuant to the German CSR Directive 
Implementation Act (CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz – CSR-
RUG) are addressed in both the master control catalogs in the 
standard ICS and the risk clusters of the quarterly risk process. 
For example, environmental matters are taken into account in 
the Environment and Sustainability master control catalog via 
the risk that “the material environmental and sustainability 
risks of our products, production and services along the entire 
life cycle are not/insufficiently identified”. In the compliance 
master control catalog, the risk that “compliance breaches and 
risks (whistleblower information) are not addressed or not suf-
ficiently addressed or not promptly/correctly dealt with” serves 
to address the matter of “combating corruption and bribery”. As 
part of the quarterly risk process, risk clusters involving environ-
mental risks, emission risks, compliance risks or CO₂ risks or 
32
S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  I N  T H E  G R O U P ’ S  D N A
product-related risks, for example, that address these matters are 
specified in this process.
Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general 
environmental risks and climate-change risks. These include 
risks that could result from different CO₂ and emissions regula-
tions, but also extreme weather, storms or floods with effects on 
production, infrastructure and supply chains. The risks relevant 
from the Volkswagen Group’s perspective are presented in the  
report on risks and opportunities in the management report. In 
fiscal year 2021, risks continued to be identified with regard to 
compliance with regulations on fleet CO₂ emissions in individual 
brands and markets. A more detailed description is available in 
the report on risks and opportunities in the Annual Report under 
the heading “Environmental Protection Regulations”. Further 
risks arise from the assertion of what are actually civil-law environ-
mental policy objectives.
The Volkswagen Group generates significant negative effects 
with regard to the environment with its business and products 
due to CO₂ emissions across the entire life cycle. We wish to  
make our contribution to limiting global warming to well below  
two degrees Celsius in accordance with the Paris Agreement by 
making our entire Group net carbon neutral by 2050. To this end, 
decarbonization has been firmly anchored as a focus issue in the 
NEW AUTO Group strategy. More information on the effects, tar-
gets and measures can be found in the “Decarbonization” chapter.  
 
 
 Decarbonization
Beyond this, no further risks with very likely serious negative  
effects have been identified.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a good corporate citizen, we would like to be a constant eco-
nomic driver and contribute to structural development and 
equal opportunities in more (business) processes. We have  
always believed in the importance of recognizing our social  
responsibilities towards our stakeholders. We do not yet have  
a Corporate Citizenship strategy that applies throughout the 
Group, but we regard it as a must for reasons of transparency and 
accountability. That is why we are currently working on a strategic 
foundation for this action area. The main focus of our philan-
thropic activities is on supporting future, environmental, edu-
cational and community projects at many of our sites across the 
world.
We select specific projects and develop them on our own or in 
partnership with local partner organizations and NGOs.
•  The projects are in line with the Group Essentials and address  
a specific issue of local relevance or a global challenge.
•  They are an expression of diversity within the Group and the  
social environment in which the projects are carried out.
•  They are the result of close dialog with the local stakeholders  
involved in implementation.
•  Projects are managed locally under the responsibility of the  
competent units.
In the reporting year, the development of Group-wide corporate  
citizenship guidelines was accelerated, and their adoption and the 
start of the rollout is planned for 2022. 
EUROPEAN IMPACT HERO SUPPORTS 
SUSTAINABLE START-UPS
Together with SAP and Microsoft Germany, Volkswagen and Audi 
supported a Europe-wide program for supporting social entre-
preneurs oriented towards sustainability. The European Impact 
Hero program supports start-ups from the fields of circular econ-
omy, climate and sustainability in the supply chain with  
expertise from volunteers from the four large corporations, 
valuable contacts and prize money – donated by Ecopreneur.eu,  
a European network of sustainable businesses. 
European Impact Hero was embedded in the European Social 
Economy Summit (EUSES) jointly organized by the European 
Commission and the City of Mannheim. The conference is orga-
nized by the European Commission every six years with the aim 
of strengthening the social economy in Europe and spelling out 
its contribution to economic development, social inclusion and 
environmental transformation. 
In May 2021, in conjunction with Impact Hero Day, ten start-ups 
qualified for the Impact Hero Lab following an intensive application 
phase, selection by jury and presentation of innovative solutions 
to problems, and thus for high-quality support to enhance their 
business models in a six-month accelerated program. 
In the Impact Hero Lab, the start-ups will be supported by various 
experts and mentors. At the closing event in November 2021, the 
companies supported presented their models to impact investors 
and the reporting companies. The start-up that made the most 
progress in the Biodiversity & Ecosystem Futures (BEF) program 
won the European Impact Hero Award and prize money of 
€ 5,000.
PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT 
FOR DIGITAL EDUCATION
The Volkswagen Group increasingly links sustainability with 
digitalization in its social engagement activities, relying on  
partnerships to do so. As part of a long-term collaboration with 
Microsoft Germany, one of our focuses is on projects in digital 
education and training. This is intended to give people access to 
digital technology, thus increasing participation in society and 
future opportunities.
At the Autostadt Wolfsburg, the two cooperation partners also 
expanded the digital training options in the reporting year. 
These training options are aimed at school students, young  
people, adults and teachers. The new format included a weekly 
live stream learning option (“Mittwochs um 4 lernen wir” [We 
learn on Wednesday at 4]). Extensive knowledge from the topics 
of programming, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, 
technology and design was playfully and entertainingly presented 
on a dedicated YouTube channel.
EXTENSIVE PHILANTHROPIC CONTRIBUTIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD
During the reporting year, we were sustainably active in the 
fields of the environment and society through numerous projects 
worldwide. We give donations in cash and in kind to support  
activities and projects primarily devoted to education, culture, 
sports and social causes. Donations may only be given to recog-
nized non-profit organizations or ones specifically endorsed to 
receive donations. 
The Volkswagen Group donated €1 million in emergency aid in 
the areas affected by flooding in North Rhine Westphalia and 
Rhineland Palatinate in Germany in 2021. The funds were given 
to the German Red Cross, which organized the aid locally with 
around 3,500 emergency personnel. The funds provided by the 
Volkswagen Group were used to directly support the people in 
need and were used to distribute aid supplies and medical emer-
gency aid. In addition, they funded equipment and supplies for

the numerous German Red Cross helpers. Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche 
AG also provided donations of € 1 million for flood victims in 
“Aktion Deutschland Hilft”, plus a donation of € 500,000 for the 
German Red Cross’s international flood assistance in Belgium, 
Austria and the Netherlands. AUDI AG employees donated more 
than € 400,000 for the benefit of flood victims, and AUDI AG 
topped this sum up to € 800,000 following a decision by the 
Board of Management.
In the reporting period, Volkswagen AG made donations 
amounting to € 31.2 million. 
In 2021, the brands and companies supported more than 800 
projects and initiatives around the world.

PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION 
Climate change is one of humanity’s key challenges. The speed of 
global warming has rapidly increased in the last three decades. 
Stopping it is a challenge for us all. According to the calculations of 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the trans-
port sector accounts for around a fifth of global greenhouse gas 
emissions. As one of the world’s largest automotive manufacturers 
and mobility providers, we are aware of our responsibility and have 
defined the decarbonization of our Group and its products as a fo-
cus area and therefore a key element of our corporate strategy. 
We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims 
to keep the increase in global temperature by 2050 to well below 
two degrees Celsius. By 2050, we want our whole Group to become 
net carbon neutral. We have set important milestones and inter-
mediate goals for ourselves along the way: by 2030, we want to 
reduce the CO₂ emissions of our passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles by 30% per vehicle over their entire life cycles, 
compared with the base year of 2018. Alongside the Group’s electric 
offensive, we are focusing to a greater extent on integrating re-
newably generated electricity in the use phase and switching our 
production plants’ external power supply to renewable energy. 
Decarbonization occupies a key position in the NEW AUTO Group 
strategy and is one of six focus topics in the Group initiative to 
improve ESG performance. The commitment to climate protec-
tion is also a core part of our “goTOzero” environmental mission 
statement, which stands for a net carbon-neutral way of doing 
business.
Reporting According to TCFD Recommendations
For the first time, we are reporting our activities on climate pro-
tection in detail in accordance with the guidelines of the Task 
Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was 
set up by the G20’s Financial Stability Board. These guidelines cre-
ate a coherent framework for voluntary and consistent reporting 
of an entity’s climate-related financial risks and opportunities. 
This chapter on decarbonization is structured accordingly.
CLIMATE PROTECTION CENTRALLY MANAGED 
The Group Board of Management is the Group’s highest sustain-
ability body. The Chairman of the Board of Management has 
cross-functional overall responsibility for sustainability. The 
Group Steering Committee for Sustainability bears the main  
responsibility for climate protection along the value chain as  
the highest body below the Board of Management. Product and 
portfolio topics are managed by the Group Steering Committee 
for CO₂. 
At least twice a year, the Group Steering Committee for Sustain-
ability reports information about corporate-responsibility and 
sustainability topics – e.g. about handling the risks and opportu-
nities of climate change – and the Group Steering Committee for 
CO₂ reports information about product-related greenhouse gas 
emissions to the Group Board of Management, which makes key 
decisions on topics relevant to climate protection. For example, 
the Group plans to invest around € 89 billion in cutting-edge  
areas such as hybridization, electric mobility and digitalization 
by 2026. This equates to around 55% of capital expenditure and 
all the Group’s research and development costs in the planning  
period. € 52 billion alone is earmarked for investment in electric 
mobility.
The Group Board of Management is also the highest internal  
decision-making level for environmental issues. The relevant 
Group steering committees, such as the Group Steering Committee 
for Sustainability or for the Environment and Energy, are respon-
sible for managing environmental protection issues throughout 
the Group. Other bodies oversee important individual aspects 
for our products – for example CO₂ and exhaust emissions. These 
include the Group Steering Committee for CO₂ and the Group 
Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance and Exhaust Emis-
sions. They report to the Board of Management on various top-
ics: the implementation of the NEW AUTO Group strategy, the  
decarbonization program, risk management, business plans,  
setting and pursuing targets, and requirements for handling  
climate-related topics. For Volkswagen, climate-related topics 
have an important strategic and operative significance – e.g. 
with respect to regulatory requirements and the corresponding 
performance of our products and also our Group’s ongoing 
transformation process. In addition to having Group-wide  
responsibility for sustainability, the Board of Management regular-
ly consults with Volkswagen’s Sustainability Council on climate 
protection. 
Remuneration of the Board of Management Linked to 
Decarbonization Progress
The Volkswagen Group has linked the remuneration of the  
members of its Board of Management to, among other things, 
the development of the decarbonization index as the core  
climate-protection-related key indicator in the Group. This serves 
as a measurement tool for the CO₂ emissions of the brands of the 
EU-27, China and US regions that manufacture passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles over the entire life cycle. The 
Volkswagen Group’s Remuneration Report provides further  
information on how key sustainability criteria are taken into  
account in the Board of Management’s remuneration.

MANAGEMENT OF GROUP-WIDE CLIMATE PROTECTION 
MEASURES 
The Group Board of Management member responsible for pro-
duction regularly informs the Group Board of Management on 
sustainability, environmental and energy-related topics. The 
member of the Board of Management is responsible for all  
production and environmental activities, including activities 
connected with climate-friendly mobility. The Group-wide manage-
ment of environmental protection is the responsibility of the 
member of the Board of Management responsible for production 
and of the Group Steering Committee for the Environment and 
Energy, which is supported by numerous specialist bodies. 
Climate-related topics are coordinated and managed by regular 
meetings of the Group steering committees, by internal and  
external stakeholder engagement and by continuous communi-
cation with the heads of the Group’s and the brands’ various  
research and development units and other Group functions.
Volkswagen’s Group Head of Environment provides reports to 
the Group Board of Management on environment- and energy- 
related topics in their capacity as Head of the Group Steering  
Committee for the Environment and Energy. The Division Head 
of the Group Strategy and General Secretariat provides reports to 
the Chairman of the Group Board of Management in their capacity 
as Head of the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability and 
regularly informs the Group Board of Management on sustain-
ability- and environment-related topics. The positions described 
have the task of coordinating and managing the sustainability,  
environmental and CO₂ activities decided by the Group Board of 
Management. 
The Volkswagen Group’s Climate-Related  
Risk and Opportunity Analysis
The Group identifies both risks resulting from climate change 
(physical risks) and risks and opportunities due to the shift toward a 
decarbonized economy (transitional risks and opportunities).
I. Transitional risks
 a.  Politics & law 
 
Emissions standards 
Compliance with fleet and exhaust-emission limits can be 
technically challenging and require significant investment. 
Breaches of limits may also result in significant financial 
penalties. The Volkswagen Group closely coordinates  
technology and product planning with its brands so as to 
implement existing legal requirements and avoid breaches 
of limits. 
 
Carbon pricing 
Volkswagen supports ambitious carbon pricing, as this  
promotes the transformation to climate-friendly electric 
mobility in line with Group strategy. An increasingly effective 
carbon price, particularly in Europe, may, however, also lead 
to additional costs in energy and material consumption.  
The Group is countering this risk by switching its energy 
supply to renewable energies in the long term and integrating 
corresponding quotas for the use of renewably generated 
electricity in supplier-side procurement requirements. 
 
Additional costs or earnings losses may result from a man-
datory tightening of emission reduction targets or early  
divestitures of the Group portfolio’s high-emission products. 
The Group counters this risk through certification of the 
conformity of its self-imposed decarbonization targets in  
accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement by independent 
and internationally recognized organizations such as the 
Science Based Targets initiative. 
 b.  Technology 
 
Increasing model diversity 
The increasing diversity of models as part of the electric of-
fensive and shorter product life cycles come with a global in-
crease in vehicle start-ups. The technical systems and pro-
cesses involved are complex, which means there is a risk that 
vehicle start-ups may be delayed. The Group counters this 
risk by identifying weak points in product creation early and 
on the basis of experience, with the aim of protecting vehicle 
start-ups in respect of quantity, quality and timing.
 c.  Market 
 
Emission-based vehicle taxation 
Potential increases in vehicle taxes based on CO₂ emissions – 
as is already the case in many European countries – may lead 
to demand shifting in favor of smaller segments and engines 
and have an adverse financial impact for the Group. The 
Group counters this risk by constantly developing new and 
fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative drive technologies. 
The electrification of the portfolio and the Group’s drive and 
fuel strategy form the basis for this.
 d.  Reputation 
 
Reporting & communication 
Critical media reports or defensive communication by the 
Group in relation to its CO₂ emissions, reduction targets and 
the decarbonization strategy might lead to reputational 
damage and, as a consequence, to reductions in the demand 
for the Group’s products. The Group counters the risk through 
regular communication regarding its carbon footprint, emis-
sion reduction targets, and electrification and decarboniza-
tion strategy in the annual and sustainability reports and in 
its stakeholder management.

II. Physical risks
 a.  Acute 
 
Extreme weather events 
Potential disruptions of the supply of critical input factors, 
such as semiconductors, caused by the impact of weather 
events such as floods or winter storms may potentially lead 
to production downtime that has a financial impact for the 
Group. The Group counters the supply risk with strategic al-
location of quantities available to the brands, prioritization 
of components and the intensification of business relation-
ship management with suppliers.
 b.  Chronic 
 
Water availability 
If the climate impacts water availability, this can lead to a 
need for site-related investments or cause added costs as  
a result of any adjustment measures needed or alternative 
supply routes. The Group counters this risk by assessing the 
climate-related vulnerability of production sites and deriving 
appropriate countermeasures using environmental analyses.
III. Opportunities
 a.  Products 
 
Sales potential 
The transformation of transportation and the associated 
transition to lower-emission and electric mobility open up 
new sales potential for fuel-efficient vehicles, electric vehicles 
and other alternative drives. The Volkswagen Group is laying 
the groundwork to open up the sales potential of the trans-
formation of transportation with its brands based on coordi-
nated technology and product planning and the associated 
electric offensive.
 b.  Efficiency 
 
Cost savings 
Decarbonization measures can go hand in hand with tapping 
efficiency potential. These include, for example, measures for 
more efficient LED lighting, modernized heat supply and 
cooling at the sites or also optimized washing and drying 
processes in production. The Group identifies and taps such 
potential by systematically recording and assessing reduction 
measures to be implemented on the basis of various decision- 
making criteria as part of the decarbonization program.  
Furthermore, the Group has a tool that provides additional 
incentives for implementing efficiency measures in the form 
of its CO₂ fund. 
 c.  Market 
 
Capital market performance 
A positive performance on CO₂ and reporting in line with  
capital market requirements may positively impact rating 
outcomes and the Group’s capital market conditions. ESG  
criteria are therefore an integral component of the NEW AUTO 
Group strategy with the aim of achieving sustainable im-
provements in capital market performance. Furthermore, 
the Group is gearing its reporting even more systematically 
to capital market requirements (e.g. TCFD). Volkswagen  
published its first Green Finance Report during the reporting 
year. The Green Finance Framework systematically links our 
corporate objective of CO₂ neutrality by 2050 with our financing 
strategy. 
 
 Sustainability Management
Scenario Analysis as a Decision-Making Basis  
for Climate Protection
Volkswagen is a member of the Mobility Multiple (MoMo) work-
ing group of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Group 
helped develop the model itself and uses model data and as-
sumptions in a variety of contexts. MoMo uses various IEA ETP 
(Energy Technology Perspectives) scenarios, including 2DS (2 °C 
Scenario) and B2DS (Beyond 2 °C Scenario). We have focused on 
the target years 2025 and 2030 here. These describe the mile-
stones on the way to net carbon neutrality by 2050. We have con-
ducted analyses up to 2050, as this was the maximum timeframe 
covered by the model. We have therefore concentrated the inves-
tigations on the relevant reference years of 2025 and 2030, as 
these represent reference years for internal KPIs.
The scenario analysis focused on the areas of production, sales 
and technology, the impact of products, and materials procure-
ment. In respect of production-related emissions, the analysis 
showed that a significant reduction in emission intensity per  
vehicle will be needed to achieve the UN climate goals, particularly 
in view of increasing unit sales. With respect to the development 
of the vehicle sector, the analysis showed that electrification is  
going to grow considerably in importance; internal combustion 
engines will, however, retain a substantial market share in the 
next decade, even in a B2DS scenario. These results are necessary 
to make a well-founded decision regarding our sales planning 
and materials production. They are integrated into our decar-
bonization index scenarios to assess the reduction per vehicle 
over the entire life cycle. The market- and product-related results 
support and affirm our decision confirmed by the NEW AUTO 
Group strategy to invest massively in electric mobility and in  
increasing the efficiency of the internal combustion powertrain.

DECARBONIZATION PROGRAM TARGETS 
WHOLE LIFE CYCLE
In order to achieve its targets, the Volkswagen Group is imple-
menting a comprehensive and holistic decarbonization program 
that covers the whole life cycle of the vehicles. It is built on three 
key principles, which at the same time represent a setting of pri-
orities: the top priority is measures with which CO₂ emissions 
can be avoided or reduced. In second place follow measures with 
which we can gradually shift the energy supply in the entire val-
ue chain to renewable energy. Finally, we offset unavoidable CO₂ 
emissions through climate protection projects that meet the 
high international standards. 
The electrification of our vehicle fleet and the associated cut in 
CO₂ emissions in the use phase mean that the relevance of the 
supply chain in the decarbonization of the Volkswagen Group is 
continuously increasing. The Volkswagen Group therefore syste m-
atically identifies the biggest drivers of CO₂ emissions in the  
supply chain and defines measures to reduce them.
One identified focus here is steel. The Volkswagen Group is there-
fore in close communication with selected steel manufacturers in 
order to accelerate the switch to carbon-neutral products. For ex-
ample, the Group subsidiary Scania has entered into a coopera-
tion with the start-up H2 Green Steel. For the ID. models, for  
example, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand is going to use  
additional sustainable components this year, including battery 
cases and wheel rims made of green aluminum and tires pro-
duced with low emissions. The ID. family’s carbon footprint can 
be improved by around two metric tons per vehicle in the next 
few years through ten focus components. For new vehicle proj-
ects, Volkswagen wants to make CO₂ emissions a key contract- 
award criterion for relevant supplier contracts in the future. 
We are tackling the challenge that higher CO₂ emissions initially 
arise in the supply chain during the transition to electric mobili-
ty and shares of the use phase are shifting to production. This is 
because of the difficulty of raw material extraction and the ener-
gy-intensive processes in manufacturing batteries, which are al-
so used in our supply chain. All suppliers (new contract awards) 
of high-voltage batteries are already contractually obliged to use 
certified power from renewable sources in their production pro-
cesses. This stipulation was expanded to include additional re-
quirements in relevant lower levels of the value chain and has 
been integrated into our contract awards during the reporting 
year. CO₂ emissions in battery manufacturing are therefore 
falling.
More information on decarbonization measures in the upstream 
levels of the value chain can be found in the “Responsibility for 
supply chains and business” chapter.
On the key topic of battery cells, we want to take a pioneering 
role in Germany and worldwide and are making targeted invest-
ments in our own production capacity to this end. For example, 
Volkswagen Group Components has significantly expanded the 
production of battery systems for the latest generation of e-vehicles 
at its Braunschweig plant. Following the first stage of expansion 
with the maximum capacity of 250,000 battery systems, the sec-
ond expansion stage with the same capacity started in 2021. In 
total, the site will now be able to install up to 500,000 batteries 
for models based on the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) 
each year following complete ramp-up. In addition, Volkswagen 
Group China started construction of a production plant for bat-
tery systems in Hefei (Anhui Province) in the reporting year. 
The plant will initially supply between 150,000 and 180,000 high- 
voltage battery systems for Volkswagen Anhui’s all electric  
vehicles based on the Group’s MAB platform.
Volkswagen Group Components opened a modern laboratory for 
cell research and development in Europe in 2021, located in 
Salzgitter. The new unified battery cell for the volume segment 
will roll off the production line at the gigafactory in Salzgitter 
from 2025. By 2030, the Volkswagen Group wants to operate six 
cell factories with a production output of 240 GWh in Europe to-
gether with partners and in this way guarantee supply security.
Volkswagen also owns a stake in Swedish battery company 
Northvolt AB, which is going to build a factory for the production 
of lithium ion batteries that should start production in 2024. We 
supported our partner with US$ 620 million in a financing round 
to expand capacity in the areas of production, recycling, and re-
search and development in the Northvolt Ett gigafactory in Skel-
lefteå in northern Sweden.
E-mobility as a Key Factor of Decarbonization
Compared to vehicles with an internal combustion engine, electric 
vehicles have less of an impact on the environment, as they pro-
duce no local emissions during use. Our calculations show that 
the current carbon footprint of electric vehicles is already better 
on average in Europe in most markets than comparable gasoline 
or diesel vehicles over the entire life cycle as well.
The consistent electrification of our vehicle fleet opens up the 
path to sustainable, emission-neutral mobility for our custom-
ers. We plan to invest around € 52 billion in electric mobility 
across the Group by 2026. Electric vehicles’ share in sales in our 
core markets of the EU, the US and China should rise to more 
than 50% by 2030. In the EU alone, the Group wants to achieve a 
share of sales of least 60% at this time and for the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars brand 70%. As a result, the Group would substan-
tially exceed EU Green Deal targets aimed at tightening fleet 
emission threshold values. The new electric vehicles are manu-
factured at eight sites in Europe, China and the US. The modular 
electric drive matrix (MEB) serves as the technical backbone of 
the e-offensive and is used in many more of our electric models. 
We saw the market launch of additional e-models from different 
brands in 2021, including the Volkswagen ID.4, Volkswagen ID.6 
(China), ŠKODA ENYAQ iV, Audi Q4 e-tron, Audi Q4 Sportback 
e-tron, Audi e-tron GT and Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo.

Renewable Energy for Vehicle Use
Around 75% of a car’s CO₂ emissions arise in the use phase (“well 
to tank” and “tank to wheel”). A key factor in achieving car-
bon-neutral e-mobility is consistently charging vehicles with 
100 % renewably generated electricity. This is the only way that 
almost half of all CO₂ emissions can be avoided compared with 
the normal EU electricity mix.
By supplying energy from renewable sources via our subsidiary 
Elli (Electric Life), we can offer our customers the option of being 
emission-free in the use phase too. Volkswagen Naturstrom, 
which is almost 100% carbon neutral, is generated by wind, solar 
and hydroelectric power plants in Germany, Austria and  
Switzerland. In order to set up fast charging infrastructure, 
Volkswagen founded the joint venture IONITY with other OEMs. 
IONITY had set up 400 fast charging stations on major highways 
across Europe by 2020. Along with its partners, the Group wants 
to operate around 18,000 public fast charging points in Europe 
by 2025. This represents a fivefold expansion of the fast charging 
network compared to today and corresponds to about one third 
of the total demand predicted for 2025 on the continent. 
This will be achieved through a series of strategic partnerships in 
addition to IONITY. For example, BP wants to construct around 
8,000 fast charging points across Europe together with Volkswagen. 
In cooperation with Iberdrola, Volkswagen will, in particular,  
cover main traffic routes in Spain. In Italy, Volkswagen wants to 
collaborate with Enel to expand the fast charging network both 
along freeways and in urban areas. Volkswagen wants to spend 
about € 400 million for the European program as a whole by 2025. 
Volkswagen wants to expand the public fast charging network in 
the US and China too. Electrify America is planning around 3,500 
fast charging points in North America by the end of the reporting 
year. In China, Volkswagen is planning a total of 17,000 fast 
charging points by 2025 through the CAMS joint venture.
Volkswagen supports the construction 
of wind farms and solar parks  
In addition, the Volkswagen Group is the first car maker to directly 
support the expansion of renewable energy on an industrial 
scale in the future. New wind farms and solar parks are to be 
constructed in several regions of Europe by 2025. Contracts for 
the first projects were already signed with energy company RWE 
in the reporting year. In Germany, Volkswagen supported the 
construction of a solar plant with a total capacity of 170 million 
kWh each year. This was completed in Tramm-Göthen in Meck-
lenburg in northeastern Germany by the end of 2021 and was 
constructed entirely without any state subsidies. Incorporating 
around 420,000 solar modules, it is the largest independent solar 
project in Germany. It is planned that all projects together will 
generate around 7 terawatt hours (TWh) of additional green  
electricity by 2025. This should even better cover the electricity 
needs of the electric vehicles brought to market and mean a net 
carbon neutral use phase can be achieved for the electric fleet. In 
addition, in the reporting year, the supply of around 1 TWh was 
contractually agreed through entering into partnerships with 
electricity suppliers.
E-cars will be part of energy systems in the future 
Volkswagen will integrate the electric car in private, commercial 
and public energy systems in the future. This will allow green 
electricity from the solar plant to be stored in the vehicle and fed 
back into the home network if needed. Not only will customers 
be more independent of the public power grid, they will also save 
money and reduce CO₂ emissions. Models based on Volkswagen’s 
own MEB platform will support this technology from 2022 on-
wards. Volkswagen also plans to offer a complete package with 
all technical modules and digital services for bi directional 
charging. The technology is soon to be used on a larger scale – 
for example in residential buildings, businesses or in the general 
power grid.
Climate Protection in Manufacturing
Since 2010, Volkswagen has increased vehicle production from 
7.3 million to 8.0 million vehicles (an increase of 10%). Although 
absolute energy consumption increased by 6%, at the same time 
absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 27%. Volkswagen 
wants to continue this trend and reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions in production by 50.4% in absolute terms compared to 2018 
by 2030, which corresponds to a 1.5 °C trajectory. By 2021, abso-
lute greenhouse gas emissions had already been decreased by 
20.7%. Key to this are increasing energy efficiency and switching 
to a renewable power supply as important components of the de-
carbonization strategy. Nine production sites are already  
operated on a carbon-neutral basis, including compensation 
measures: Brussels and Győr (Audi), Zwickau and Dresden 
(Volkswagen), Zuffenhausen and Leipzig (Porsche), Crewe (Bent-
ley Motors), Vrchlabí (ŠKODA) and Santa Agata (Lamborghini).
The Volkswagen Group has made progress in supplying its plants 
with electricity from renewable energies since 2019. The percentage 
of electricity purchased externally rose from 95 to 96% at EU 
production sites within one year. By 2023, all EU sites are to be 
supplied with 100% electricity from renewable sources. By 2030, 
the same target is planned for all global sites outside China.
A total of 43 production sites within the EU and ten additional sites 
outside the EU were fully converted to an external electricity 
supply generated from renewable energies. This meant that 
100% renewably generated electricity was used at 53 Group sites 
in 2021.
In 2021, 49% of the Group’s total global electricity consumption 
(including China) at its production sites was accounted for by  
renewable electricity – an increase of 9% compared with the  
previous year. The Volkswagen Group is currently working with 
its Chinese partners to develop its own targets for its Chinese  
production sites. The high proportion of coal-fired power in the  
Chinese electricity mix and the highly regulated electricity  
market make this project particularly challenging.

T C F D  |  St ra te g y  
Volkswagen is also paying particular attention to converting its 
own electricity generation. The conversion of the power plants in 
Wolfsburg from coal to gas, which commenced in 2019, is expect-
ed to reduce operational emissions by 60% from 2023 onwards, 
which equates to annual savings of 1.5 million metric tons  
of CO₂.
In 2021, greenhouse gas emissions by the Group decreased by 
20,000 metric tons CO₂ compared with the previous year. The in-
creased percentage of renewable energies used to supply  
production sites played a key role in achieving this decrease. 
In addition, Volkswagen is working at full speed on advancing 
energy-efficiency projects in its 120 production facilities. Across 
the Group, 1,544 measures for saving energy were implemented 
in 2021 alone. 
GOTOZERO IMPACT LOGISTICS
In order to achieve the climate targets and contribute to the  
decarbonization of the Group, Volkswagen Group Logistics is 
working together with colleagues from Brand Logistics in the  
goTOzero Impact Logistics initiative. Continuous optimization  
of the transport network and logistics processes can reduce  
emissions. In addition, the use of new, low-emission technologies  
in the transportation of production materials and finished  
vehicles is being reviewed and pushed. 
The measures the Volkswagen Group has taken to achieve carbon- 
neutral logistics going forward include moving shipments from 
road to rail and the complete avoidance of CO₂ through the use 
of green electricity on electric railroad lines in Germany in col-
laboration with Deutsche Bahn AG.
Volkswagen is one of the first carmakers to transport most of its 
new vehicles on the North Atlantic using low-emission LNG ships 
(LNG – liquefied natural gas). After the first two LNG car carriers 
entered service in 2020, Volkswagen Group Logistics is going to 
use four more ships with dual fuel engines that can be powered 
with liquid gas from the end of 2023 and run using  
renewably generated fuels in the future. By using liquid gas, 
Volkswagen aims to reduce the ships’ CO₂ emissions. In Europe-
an ship transportation, the Group already operates two car carri-
ers with biofuel produced from plant-based waste material – 
such as waste oil from the food industry.
Volkswagen also plans to tap potential for cutting emissions in 
internal mobility processes in the future. For example, for  
planning and organizing business travel by air and rail, a carbon 
calculator is to be trialed for the Board of Management and top 
management in a pilot project. 
CO₂ Fund Funds Decarbonization of the Group’s Own Processes
The Volkswagen Group has an internal CO₂ fund that proportion-
ally funds projects around the world that make a contribution to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are transferable to as 
many sites, brands and companies as possible. Up to € 25 million 
per year is available for this. At the end of the 2021 reporting year,  
a number of successful projects were completed. These included 
measures for decarbonizing the sales network as part of the Sus-
tainability@Retail initiative. In other areas of business, projects 
range from the construction of a biogas plant for the ŠKODA 
brand in India to supporting technologies to increase the  
proportion of recycled plastics for vehicle components. New 
projects have already been decided for 2022 as well. 
Carbon-Neutral Handover of Electric Vehicles 
For a number of the Group’s electric vehicles, Volkswagen has  
decided to make their handover to customers net carbon neutral. 
For as long as we cannot avoid CO₂ emissions and cannot use  
renewable energies everywhere, we will do this by voluntarily 
offsetting the remaining greenhouse gas emissions from the 
supply chain, production and logistics of MEB vehicles from the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, 
SEAT and ŠKODA brands in Europe and of selected vehicle types 
from the Porsche and Audi brands based on the PPE platform 
(Premium Platform Electric). We expect electrification and the 
associated net carbon-neutral delivery in Europe to increase the 
need for offsetting for the next years, which totaled 6.1 million 
metric tons of CO₂ for the Group (excluding China) in 2021.
Offset projects in line with high international standards 
We offset unavoidable emissions from the life cycle phases, such 
as from the supply chain, production, etc., through climate pro-
tection projects with high certification standards, such as the 
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) in combination with the Climate 
Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB) or the Gold Standard. 
For the quality assurance of offsetting projects, we assess the 
projects with regard to compliance with standards, credibility, 
site selection, project size and the contribution to achieving the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. To underpin our 
commitment to climate protection projects and be able to develop 
our own projects in accordance with the highest standards, we 
established a joint venture for offset projects during the report-
ing year.
Use of technical carbon sinks and carbon removal 
from the atmosphere 
We recognize the need to tap additional potential by creating 
technical carbon sinks and associated projects for carbon dioxide 
removal to achieve the decarbonization goals. And we are run-
ning our own research projects to this end. Among other things, 
Volkswagen Group Innovation’s “Climate Engineering” technology 
building bundles all the Group’s initiatives on carbon dioxide  
removal approaches to leverage synergies for all the brands, the 
entire Group and our customers. One key focus is activities for 
evaluating direct-air-capture technologies and their industrial-
ization to establish broad access to affordable negative emissions 
for industry and society in the short to medium term. For the  
acceleration of previous efforts on the way to decarbonization, 
the Group has signed a memorandum of understanding for the 
development of relevant projects to permanently remove CO₂

from the atmosphere with its Icelandic project partner Carbfix, 
which turns CO₂ into natural stone through mineralization in a 
certified process.
European Commitment in the CEO Alliance
The Chairman of the Board of Management of the Volkswagen 
Group, together with the CEOs of ten further companies with 
their registered offices in Europe, expressly acknowledged the 
EU’s Green Deal and the associated climate protection targets. 
The CEO Alliance for Europe’s Recovery, Reform and Resilience 
supports the goal of making the EU the leading region in the 
world in climate protection, accelerating investment, driving in-
novation and thus creating future-proof jobs. The members of 
the alliance see themselves as an “Action Tank” and collaborate 
on a range of concrete joint projects: an EU-wide charging infra-
structure, integration of EU energy systems, a digital Carbon 
Footprint Tracking system, sustainable buildings, electric buses 
for Europe, a value chain for green hydrogen and the establish-
ment of European battery production. The alliance consists of 
companies from various sectors and European nations. 
On the occasion of the European Commission’s presentation of 
the Fit for 55 legislative package, the CEO Alliance issued policy 
recommendations for a progressive and ambitious approach. The 
CEOs’ proposals particularly include strong carbon price signals, 
rapid measures for decarbonizing mobility and transport, the 
transformation of the building sector and a rapid restructuring 
and renewal of the energy system and all EU member states.
In 2021, the CEO Alliance also expressed support for carbon 
pricing across industries and countries and called for political 
decision-makers in Europe to set a strong price signal. Another 
proposal is a European carbon pricing system that would in-
clude measures to simultaneously achieve a social balance and 
emissions reduction. In a contribution to the debate in 2021, the 
Chairman of the Board of Management of the Volkswagen Group 
proposed a minimum price of € 60 per metric ton of CO₂ from 
2023 in Europe. This figure should rise to € 100 by 2026. The  
alliance is also calling for a change to the EU Emissions Trading 
System ETS (for electricity and heavy industries) and additional 
sector-specific emission trading systems for the areas of mobility, 
transportation and buildings. These systems could then converge 
from 2030.

THE MANAGEMENT OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS
The quarterly risk process is used at all Group brands, key  
Group companies and Volkswagen Financial Services AG and 
Volkswagen Bank GmbH to identify and manage acute risks. The 
risks and management measures are documented in the Risk  
Radar risk management IT tool. 
As part of the risk assessment, a score is calculated for each risk 
by multiplying the likelihood of occurrence by the potential  
extent of the damage. This enables comparison of the risks. The 
extent of the damage is calculated from the criteria of financial 
loss and reputational damage and the potential threat to adherence 
to external legal requirements. A score between 0 and 10 is  
assigned to each of these criteria. The measures implemented  
to manage and control risk are taken into account in the risk  
assessment (net perspective). 
The score for a likelihood of occurrence of more than 50% in the 
analysis period is classified as high; for a medium classification, 
the likelihood of occurrence is at least 25%. For the criterion of 
financial loss, the score rises in line with the loss; the highest 
score of 10 is reached when the potential loss is upwards of 
€ 1 billion. The criterion of reputational damage can have charac-
teristics ranging from local erosion of confidence and loss of 
trust at local level to loss of reputation at regional or internation-
al level. The potential threat to adherence to external legal 
requirements is classified based on the influence on the local 
company, the brand or the Group.
The result is a risk score of between 0 and 200 as an expression of 
the risk assessment. A score of 0–10 for the likelihood of occurrence 
is multiplied with a score of 0–20 for the extent of the damage. 
Risk reporting to the committees of Volkswagen AG takes place 
quarterly depending on materiality thresholds. Acute risks from 
a risk score of 40 or potential financial loss of € 1 billion or more 
are presented to the Board of Management and the Audit Com-
mittee of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG. The quarterly 
risk process covers acute risks for our business including risks 
for the achievement of our sustainability goals and thus also 
risks associated with climate change. The focus is on acute risks 
for the next 24 months (short and medium term). In addition, 
long-term risks requiring short- and medium-term counter-
measures are identified and managed using the quarterly risk 
process. We also use competition, environmental and market 
studies to identify risks.

DEFINITION AND PURSUIT OF AMBITIOUS  
DECARBONIZATION TARGETS
The Volkswagen Group wants to become a net carbon neutral 
company by 2050. Compared to 2015, the company wants to  
reduce the carbon footprint of its passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles by 30% per vehicle by as early as 2025. To 
achieve this goal, offset action is also planned alongside carbon 
reduction measures and converting to renewable energies. 
In 2021, the Group intensified its decarbonization targets, sig-
nificantly strengthening its ambitions: the Volkswagen Group is 
aiming to reduce the CO₂ emissions of its passenger cars and light 
vehicles by 30% in production and the use phase between 2018 
and 2030. The plan goes beyond the existing intermediate goals 
for 2025 because the goal for 2030 is to be achieved through pure 
CO₂ reduction. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has  
confirmed to the Volkswagen Group that the Company fulfills  
the conditions for limiting global warming to “well below two  
degrees Celsius” with its decarbonization target. Furthermore, 
during the reporting period Volkswagen committed to increase 
the level of its ambition to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and the SBTi is 
currently assessing this. 
The decarbonization target for 2030 covers not only passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles but also a target for heavy 
trucks and buses from Scania, which represents a sub-target for 
the Group. Scania is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025 compared 
with the base year of 2015. The Scope 3 greenhouse gas emis-
sions from the use of vehicles sold are to be reduced by 20% per 
vehicle kilometer by 2025, also compared with a 2015 baseline. 
The SBTi confirmed to Scania that these targets are at a level that 
allow global warming to be limited to 1.5 °C. MAN also adopted  
a commitment in the reporting year and is aiming for SBTi certi-
fication of the decarbonization target.
The Group’s previous target of reducing CO₂ emissions by 30% 
per vehicle between 2015 and 2025 remains an intermediate 
goal. Because this also includes climate projects offsetting car-
bon, it is not verified by the SBTi. 
The level of ambition for the decarbonization targets is consid-
ered a minimum requirement for the Group brands, which  
are also free to set higher targets themselves. For example, 
Volkswagen wants to reduce its CO₂ emissions per vehicle in  
the EU by 40% and significantly exceed the Group-wide target of 
30% by 2030 (base year of 2018). Porsche aims to become a net 
carbon-neutral company by 2030.
Decarbonization Index for Target Achievement Measurability
In the decarbonization index (DCI), we have a meaningful mea-
suring instrument that makes our progress and interim results 
in this area public and verifiable. The DCI is calculated based on 
the CO₂ emissions over the entire life cycle of the brands of the 
Europe (EU 27, UK, Norway and Iceland), China and US regions 
that manufacture passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. 
In this index, the use phase is calculated over 200,000 km and 
with reference to region-specific fleet values without legal flexi-
bilities. The intensity of the CO₂ emissions from the electricity 
used to charge electric vehicles is also calculated on the basis of 
region-specific energy mixes. Maintenance of the vehicles is not 
taken into account here. Our vehicle life cycle assessments, 
which are used as the data basis for calculating supply chain and  
recycling emissions, have been verified externally and inde-
pendently in accordance with the ISO 14040 standard. During 
the reporting period, luxury brands Bentley, Lamborghini and 
Bugatti were added to the DCI calculation process.
The DCI calculation methodology is regularly adjusted depending 
on internal and external requirements, such as new test cycles 
for fleet emissions. In order to present a methodologically con-
sistent time series, published DCI values can therefore also be  
adjusted to the new methodology and thus changed. The DCI 
computational logic changed during the 2020 reporting period 
as a result of the testing methodology for fleet values being 
changed. Given the fleet regulation rules in force, in 2021 the test 
cycle for measuring consumption and exhaust gas data was 
changed from NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) to WLTP 
(Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure).  
As a result of the more realistic test cycle, higher consumption  
is reported and emissions recorded in the use phase increase 
accordingly.
In the reporting year, the DCI value averaged 45.9 metric tons of 
CO₂ per vehicle. Compared to the WLTP-adjusted value for 2020, 
that represents a reduction of 1.7 metric tons of CO₂ per vehicle. 
The electrification of the portfolio combined with the use of re-
newable energies in production and the use phase is showing a 
significant impact. 
TRANSPARENCY ON CO2 EMISSIONS AS A BASIS 
FOR IMPROVEMENTS 
Every year, we calculate the Group’s carbon footprint using the 
Scope 1 to 3 inventory, in line with the requirements of the  
internationally accepted Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). On this 
basis, we can determine the success of the measures we have put 
in place and identify other areas where we can take action. 
Not shown are additional CO₂ compensation projects, e.g. for the 
carbon-neutral delivery of electric vehicles. The compensation vol-
ume in the reporting period ran to 6.1 million metric tons of CO₂. 
The DCI is to be decreased 
by 30% 
by 2030 compared with the 
base year of 2018.

This equates to 0.9 metric tons of CO₂ per vehicle for all vehicles 
included in the Decarbonization Index.
In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World Busi-
ness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the 
World Resources Institute (WRI), we are reporting CO₂ emissions 
for 13 out of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories in 2021. According to 
this, around 16% of all Scope 3 emissions are in the “Purchased 
goods and services” emissions category, while 76.7% are in the 
“Use phase” emissions category (well to wheel). To calculate use-
phase emissions in the DCI and in the Scope 3 GHG inventory, 
fleet values not including any legal flexibilities are used.
The calculation of CO₂ emissions in the use phase of the Scope 3 
GHG inventory is based on a Group fleet value representing the 
global passenger cars and light commercial vehicles fleet in the 
three major regions (Europe [EU 27, UK, Norway and Iceland], the 
USA and China). In order to provide a picture that is as complete 
as possible, we also collect data on emissions in this category 
that are produced during the production and transportation of 
fuels (“well to tank” emissions).
Fleet CO₂ emissions in Europe (EU27+2)1 
In the reporting period, the Volkswagen Group’s EU (EU27+2)  
passenger car fleet (not including Lamborghini and Bentley) 
emitted an average of 119 g CO₂/km (WLTP)2 in line with statutory 
measurement bases, compared with a statutory target of 
121 g CO₂/km (WLTP)2. This means that the Volkswagen Group  
exceeded the EU’s fleet CO₂ target.
As small volume manufacturers with an independent fleet, the 
Lamborghini and Bentley brands are assessed under European 
CO₂ legislation and both exceeded their individual targets. 
Bentley and Lamborghini will be incorporated in the Volkswagen 
Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU from 2022 onwards. 
The European Commission is pursuing a target of a 15% reduc-
tion in CO₂ by 2025, which corresponds to a CO₂ target of less 
than 105 g CO₂/km for our EU new passenger car fleet. A 55% re-
duction is proposed for 2030, which corresponds to a CO₂ target 
of less than 60 g CO₂/km. We expect our EU new passenger car 
fleet to be able to meet the target for 2025 and outperform the 
target for 2030.
The Volkswagen Group’s new light commercial vehicles fleet in 
the EU emitted an average of 202 g CO₂/km (WLTP) in the 2021  
reporting period as per statutory measurements bases,2 compared 
with a statutory target of 198 g CO₂/km (WLTP)2. Contrary to what 
was originally planned, the target was missed due to the short-
age of semiconductors and the resultant limited availability of 
vehicles. The target for the CO₂ pool established with other manu-
facturers was reached. All the figures mentioned are subject to 
confirmation of the CO₂ data in the context of official publication 
by the European Commission. The European Commission is pur-
suing a target of a 15% reduction in CO₂ by 2025, which corresponds 
to a CO₂ target of less than 175 g CO₂/km for our EU new light 
commercial vehicle fleet. A 50% reduction is proposed for 2030, 
which corresponds to a CO₂ target of less than 115 g CO₂/km. We 
expect our EU new light commercial vehicle fleet to be able to 
meet the target for 2025 and outperform the target for 2030.

In the United Kingdom and Switzerland/Liechtenstein markets, 
the Volkswagen Group’s fleets narrowly missed the statutory 
targets for the 2021 reporting period. 
CO₂ fleet emissions in the USA 
In the USA, the emissions community – consisting of Group 
brands Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, 
Porsche and Bugatti – undertakes to comply with both the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
regulations, which every manufacturer has to comply with in  
relation to passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, factor-
ing in credits for “air conditioning” and “off cycle credits”. Due to 
the delay in the confirmation by the authorities of model years 
differing from the calendar year, internal calculations are used 
to determine the figures for the current and preceding model 
year. The passenger car and light commercial vehicle fleet’s GHG 
CO₂ figure for model year 2021 (internal data as of September 2021) 
is an average of 147 g CO₂/km (model year 2020: 151 g CO₂/km) 
compared with a statutory target of 142 g CO₂/km (model year 
2020: 139 g CO₂/km). By applying the statutory flexibility provid-
ed for regarding GHG and in CAFE as well as externally acquired 
credits, the Volkswagen Group succeeded in complying with ap-
plicable requirements – subject to confirmation by the authori-
ties – for model year 2021. The figure mentioned for model year 
2020 is subject to confirmation by the EPA and CARB authorities.
We anticipate a CO₂ target of around 110 g CO₂/km in the USA 
for 2025 and therefore expect to be able to achieve this target. 
We will increase the electric vehicle proportion of our new vehi-
cle fleet to well over 40% by 2030 and are therefore within the 
current Administration’s target range.

MANAGING TARGET ACHIEVEMENT IN DECARBONIZATION 
The two levers with the greatest influence on greenhouse gas 
emissions across the entire life cycle of Volkswagen products are 
the Group’s electric offensive and the Renewable Energies strategy. 
This strategy involves the integration of renewably generated 
electricity into the use phase of electric vehicles and plug-in  
hybrid electric vehicles and switching plants’ external power 
supply to renewable energy globally. Around 90% of the decar-
bonization targeted by the Group can be realized through  
electrification of the fleet and switching to green energy.
Measures will be implemented and managed through a decar-
bonization program that is being rolled out for the entire Group, 
for all brands and regions. The Group Steering Committee for 
Sustainability is responsible for the program and target achieve-
ment. The Decarbonization Project Center that we founded our-
selves and which includes experts from all brands and depart-
ments is responsible for strategy and target development and 
also for implementation. We use a predefined process overseen 
by the management of the Decarbonization Project Center to 
check measures with which we can achieve the objective of  
decarbonization. All production locations and the brands and  
regions have prepared decarbonization roadmaps. The degree of 
achievement of our targets is measured with a tracking system. 
If we miss the target, we will implement corrective measures.
In the reporting year, TRATON SE launched its own decarboniza-
tion program that is connected with the existing decarboniza-
tion program for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
via interfaces. The considerable CO₂ footprint of heavy commer-
cial vehicles means the Volkswagen Group expects this step and 
the associated measures to result in significant progress in  
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Internal carbon pricing tools are an integral component of our 
decarbonization controlling. When managing the portfolio, we 
work with shadow prices to integrate emission-related risks into 
decision-making processes and with internal emissions trading 
to optimize reduction paths of CO₂ fleet compliance. In the  
decarbonization program, we assess the efficiency of reduction 
measures using abatement costs and aggregate these in an abate-
ment cost curve. In the course of this, we work with an internal 
carbon price or abatement costs of up to € 20 per metric ton of 
CO₂, which is reviewed annually based on target achievement 
and adjusted by a resolution of the Board of Management.

EU TAXONOMY
Doing business in an environmentally sustainable way is one of 
the central challenges of our time. The EU has defined criteria for 
determining the corporate degree of environmental sustainability. 
With our taxonomy-aligned investments in development activi-
ties and in property, plant and equipment, we are today already 
shaping our future in an environ-mentally sustainable way as 
envisaged by the EU taxonomy.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
As part of the European Green Deal, the European Union (EU) has 
placed the topics of climate protection, the environment and sus-
tainability at the heart of its political agenda in order to achieve 
climate neutrality by the year 2050. To this end, the EU Action 
Plan on financing sustainable growth was developed that aims to 
reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment, to main-
stream sustainability in risk management and to foster transpar-
ency and longtermism in financial and economic activity. The  
Action Plan comprises ten measures and centres around the EU 
taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and associated delegated 
acts).
The EU taxonomy is a classification system for sustainable eco-
nomic activities. An economic activity is considered taxonomy- 
eligible if it is listed in the EU taxonomy and can potentially  
contribute to realizing at least one of the following six environ-
mental objectives:
• Climate change mitigation
• Climate change adaptation
• Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
• Transition to a circular economy
• Pollution prevention and control
• Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
An activity is only considered environmentally sustainable,  
i.e. taxonomy-aligned, if it meets all three of the following 
conditions:
• The activity makes a substantial contribution to one of the  
environmental objectives by meeting the screening criteria 
defined for this economic activity, e.g. level of CO₂ emissions 
for the climate change mitigation environmental objective.
• The activity meets the Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) criteria 
defined for this economic activity. These are designed to prevent 
significant harm to one or more of the other environmental ob-
jectives, e.g. from the production process or by the product.
• The activity is carried out in compliance with the minimum 
safeguards, which apply to all economic activities and relate 
primarily to human rights and social and labor standards.
FIRST-TIME REPORTING FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021
Under the EU taxonomy, the Volkswagen Group is required to re-
port on the climate change mitigation and climate change adap-
tation environmental objectives for the first time for fiscal year 
2021; the disclosure requirements extend to the share of eco-
nomic activities that are taxonomy-eligible and that are not  
taxonomy-eligible in sales revenue, capital expenditure and  
operating expenditure. The figures reported relate to the consoli-
dated companies included in the Volkswagen Group’s financial 
statements. Volumes and financial data for our Chinese joint 
ventures are therefore excluded. As the EU taxonomy is being  
applied for the first time, prior-year figures are not provided.
The wording and terminology used in the EU taxonomy are  
currently subject to some uncertainty in interpretation. Our  
interpretation is set out below.
In addition to the current disclosure obligations, we have volun-
tarily assessed our business activities for taxonomy alignment. 
We already report the relevant figures for passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles, and for our hydrogen activities in the 
Power Engineering Business Area.
ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP
In its Group strategy NEW AUTO – Mobility for Generations to 
Come, the Volkswagen Group is driving its transformation towards 
becoming one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable  
mobility. We pay particular attention here to the use of resources 
and the emissions of our product portfolio, as well as those of 
our sites and plants. 
The Volkswagen Group’s activities in its vehicle-related business 
with passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, buses and 
motorcycles cover the development, production and sale of vehicles 
and extend to our financial services and other vehicle-related 
products and services. Activities in these areas are suited under 
the EU taxonomy to making a substantial contribution to the  
environmental objective of climate change mitigation by in-
creasing clean or climate-neutral mobility.
The Volkswagen Group’s activities in the Power Engineering  
Business Area comprise the development, design, production, 
sale and servicing of machinery and equipment. These activities 
also fall under the environmental objective of climate change 
mitigation.
The analysis of the economic activities in the context of the EU 
taxonomy has not revealed any activities that contribute specifi-
cally to the environmental objective of climate change 
adaptation.
The table below sets out the allocation of our activities in the  
vehicle-related business and in Power Engineering to the economic 
activities listed in the EU taxonomy under the environmental 
objective of climate change mitigation. Changes may be made  
to the economic activities in future as the rules around the EU 
taxonomy dynamically evolve.

Economic activities in vehicle-related business
Economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon  
technologies for transport 
We allocate all activities in our vehicle-related business associated 
with the development, production, sale (including financial ser-
vices), operation and servicing of vehicles to this economic activ-
ity. This includes all passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, 
trucks, buses and motorcycles manufactured by us, irrespective 
of their powertrain technology, and also includes genuine parts.
In our vehicle-related business, we have detailed the vehicles 
manufactured by us by model and powertrain technology and 
analyzed the CO₂ emissions associated with them in accordance 
with the WLTP. In this way, we have identified those vehicles 
among all of our taxonomy-eligible vehicles that meet the 
screening criteria and with which the substantial contribution to 
climate change mitigation is measured. These include all of the 
Volkswagen Group’s all-electric vehicles. Until December 31, 
2025, they also include passenger cars and light commercial ve-
hicles with CO₂ emissions of less than 50 g/km. This encompasses 
the majority of our plug-in hybrids. Buses meeting the EURO VI 
standard (Stage E) are also included until December 31, 2022.
At this stage, other activities that are directly associated with the 
primary vehicle-related business and that in our view should al-
so be allocated to this economic activity have not yet been in-
cluded or have been interpreted as not yet being taxonomy-eligi-
ble. This is because, as the rules of the EU taxonomy currently 
stand, it is still unclear where to record them in accordance with 
the EU taxonomy. These activities particularly include the sale of 
engines and power-trains, as well as parts deliveries, the sale of 
non-Group products and production under license by third 
parties. Hedging transactions and individual activities that we 
present primarily under Other sales revenue in the consolidated 
financial statements do not conform to the descriptions of  
economic activities in the EU taxonomy, and we have therefore 
initially classified them as not being taxonomy-eligible.
Economic activities in Power Engineering
In the Power Engineering Business Area, we have analyzed our 
activities with respect to their classification under the EU taxon-
omy and, with the exception of the heavy fuel oil engine new 
building business and individual components for the extraction 
and processing of fossil fuels, have identified them as taxonomy- 
eligible.
Economic activity 3.2 Manufacture of equipment  
for the production and use of hydrogen 
Our activities relating to the manufacture of equipment for the 
production and use of hydrogen that meet the screening criteria 
and make a substantial contribution to the climate change objec-
tive are taxonomy-eligible. One example is the use of green  
hydrogen. At Volkswagen, these include the power-to-X technology 
for the production of low-carbon or carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, 
as well as components for the storage of hydrogen.
Economic activity 3.6 Manufacture of other  
low-carbon technologies 
The description of this economic activity means that only those 
technologies manufactured for the purpose of reducing green-
house gas emissions substantially in other sectors of the econo-
my are taxonomy-eligible. At Volkswagen, this comprises all 
new-build activities that enable the use of gas and climate-neutral 
synthetic fuels (e.g. manufacturing of gas and dual-fuel engines),

(e.g. heat pumps) and all solutions for carbon capture, storage 
and usage; it also includes subsea compression (subsea compres-
sion close to the wellhead for the extraction of natural gas). These 
activities are rounded off by the service and after-sales business, 
comprising the upgrading and modernization of existing equip-
ment. For example, we retrofit existing maritime fleets with 
technology that makes it possible to reduce CO₂ emissions.
Economic activity 9.1 Close to market research,  
development and innovation 
The description of this economic activity includes applied research 
in technologies for the reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas 
emissions. We allocate our licensing business to this economic 
activity. This business provides our development services in the 
form of production documents, based on which our licensees are 
authorized to manufacture corresponding gas and/or dual-fuel 
engines.
For economic activity 3.2 Manufacture of equipment for the pro-
duction and use of hydrogen, we meet the screening criteria that 
are a requirement for the substantial contribution to the climate 
change mitigation objective. Given that the new reporting obli-
gations and the requirements specified therein have only very 
recently been introduced, it was not yet possible to provide  
corresponding proof of economic activities covered by 3.6 Manu-
facture of other low-carbon technologies and 9.1 Close to market 
research, development and innovation.
DO NO SIGNIFICANT HARM (DNSH)
The DNSH criteria were analyzed in the reporting year for eco-
nomic activities covered by 3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon 
technologies for transport and 3.2 Manufacture of equipment  
for the production and use of hydrogen.
In the vehicle-related business, an analysis was performed for 
each vehicle production site where passenger cars, light commercial 
vehicles, trucks and buses are or will be produced that meet the 
screening criteria for the substantial contribution of economic 
activity 3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for trans-
port, or that are to meet them in future according to our five-
year planning. Of the approximately 30 sites included, the major-
ity are located in the EU, with some in the United Kingdom, 
Turkey, the USA, Mexico, Brazil and China. 
For the Power Engineering Business Area, an analysis was per-
formed for each site that produces relevant components for sys-
tems or is responsible for supply chains that meet the screening 
criteria for the substantial contribution of economic activity 3.2 
Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen, 
or that are to meet them in future according to our five-year plan-
ning. There are two such sites, located in Germany and Sweden.
Below, we set out our interpretation and describe the main  
analyses we used to examine whether there was any substantial 
harm to the other environmental objectives. The assessments 
confirm that we meet the requirements of the DNSH criteria in 
the reporting year for the sites producing passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles. The outcome of the evaluation of the 
two Power Engineering sites was also positive.
Climate change adaptation  
We performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to 
identify which production sites may be affected by physical climate 
risks. The physical climate risks we identified were assessed on 
the basis of the lifetime of the relevant fixed asset. 
Volkswagen’s climate-based DNSH assessment is based on Repre-
sentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 to the year 
2050 and thus assumes the highest concentration of CO₂ accord-
ing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
The relevance of the identified threats was assessed for the local 
environment and, if ap-propriate, the measures needed to mitigate 
the risk were developed.  
Sustainable use and protection of water  
and marine resources 
We evaluated our economic activities with respect to the sustain-
able use and protection of water and marine resources looking at 
the three following criteria: preserving water quality, avoiding 
water stress, and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) look-
ing at the impact on water, or a similar process. We based the 
analysis primarily on ISO 14001 certificates, the findings of official 
approval procedures and other external data sources in relation 
to regions exposed to increased risks.
Transition to a circular economy  
Environmentally compatible waste management in the manu-
facturing process, reuse and use of secondary raw materials and 
a long product lifespan are a major part of Volkswagen’s environ-
mental management system. Volkswagen defines clear and  
unambiguous guidelines on the circular economy in its environ-
mental principles, in its overall factory white paper and in its  
goTOzero strategy.
The product-related requirements for passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles are reflected in the implementation of the 
statutory end-of-life vehicle requirements in conjunction with 
the type approval of the vehicle models. In addition to this, each 
brand has targets and measures for the use of recycled materials 
in new vehicles. 
Pollution prevention  
and control  
The DNSH criteria for this environmental objective require that 
the economic activity in question does not lead to substances 
listed in a variety of EU chemical regulations and directives being 
manufactured, placed on the market or used. Approval and mon-
itoring processes are implemented with the aim of ensuring 
compliance with the legislation specified in the DNSH criteria.

Protection and restoration of biodiversity  
and ecosystems   
In order to verify adherence to the requirements on biodiversity 
and ecosystems, the relevant areas were identified. Where biodi-
versity-sensitive areas are located close to a production site, we 
checked whether a nature conservation assessment had been 
performed and whether nature conservation measures had been 
defined in the environmental approvals and subsequently 
implemented.   
MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS
The minimum safeguards consist of the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, the Fundamental Conventions of 
the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the International 
Bill of Human Rights. Below, we describe the main analyses we 
used to examine whether the minimum safeguards are ad-
hered to. 
The Volkswagen Group has 120 production sites in 83 countries, 
including those of the Chinese joint ventures. We conducted hu-
man rights risk assessments for 782 controlled Group companies 
worldwide; this included all sites that were also examined under 
the DNSH criteria. 
For the risks identified in the analysis, the companies received 
risk-specific measures to be implemented by the end of 2021.
Key Performance Indicators in accordance  
with the EU Taxonomy regulation 
The EU taxonomy defines sales revenue, capital expenditure and 
operating expenditure as the key performance indicators that 
must be reported on. Disclosures on taxonomy eligibility are 
mandatory for fiscal year 2021. We have voluntarily assessed our 
business activities for taxonomy alignment and already report 
the relevant figures for passenger cars and light commercial ve-
hicles, and for our hydrogen activities in the Power Engineering 
Business Area.
The financial figures relevant for the Volkswagen Group are 
based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements for fiscal 
year 2021. Where possible, the figures have been directly assigned 
to an economic activity. In our vehicle-related business, for  
example, we compiled the financial figures based on the vehicle 
model and powertrain technology. This applies both to the vehicles 
themselves and to the corresponding financial services and other 
services and activities. Only where this was not possible for capital 
expenditure and operating expenditure, the figures were broken 
down using allocation formulas. In the vehicle-related business, 
we based the allocation formulas on the long-term sales plan and 
the capacity and utilization planning at the individual sites. In 
the Power Engineering Business Area, we used allocation formulas 
based on planned sales revenue. This data and planning form 
part of the medium-term financial planning for the next five 
years, on which the Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board have passed a resolution.

Sales revenue 
The definition of turnover in the EU taxonomy corresponds  
to sales revenue as reported in the IFRS consolidated financial 
statements, which amounted to € 250.2 billion in fiscal year 2021  
(see also note 1 “Sales revenue” in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements).
Of this total, € 225.4 billion, or 90.1% of Group sales, was attribut-
able to economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of low-carbon technol-
ogies for transport and classified as taxonomy-eligible. This in-
cludes sales revenue after sales allowances from new and used 
vehicles, including motorcycles, from genuine parts, from the 
rental and lease business, and from interest and similar income, 
as well as sales revenue directly related to vehicles, such as work-
shop and other services.
Of the taxonomy-eligible sales revenue, € 21.3 billion meet the 
screening criteria used to measure the substantial contribution 
to climate change mitigation. This includes all of our all-electric 
vehicles, the majority of the plug-in hybrids, and the buses meet-
ing the EURO VI standard (Stage E).
Taking into account the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards, 
sales revenue of € 21.1 billion attributable to our passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles, accounting for 8.5% of consolidated 
sales revenue, was taxonomy-aligned. Of this amount, € 14.6 billion, 
or 5.8% of consolidated sales revenue, was attributable to our 
all-electric models (BEVs).
In the Power Engineering Business Area, the majority of our 
 taxonomy-eligible sales revenue was attributable to economic 
activity 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies (€ 2.4 
billion). A further € 13 million was contributed by economic ac-
tivity 9.1 Close to market research, development and innovation. 
Our activities that fall under economic activity 3.2 Manufacture 
of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen recorded 
taxonomy-aligned sales revenue of € 5 million, taking into account 
the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards.
Of the Volkswagen Group’s total sales revenue in fiscal year 2021,
• € 227.8 billion, or 91.0%, was taxonomy-eligible sales revenue and 
• € 21.2 billion, or 8.5%, was taxonomy-aligned sales revenue.

Capital expenditure 
Capital expenditure for the purposes of the EU taxonomy refers 
to the following items in the IFRS consolidated financial state-
ments: additions to intangible assets, additions to property, plant 
and equipment, and additions to lease assets and investment  
property. These are reported in the notes to the 2021 consolidated 
financial statements in note 12 “Intangible assets”, note 13 
“Property, plant and equipment” and note 14 “Lease assets and 
investment property”. Additions from business combinations, 
each of which is reported under “Changes in consolidated 
Group”, are also included. By contrast, additions to goodwill  
are not included in the calculation.
In fiscal year 2021, additions in the Volkswagen Group as defined 
above amounted to
• € 9.1 billion from intangible assets,
• € 10.7 billion from property, plant and equipment and
• € 29.1 billion from lease assets (mainly vehicle leasing  
business) and investment property.
Additions from changes in the consolidated Group, which amounted 
to € 5.1 billion in fiscal year 2021, can also be added to this figure. 
These mostly related to Navistar. Total capital expenditure to be 
included in accordance with the EU taxonomy therefore came to 
€ 54.0 billion.
All capital expenditure attributable to our vehicle-related business 
is associated with economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of low- 
carbon technologies for transport. Taxonomy-eligible capital  
expenditure for the vehicle-related business amounted to € 53.5 
billion, or 99.1% of the Group’s capital expenditure.
To determine the substantial contribution in the vehicle-related 
business, we compiled the financial figures based on the vehicle 
model and powertrain technology, in the same way as for sales 
revenue. Where possible, capital expenditure was directly at-
tributed to vehicles. It was included, if the vehicles in question 
make a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation 
objective. We did not include any capital expenditure directly  
attributable to vehicles that do not meet the screening criteria. 
Capital expenditure that was not clearly attributable to a particular 
vehicle was taken into account on a proportionate basis using 
allocation formulas. In our vehicle-related business, we used 
model- and brand-specific allocation formulas based on the long-
term sales plan and the capacity and utilization planning for the 
Group companies. Depending on the primary business activity, 
allocation formulas from the long-term sales plan were used for 
sales companies, for example, and allocation formulas based on 
the capacity and utilization planning were used for production 
companies. This means that capital expenditure on sites that  
according to our medium-term planning will only produce vehicles 
meeting the screening criteria for the substantial contribution in 
the next five years was counted in full via the allocation formula. In 
contrast, capital expenditure on sites that only produce vehicles 
not meeting the screening criteria was not counted under the  
allocation formula. Calculated in this way, capital expenditure 
relating to vehicles that meet the screening criteria for the sub-
stantial contribution amounted to € 14.4 billion. 
Taking into account the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards, 
capital expenditure of € 14.2 billion on our passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles was taxonomy-aligned. This represented 
26.2% of the Group’s total capital expenditure. This figure in-
cludes additions to capitalized development costs of € 3.5 billion 
and additions to property, plant and equipment of € 3.8 billion 
for our all-electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
(BEVs).
Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure in the Power Engineering 
Business Area has been allocated to economic activity 3.6 Manu-
facture of other low-carbon technologies. Capital expenditure 
was broken down based on planned sales revenue. Taxonomy- 
eligible capital expenditure amounted to € 65 million.
Of the Volkswagen Group’s total capital expenditure in fiscal 
year 2021,
• € 53.6 billion, or 99.2%, was taxonomy-eligible capital  
expenditure and 
• € 14.2 billion, or 26.2%, was taxonomy-aligned capital 
expenditure.

OPERATING EXPENDITURE
Operating expenditure 
The operating expenditure reported by us for the purposes of the 
EU taxonomy comprises non-capitalized research and develop-
ment costs, which can be taken from note 12 “Intangible assets”. 
We also include the expenditure for short-term leases recognised 
in our consolidated financial statements, which can be found in 
note 33 “IFRS 16 (Leases)”, and expenditure for maintenance and 
repairs.
The allocation of operating expenditure to the economic activi-
ties followed the same logic as that described for capital 
expenditure.
All operating expenditure attributable to the vehicle-related 
business is associated with economic activity 3.3 Manufacture of 
low-carbon technologies for transport and has been classified as 
taxonomy-eligible. 
Where possible, non-capitalized research and development costs 
were directly attributed to vehicles. It was included, if the vehi-
cles in question make a substantial contribution to the climate 
change mitigation objective. We did not include any non-capital-
ized research and development costs directly attributable to ve-
hicles that do not meet the screening criteria. Non-capitalized re-
search and development costs that were not clearly attributable 
to a particular vehicle were taken into account on a proportion-
ate basis using allocation formulas. For these and other operat-
ing expenses, the same allocation formulas were used as for capi-
tal expenditure.
Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure in the Power Engi-
neering Business Area falls under economic activity 3.6 Manu-
facture of other low-carbon technologies. As with capital expen-
diture, operating expenditure was broken down on the basis of 
planned sales revenue.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY
STRENGTHENING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY
The finite nature of natural resources and the social and envi-
ronmental consequences of mining raw materials make uncou-
pling economic growth from resource consumption and the  
development of a circular economy key sustainability topics. 
Against this background, businesses such as the Volkswagen 
Group face tighter legal regulation and increasing pressure from 
their stakeholders’ expectations. They also recognize extensive 
opportunities to tap into new business models and markets or to 
give themselves an edge in the competition for limited resources 
with changed use concepts.
The Volkswagen Group created concepts for the reconditioning 
and recycling of vehicle components early on. One important 
driver of the circular economy is the ongoing decarbonization of 
the Volkswagen Group. The growing use of secondary materials 
and the establishment of closed loops of materials help to signifi-
cantly reduce our CO₂ emissions.
In the NEW AUTO Group strategy, the circular economy has been 
defined as a focus topic within the central Group initiatives on 
sustainability. In the strategic design of this action area, we  
orient ourselves on the existing “goTOzero” mission statement. 
With this the Volkswagen Group is setting itself the target of, 
among other things, further improving its resource efficiency 
and promoting reuse and recycling approaches in the areas of 
materials, energy and water. 
 
 Environmental Management
MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY
We want to intensify our efforts for a transition to a loop-oriented 
and resource-conserving way of doing business and to combine 
our projects and measures into a holistic approach. On the way 
to this, we are in close communication with our stakeholders 
and also with legislators and actors in politics and society. We  
also rely on alliances and the implementation of joint projects 
with various partners, such as suppliers, plant manufacturers  
or the recycling sector.
Circular economy is a key issue in Group Initiative 6 of the “NEW 
AUTO – Mobility for Generations to Come” Group strategy. Oliver 
Blume, member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, 
“Sport & Luxury“ brand group, and Dr. Manfred Döss, member 
of the Board of Management responsible for Integrity and Legal 
Affairs, are responsible for Group Initiative 6 as the Board tandem. 
We are currently in the process of putting the objectives in con-
crete terms. The Volkswagen Group is planning to add further 
KPIs that indicate progress in the area of the circular economy to 
the existing KPIs (DCI, reduction of the environmental impact of 
production). The most important measures that we want to take 
to implement the circular-economy strategy include further 
clarifying targets and indicators and also realizing circular 
business models for the most important components and mate-
rials, such as batteries, steel, aluminum or plastics. 
We are currently developing our own working structure at Group 
level for managing the activities. This builds on the work of com-
mittees such as the Group Steering Committee for the Environment 
and Energy, the Group Steering Committee for Sustainability, the 
Group Steering Committee for Product Recycling and the Group 
Working Committee for Environment Product. In terms of 
measures, in production we focus on creating the most closed 
material loops possible with innovative recycling approaches 
and on using renewable raw materials and materials produced 
with low emissions. 
OUR GOAL: CLOSED MATERIAL LOOPS
We are stepping up efforts to use material loops in our production 
processes. When selecting raw materials, we opt for recycled 
ones obtained from production waste or end-of-life products. 
When developing new vehicles, we pay attention to the recy-
clability of the required materials, using high-quality recycled 
material and avoiding pollutants. Under the European Directive 
on end-of-life vehicles, passenger cars and light commercial  
vehicles must be 85% recyclable and 95% recoverable at end of 
life. All our vehicles registered in Europe comply with these 
standards. 
Aluminum Closed Loop at Audi
The Aluminum Closed Loop Project, with which a closed loop for 
aluminum was achieved beyond Company boundaries for the 
first time in the Neckarsulm plant in 2017, is an example of our 
approach. The waste from aluminum sheet-metal parts from the 
press shop is delivered directly back to the suppliers, who can re-
cycle the scrap and use it to produce new material that Audi then 
uses again in the press shop. Compared with using primary alu-
minum, recycling aluminum waste can save up to 95% of the en-
ergy used in manufacturing. In this way, Audi avoids CO₂ emis-
sions and reduces the quantity of primary raw materials needed. 
In addition to the plant in Neckarsulm, the Audi plants in Ingol-
stadt and Győr have now also joined the Aluminum Closed Loop 
process. The process itself and the resultant CO₂ savings of more 
than 720,000 metric tons of CO₂ since 2017 have been verified by 
independent third parties. 
In-House Expertise in Battery Recycling
Volkswagen Group Components opened the Group’s first facility 
for recycling high-voltage vehicle batteries at the Salzgitter site 
at the start of 2021. The objective is industrialized recovery of 
valuable raw materials such as lithium, nickel, manganese and 
cobalt in a closed loop and also of aluminum, copper and plastic, 
with a recycling rate of more than 90% in the future. Batteries 
are only recycled if they can no longer be used in other ways – for 
example, in reconditioned form in mobile energy storage systems 
such as flexible fast charging stations or charging robots. The  
facility has been initially designed to recycle up to 3,600 battery 
systems per year in pilot operation.
GRI 306-2
61
C I R C U L A R  E C O N O M Y
The innovative and CO₂-saving recycling process does not require 
energy-intensive melting in a blast furnace. The used battery  
systems are delivered, deep discharged, and dismantled. The in-
dividual parts are ground into granules in the shredder and then 
dried. In addition to aluminum, copper and plastics, the process 
mainly yields valuable “black powder” containing lithium, nickel, 
manganese, cobalt, and graphite, which are important raw mate-
rials for batteries. The separation and processing of the individual 
substances by hydrometallurgical processes – using water and 
chemical agents – is subsequently carried out by specialized 
partners. As a consequence, essential components of old battery 
cells can be used to produce new cathode material. The material 
recovered can be used to support battery cell production in the 
future. The CO₂ savings are calculated to be approximately 1.3 
metric tons per 62-KWh battery manufactured using cathodes 
made from recycled material and green electricity. That is more 
CO₂ emissions than are generated during the production and lo-
gistics processes of a new ID.3.
Tapping the Potential of Chemical Waste Management 
Numerous components in cars are made of plastics. Quality  
requirements mean that up to now, these can only be made from 
petroleum-based materials and usually cannot be recycled. This 
is because recycling of mixed plastic waste poses a major chal-
lenge, while plastics of the same type can often be mechanically 
recycled. Audi and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) 
have therefore set up a pilot project for chemical recycling as 
part of the Industrial Resource Strategies THINKTANK in order to 
feed such mixed plastic fractions back into a resource-conserving 
circular system. The plastic components are processed into  
pyrolysis oil by chemical recycling. This oil is of equivalent quality 
to petroleum products, and materials made from it are just as 
high quality as virgin material. In the medium term, components 
made from pyrolysis oil can be used again in automobiles and 
thus increase the proportion of sustainably manufactured  
components in cars.
Moreover, in the “SyKuRA” project (systematic recycling of plastics 
from end-of-life vehicles) Volkswagen is working on feeding the 
plastic components from shredder residues from end-of-life  
vehicles into high-quality recycling. Here, too, in addition to im-
proved sourcing technology, it is essential to explore the possi-
bilities of chemical recycling in the form of pyrolysis for fractions 
that are not mechanically recyclable. In addition to Volkswagen, 
the Öko-Institut, the chemical company BASF, processing specialist 
SICON, and the Clausthal University of Technology are also in-
volved in the project, which is supported by the Federal Ministry 
of Research. 
Recycling Production Waste
Any waste with recyclable content generated in production is  
also always systematically included in our closed-loop processes. 
For example, in the Volkswagen Group Components foundry in 
Kassel, all aluminum chips generated on the site are returned to 
the casting process. Around 20 metric tons of aluminum chips 
are produced here each day and melted down in the plant. 
According to forecasts, this alternative to regular aluminum pro-
duction reduces the energy requirements by around 3,250 MWh 
per year and reduces CO₂ emissions by more than 1,400 metric 
tons per year. In the medium term, the foundry wants to melt 
down a further 40 metric tons of material from other European 
Volkswagen plants per day. In the long term, the quantity is set 
to rise to up to 80 metric tons of chips per day.
At the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, plastic waste produced  
in the process of manufacturing tanks will in the future be pre-
pared and used again for the production of tanks. As a result, 
around 1,600 metric tons of material that would otherwise be 
disposed of can be used in plastic tanks in this way each year. 
This can save the plant 2,500 metric tons of CO₂ and € 2 million 
in costs of materials each year.
Use of Recycled Materials in Vehicle Interiors
Using the highest possible proportion of recyclable materials is 
very important for us. In a flagship project for a special ID. family 
model, ceiling headliner, fabrics, carpets, seats, door trim and 
decorative inlays, for example, are being made from sustainable 
material, which consists of up to 100% recycled materials, for 
instance PET bottles. An ID.4, for example, contains material 
equivalent to 140 1.5-liter PET bottles or 380 0.5-liter bottles.
USE OF RENEWABLE RAW MATERIALS 
To reduce our resource consumption, we rely on raw materials 
from renewable sources when manufacturing our vehicles. 
Wherever possible, our Group brands use renewable raw materials 
such as the natural fibers flax, cotton, wood and cellulose.  
Such materials can be used if they comply with all the technical 
requirements and perform better than conventional materials 
over the life cycle. In addition, our sustainability standards apply 
to our suppliers. The following examples illustrate our approach.
 
 Responsibility for Supply Chains and Business
In collaboration with the Technical University of Liberec, ŠKODA 
has developed a sustainable, ecological material made from  
sugar beet pulp, which is used in dyed form in the interior of  
vehicles to create certain design accents. In addition, ŠKODA is 
working on another material based on the miscanthus reed, 
which will also be used in the interior of models in the future. In 
addition, the Group is investigating the use of other ecologically 
sourced materials, such as materials based on coconut fibers or 
rice husks.
RESPONSIBLE USE OF WATER
The supply chain, in particular obtaining and processing raw 
materials, is responsible for the greater part of our water use.  
Because we cannot influence these aspects directly – despite our 
sustainability requirements for suppliers – we concentrate on 
our production sites. Of all the freshwater that we use, 49.3% 
(around 15.8 million m³) is used by sites located in risk zones,

i.e. regions experiencing water shortages, such as Mexico. The 
closed-loop circulation or recirculation of cooling and process 
water mean the need for freshwater and the quantity of waste 
water can be reduced considerably. The San José Chiapa (Mexico) 
Audi site, which can be considered a waste-water-free site due to 
closed-loop circulation, provides a good example of this. As part 
of our “goTOzero” concept, our sustainable water management 
focuses on the following areas of activity: 
• Reduction of freshwater consumption and efficiency in water 
use, particularly in water stress areas 
• Minimization of pollution and no worsening of the environ-
mental and chemical status in the receiving waters (waters  
into which the treated waste water is introduced) 
• Increased soil and groundwater protection when using  
water-polluting substances
We manage water-saving processes at our Group’s locations during 
production in line with Group-wide specifications. In addition, 
Volkswagen supports the CDP Water Disclosure Project (WDP) 
through the transparency of its water management. In 2021, we 
were given the top grade of A in the WDP ranking for our sustain-
able water management and are thus back in the leadership index. 
Given our growing production figures and the integration of new 
sites, our Group’s absolute freshwater use has increased in recent 
years. From 2010 to 2021, the quantity of freshwater used per vehi-
cle decreased by 11.6% per vehicle, thanks to a wide range of recy-
cling measures and to the introduction of manufacturing process-
es requiring little water. The amount of waste water produced is in 
line with the amount of freshwater that we use. Differences in 
quantities between fresh and waste water are the result of evapora-
tion in cooling towers and during the manufacturing process.
SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT
Our waste strategy aims to reduce the quantity of waste we  
produce and to reuse unavoidable waste to create high-quality 
materials – i.e. to close loops. The focus is on: 
• Avoiding waste creation by optimizing production and auxiliary 
processes and increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency)
• Reducing the quantity of waste produced by processing  
waste at sites
• Prioritizing the reuse of waste and reducing the quantity  
of waste that needs to be disposed of
In order to optimize our management of waste, we are increasingly 
using digital waste management systems in all German and a 
number of international production locations of the Volkswagen, 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, Audi and MAN brands. 
They make it easier to control waste management processes and 
facilitate state control of the disposal of hazardous waste.
In order to monitor waste management and recycling processes, 
we carry out regular cross-site, cross-brand and cross-OEM waste 
disposal audits in Germany and the rest of Europe. In addition, 
the auditors receive further training and hold regular discus-
sions to ensure that they have a common understanding of the 
quality requirements associated with waste disposal services, to 
carry out audits of consistently high quality and to allow other 
OEMs and suppliers to take advantage of the findings. 
We reuse waste from manufacturing, logistics, workshops and 
technical development to produce high-quality materials. Our 
Procurement Division has established a Group-wide system for 
recovering waste materials that can generate income – for example, 
paper, plastics, wood, electronic components or metal. Under the 
umbrella of the Zero Impact Factory initiative, we are intensify-
ing our efforts to avoid plastic waste with the Zero Plastic Waste 
project. This includes not only the aforementioned project for  
recycling plastic waste in diesel tank production but also the  
future recognition of initiatives for reducing plastic waste in the 
Volkswagen Group’s Zero Impact Factory Award. Together with 
the Group brands and various departments from environmental 
protection, logistics and the production trades, a “roundtable” 
has also been created. This interdisciplinary working group de-
velops targeted strategies for minimizing the use of plastic pack-
aging. Group-wide regulations that stipulate that any remaining 
plastic packaging should be recyclable were developed for this. 
We test innovative options for avoiding plastics here and are 
guided, wherever possible, by the Group sites’ best practices.
RECYCLING OF VEHICLE PARTS 
AND TOOLS
Overall, the aim of the high quality focus with a low need for  
repair is to give our vehicles long lives in the use phase, thus 
making an important contribution to resource efficiency. 
The brands in the Volkswagen Group also take back many used 
parts from the repair shops, such as engines, transmissions or 
electronics, because these contain valuable raw materials. These 
car parts are industrially remanufactured and tested and can 
then be used in another car again. When they need a repair, our 
customers can decide whether the repair shop should install an 
original part – or whether it is preferable to use a Genuine  
Remanufactured Part. These are comparable to an original part 
in terms of quality but are much lower in price than new parts. 
Using these parts saves large amounts of raw materials, energy 
and CO₂. It is not just vehicle parts that are reconditioned at 
Volkswagen to conserve resources and save costs; production 
tools are too. This is what, for instance, the center of excellence 
for tools at the Salzgitter site is for. An average of 160,000 tools 
have been processed here each year since 2009 to make them 
suitable to return to use. This includes rotary-broaching tools, 
drills or cutters for manufacturing battery anodes and cathodes.

PEOPLE IN THE TRANSFORMATION
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NEW ERA  
OF SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY
The automotive industry is in the middle of a far-reaching  
technological transformation in order to live up rising societal 
expectations, international treaties and political regulations, 
which require targeted decarbonization of products and busi-
ness processes. Shifting from internal combustion engines to 
electric drives, digitally connecting the car with its environment 
or autonomous driving do not just lead to corresponding in-
creases in revenues and higher value-added shares in software 
and electric mobility, digitalization and electrification as drivers 
of future technological development also increase knowledge  
intensity in the sector, with a focus on coding, programming and 
engineering activities. This transition will be completed within a 
decade. This means the whole automotive world is currently in a 
transformation corridor, at the end of which the role of automotive 
manufacturers as employers and the qualifications needed in 
the industry will be radically different from at the start of this 
process. 
The changes the Volkswagen Group has made in its production 
strategy are also impacting the qualifications needed and the 
composition of the workforce. This is becoming particularly  
evident in the continued retrofitting of further plants in the  
reporting year, a process which started in 2020, for instance in 
Emden, Salzgitter and Hanover as well as in Chattanooga in the 
USA. Electric cars are now being built at 12 Volkswagen Group 
sites. In contrast to cars with internal combustion engines, the 
production of e-vehicles is less complex, whereas new fields of 
employment for highly qualified workers are emerging as a result 
of new digital functionalities in the vehicle. Overall, the current 
structure of Volkswagen’s workforce does not yet reflect the ex-
pected changes; for example, around half of employees continue 
to work in manual jobs in production.
It is also to be expected that the transition to NEW AUTO and the 
transformation into a software-driven business could lead to 
asynchronicity in human capital development, for which it is  
vital to prepare. For example, a surplus of staff may arise in tra-
ditional areas, while a shortage is probable on talent markets for 
tech professions, where businesses such as Volkswagen will have 
to compete with IT businesses.
As a result, the Volkswagen Group workforce is facing a ten-year 
process of simultaneous recruitment, job cuts and restructuring. 
This transformation will only be successful if we involve our em-
ployees, train them, prepare them for the forthcoming changes 
as well as possible, give them a clear perspective and allow them 
to participate. We also need to preserve our employees’ perfor-
mance and motivation in this modernization process and seek to 
efficiently manage labor costs in order to stay competitive.
Our aim at Volkswagen is therefore a successful and socially  
responsible transformation of the workforce into the new era of 
sustainable mobility. We want to continue to employ the most 
highly qualified employees possible in attractive, promising pro-
fessional fields, to pay them competitive salaries, and to provide 
secure jobs. 
Transformation in Human Resources as a Focus Topic 
of the New Group Strategy
The responsibility for “people in the transformation” is therefore  
at the core of our current and future activities in human re-
sources. This responsibility extends beyond HR: for the entire 
Volkswagen Group, the transformation of the workforce as part 
of its NEW AUTO Group strategy is defined as one of the central 
focus topics and in connection with this has been launched as a 
separate Group initiative. The Group People Strategy entitled 
“Transform to Tech”, which was also adopted by the Group Board 
of Management in the reporting year, plays a key role here. In 
adopting this new strategy, the Volkswagen Group is continuing 
with the key, successful approaches contained in its Human Re-
sources policy. These include the pronounced stakeholder focus 
in corporate governance, comprehensive participation rights for 
employees, outstanding training opportunities and the principle 
of long-term service through systematic employee retention. 
and remuneration that is fair and transparent. Throughout the 
Group, we offer individual remuneration components for non-
union employees that we continuously update to reflect new 
working realities and business models. 
At the same time, the new Group people strategy is setting inno-
vative trends: the employee experience is being systematically 
improved, teams, as the most important units in the company’s 
organization, are being strengthened and modern forms of 
working such as agile working are set to be expanded. In this 
way, we can increase our employer attractiveness and raise our 
organization’s performance.
66
P E O P L E  I N  T H E  T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
This is why the Volkswagen Group people strategy looks at em-
ployees and their needs throughout the entire work experience: 
“Me@Volkswagen”, “Teams@Volkswagen”, “All of us@
Volkswagen” and “We@Volkswagen and the world around us” 
are the perspectives from which we address employees’ needs 
and expectations in a holistic manner. These four dimensions  
together are what make up the work experience, job satisfaction 
and, ultimately, the success of the work and the Group’s integra-
tion into society.
The first dimension,“Me@Volkswagen”, follows the principle 
that every employee should have the best possible conditions in 
which to do their job. That starts with excellent equipment and 
tools, continues via the avoidance of red tape and overly complex 
process steps through state-of-the-art workspaces, 360-degree 
feedback opportunities, individual health coaching and personal-
ly tailored advanced training opportunities.
The “Teams@Volkswagen” dimension is pivotal to the Group’s 
success: high-performance teams in the Volkswagen Group are 
groups of people that trust one another, have a common goal 
and can rely on one another and that can also discuss issues  
critically and express their opinion. 
“All of us@Volkswagen” describes the corporate culture dimen-
sion. The Volkswagen Group has a strong culture, unique products, 
fair working conditions, safe work, good opportunities for partici-
pation and attractive development paths.
The fourth dimension, “We@Volkswagen and the world around 
us”: without long-term social legitimacy at our locations and in 
our markets, we will not be able to continue our business model 
in times of accelerated changes in values – this applies from an 
economic, environmental and social perspective. Employees are 
representatives of the Volkswagen Group, and they communicate 
our values to society.
As the transformation’s key projects and expansion stages, we are 
pursuing strategic HR planning across the entire Group, an expert 
basis for the transformation through external academic support 
and analysis, the definition of an Employment 2030 vision and the 
implementation of new learning platforms for training with an  
increased training budget.
Although our new Group people strategy “Transform to Tech” 
came into effect in fall 2021, the reporting on the key perfor-
mance indicators for 2021 follows the preceding strategy of  
“Empower to Transform”. As part of the strategy, we collect and 
analyze the following key performance indicators:
•  Internal employer attractiveness: The indicator is derived by 
asking respondents, as part of the Opinion Survey, which is 
conducted in the majority of our Group companies, whether 
they perceive the respective company as an attractive em-
ployer. The target for 2025 is 89.1 out of a possible total of 100 
index points. 86.8 index points were achieved in the reporting 
year, i.e. the target of 88.4 index points was missed. 88.2 
points were achieved in the previous year. For Volkswagen AG, 
the value for 2021 was 87.7 index points (2020: 86.9 points).
•  External employer attractiveness: The ability to recruit top tal-
ent is of decisive importance, particularly in view of the Compa-
ny’s transformation into one of the world’s leading providers of 
sustainable mobility solutions and the associated development 
of new business fields. We use this strategic indicator once a year 
to check the positioning of the major passenger-car-producing 
brands on the labor market for graduates in each brand’s home 
country. Rankings in surveys conducted by Universum, in 
which we aim to achieve individually set, ambitious scores for 
the Group brands featured, serve as the basis for this. In fiscal 
year 2021, the Porsche and ŠKODA brands fully achieved the 
targets set for them, exceeding them in some cases. Whereas 
SEAT was able to realize some of its targets, the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and Audi 
brands did not achieve their targets.

•  Diversity index: Given the cultural diversity in our global  
markets and the growing economic momentum, success in a 
highly competitive marketplace requires an ever-wider range 
of experience, world views, solutions to problems and product 
ideas. The diversity of our workforce provides potential for in-
novation in this area, which we aim to make even better use of 
in future. As we establish diversity management across the 
Group, this strategic indicator expresses the development of 
the proportion of women in management and the internation-
alization of top management as a percentage of the active 
workforce1 worldwide. In particular, it underpins the objective 
of the human resources strategy, which is aimed at contributing 
to an exemplary leadership and corporate culture. The propor-
tion of women in management positions, comprising line 
managers, senior managers and top managers (including 
members of the Group Board of Management), was 16.3% in 
2021, 1.2 percentage points higher than the previous year’s  
level. We aim to raise this figure to 20.2% by 2025. Our goal is 
to increase the level of internationalization in top manage-
ment, the uppermost of our three management tiers, to 25.0% 
by 2025; in the past fiscal year it was 20.3% (2020: 18.7%).
Management of HR Processes through OneHR
We aim to effectively implement our HR strategy by means of  
a standardized structure for the HR departments at the 
Volkswagen AG sites. In 2020, we established the uniform operating 
model OneHR for this in our human resources work. The structure 
of the OneHR organization is based on the Group control units 
for HR principles and management, HR strategy and innovation, 
diversity and advancement of women and on a uniform model 
for personnel support at the plants. In addition, the Group has 
advice centers staffed by experts plus HR business partners that 
provide managers and employees in the business divisions with 
support on all HR issues. After this operating model had first 
been established and continuously optimized in Volkswagen AG, 
implementation was also significantly advanced in the Audi, 
Porsche, MAN and SEAT brands and in Volkswagen Financial Ser-
vices during the reporting year. OneHR thus supports us in pur-
suing and achieving the objectives of our Group people strategy.
Academic Support of the Transformation Process
We see the continuous academic support of the transformation 
as an important factor of its success. For the expert basis and  
operationalization of our new people strategy, we were able to 
draw, in particular, on the findings of the comprehensive research 
project “EMDI@VW – Impact of Electric Mobility and Digitaliza-
tion on the Quality and Quantity of Employment at Volkswagen” 
initiated by the Volkswagen Sustainability Council, which we 
conducted together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial 
Engineering IAO in Germany in 2019 and 2020. 
The completion of the study gave us a clear picture of the areas 
in which we will have to cut jobs and/or recruit in the next few 
years and of what changes are to be expected in qualifications, 
particularly in view of digitalization. In the reporting year, we 
set up a follow-up study on this. In collaboration with the lead 
chair of sociology at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlan-
gen-Nürnberg, we will draw on the findings of the Fraunhofer 
study and explore them in depth to identify potential and re-
sources of people, the organization and learning for shaping the 
digital and environmental transformation. Like the previous study, 
this research will also be financed by the Volkswagen Group’s 
Sustainability Council. The findings will be published in 2022.
Sustainability Principles as the Foundation of HR Work 
Volkswagen is a socially responsible employer, which, as a member 
of the UN Global Compact, follows international sustainability 
frameworks and standards in its HR activities, such as the Sus-
tainable Development Goals, the Global Reporting Initiative and 
recognized ESG standards. Specifically, our activities in daily 
practice are guided by five principles:
• Transparency, responsibility and participation
• Fair and attractive employer
• Increase in diversity and inclusion
• Transformation-oriented human capital development
• Expansion of preventive health and occupational safety

TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION
The Volkswagen Group employs more than 672,000 people, of 
which more than 117,000 at Volkswagen AG. At both Group level 
and in Volkswagen AG, the proportion of women is 17.9%. We work 
in 35 countries in Europe and 37 countries in the Americas, Asia, 
Australia and Africa and operate 120 production sites around  
the world. In all theses places, we assume responsibility for the 
employees and their families, but also for social and economic 
development around our sites. 
In our social charter, we commit to paying all employees the  
legally required national minimum wage that is to be guaranteed, 
to protecting the right to privacy, personal safety and freedom of 
opinion, to the rights of indigenous people and to preventing 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. We acknowledge our re-
sponsibility to open up good development opportunities for our 
employees, to encourage their participation and involvement in 
the work process and to offer a high level of job security.

We are guided in our actions by clear values, especially in the 
transformation phase. The Volkswagen Group Essentials set out 
the common basic values for all brands and companies within 
the Group. Seven simple “We” statements describe what the 
Group stands for: “We take on responsibility for the environ-
ment and society”, “We are honest and speak up when some-
thing is wrong”, “We break new ground”, “We live diversity”, “We 
are proud of the work we do”, “We not me”, “We keep our word”.
Opinion Survey Measures Employee Satisfaction
We attach great importance to actively involving our employees 
in processes and to ensuring that their opinions, assessments 
and criticism are heard – this is also an important element of the 
people strategy in the “Me@Volkswagen” target dimension. In 
our Opinion Survey, an employee survey in which 165 companies 
of the Group took part in 2021, we measure the status of our  
internal employer attractiveness with a targeted question. In  
addition, we are also interested in our employees’ views on the 
questions of where the Group stands on the topic of integrity and 
how they assess working relationships in the Group. The results 
of the Opinion Survey thus serve to identify possible improve-
ments and inform managers of where action needs to be taken in 
their organizational units. In defined follow-up processes, man-
agers take suitable measures in dialog with their employees and 
are supported in doing this by the Opinion Survey Group team, 
which provides various tools for this – such as a method toolbox.
At the regular managers' measures discussion, a discussion of 
the measures derived and their implementation status takes 
place using a top-down approach, beginning with the respective 
division manager/Board member and proceeding to the lowest 
management level. The aim is to ensure the implementation of 
the measures derived from the organizational units in a lasting 
manner.
The 2021 Opinion Survey was carried out at 165 companies in 40 
countries. 466,021 of the 596,905 employees in the companies sur-
veyed responded. This is equivalent to a response rate of 78%. The 
employee satisfaction index, which is calculated from 22 questions, 
is the principal indicator of the Opinion Survey. It is obtained from 
the sum of all the responses to the survey that were given on this 
topic and was 82.3 out of 100 possible index points in 2021 in the 
Volkswagen Group (2020: 82.2 index points), at Volkswagen AG at 
76.2 index points (2020: 74.3 index points).
Transition to Hybrid Work Formats
In the dialog and feedback processes, our employees also told us 
what particular needs they have regarding the new world of  
work that is evolving. For example, like at other companies, at 
Volkswagen the coronavirus crisis above all acted as a catalyst 
for the breakthrough of digitalization in knowledge work. Virtual 
communication and collaboration and new formats of knowledge 
transfer and training – for example, through podcasts or online 
tutorials – were set up and expanded at short notice. 
Hybrid working as a combination of remote working and work-
ing on site is increasingly becoming the norm and requires a 
change of thinking regarding the organization of work and col-
laboration. To this end, the Group launched several initiatives 
during the reporting year. One of these is Volkswagen AG’s Office 
2025 project, a holistic concept spanning the dimensions of people, 
space and technology that focuses on the topics of modular 
working environments, desk sharing and technical infrastructure, 
including hardware and software. 
In July 2021, Volkswagen AG held a “Digital Week” on the hybrid 
working world with numerous interactive events, around 40 
speakers and over 20,000 attendees. The main topics were draft-
ing and applying the company agreement on remote working, 
maintaining mental health, strengthening the management cul-
ture and culture of trust, and the design of office environments,  
including the technical equipment. The Group also developed 
guidelines for digital and hybrid collaboration, which should 
serve as guidance for successful communication and organization 
for employees, managers and teams. This shared focus on success 
in cooperation will be applied across the Group in the future with 
the implementation of the Group people strategy under the 
“Teams@Volkswagen” target dimension.
Employee Ideas Wanted 
Through their creativity, their knowledge and their initiative, 
employees take on responsibility for improving processes and 
products and ultimately help us to achieve our sustainability 
goals. In 2021, more than 12,631 ideas were submitted as part of 
idea management and savings of € 37.6 million were achieved at 
Volkswagen AG’s sites. Volkswagen AG’s innovation fund also 
supports the development of business ideas fit for the future. 
The associated “intrapreneurship” program offers employees  
the opportunity to implement their own business ideas at 
Volkswagen and expand the existing portfolio of services and 
products. It consists of an incubator phase for developing a busi-
ness plan and an accelerator phase for constructing prototypes and 
customer tests. Under an agreement between IG Metall and 
Volkswagen AG, the Group makes € 20 million available to the 
fund each year for projects in new areas of business.
Employee Rights to Participation 
When establishing cooperative labor relations marked by social 
harmony, we are guided by universally valid human rights and 
the standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). 
Volkswagen is committed to global compliance with freedom of

association and recognizes the basic right of all employees to 
form trade unions and workers’ representations. Employees’ 
right to negative freedom of association is also respected. The 
recognition of the right of all employees to form trade unions 
and workers’ representations also includes the value chain and 
represents a key component of the Social Charter. The scope  
of the Social Charter extends to Volkswagen AG and the 
Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies. The principles of  
the Social Charter were also integrated as a component of the  
sustainability requirements in the supply chain and in the 
Volkswagen Code of Conduct for Business Partners. Due to  
different political and legal conditions, implementation of the 
OECD and ILO standards at all global production sites is not  
possible to the same extent as in the European Union. Freedom of 
association is realized in compliance with the laws applicable in the 
various countries and locations. A particular challenge therefore 
arises in states that have not signed the ILO Convention on Freedom 
of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize. 
In order to navigate the tension between the different national 
conditions and the interest in the greatest possible achievement 
of the right to organize, the Volkswagen Group relies on a long 
tradition of also organizing company labor relations in countries 
in which the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association and  
Protection of the Right to Organize has not been recognized. 
Concrete examples include Volkswagen do Brasil Indústria de 
Veículos Automotores Ltda., ŠKODA AUTO Volkswagen India  
Private Limited and Ducati Motor (Thailand) Co., Ltd., where an 
approach to cooperation that goes well beyond the legal frame-
work is taken. Cases of discrimination due to membership of a 
trade union can be reported in the Volkswagen Group’s whistle-
blower system. These cases have, to date, not been recorded as 
separate statistics as the recording of discrimination incidents 
does not differentiate between the causes of the discrimination.
The Volkswagen Group is aware that ESG-related controversies – 
including with regard to the protection of employee rights –  
are becoming increasingly important in investors’ decisions.  
To make how we deal with current and ongoing controversies 
transparent, the Group has provided its own information online.

Governance > ESG Controversies
The form of our working relationships is also managed through 
a number of charters and declarations that we have agreed with 
the Group European Works Council and Global Group Works 
Council. These give our employees security with regard to their 
collective rights at the workplace and set out the principles of 
the Volkswagen Group’s labor policy. Together with the codeter-
mination committees or the employee representatives, we im-
plement these agreements at the respective sites. They include:
•  The Declaration on Social Rights and Industrial Relations at 
Volkswagen (Social Charter), which is geared to the relevant ILO 
conventions
•  The Charter on Labor Relations, which sets out additional infor-
mation, consultation and codetermination rights for employee 
representatives of the brands, companies and locations repre-
sented by the Group European Works Council and the Global 
Group Works Council
•  The Charter on Temporary Work, in which Group manage-
ment as well as the Group European Works Council and the 
Global Group Works Council have agreed on principles relat-
ing to temporary work – for example, guide values for the ra-
tio of temporary to permanent employees, equal pay (for 
equal work), training measures and the limitation of employ-
ment periods with a subsequent review as to whether to take 
on the employee permanently
•  The Charter on Vocational Education and Training, in which 
professional training is anchored as a central part of Charter 
on Labor Relations
In addition, there are a number of locally applicable agreements 
with the relevant responsible trade unions that stipulate, for  
example, standards for further training and for preventive 
healthcare measures. These fundamental standards and agree-
ments underpin the rights of employees and their elected  
representatives at Group level in the Group European Works 
Council and the Global Group Works Council. Executive managers 
and employee representatives meet regularly to consult on rele-
vant issues. All members of the Group European Works Council 
and the Global Group Works Council attend at least one joint 
session of the two works councils every year. As well as discuss-
ing the current situation at the various sites, the respective HR 
managers and Group executive management also share infor-
mation about product and workforce plans as well as social  
welfare and personnel standards.
Cooperative Organization of Labor Relations 
at Brands and Companies
We want to enable the most comprehensive representation of 
employee interests possible in our Group. We cooperate with the 
relevant trade unions all over the world. Many companies in the 
Group also have a supervisory board on which the workforce is 
represented. In this way, Volkswagen’s Commercial Vehicle divi-
sion, with the holding company TRATON SE and its subsidiaries 
MAN, Scania, Navistar and Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus,  
enables far-reaching participation of employee representatives. 
The TRATON SE Works Council can, for example, exercise extensive 
rights of information and consultation within the framework of 
a participation agreement between the board of management 
and employee representatives. The agreement also regulates the 
equal representation of employee representatives in the highest 
body of TRATON SE – the supervisory board. Scania also has a Eu-
ropean works council with participation rights, the SEC (Scania 
European Committee). In addition, Scania has introduced a global 
corporate policy that regulates minimum standards such as 
working hours, weekly rest periods, vacation time and sick leave 
for its employees. Moreover, the Swedish truck brand is an active 
GRI 402-1

P E O P L E  I N  T H E  T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
partner of the Global Deal platform, a multi-stakeholder initiative 
for social dialog and partnership between governments, companies, 
employers’ associations and trade unions.
The Charter on Labor Relations additionally allows employee 
representatives around the world to conclude agreements with 
local management on specific rights to information, consultation 
and co-determination. This far-reaching form of participation 
has proved highly successful over many decades. 
FAIR AND ATTRACTIVE EMPLOYER
 
We believe that an attractive employer is first and foremost a fair 
employer. That is why we adhere to the relevant national legal 
standards when dealing with all matters that affect our personnel. 
However, in line with our tradition of social partnership and the 
balancing of interests, we go beyond these standards; we would 
like to allow all our employees throughout the world to share in 
Volkswagen’s social achievements and its high work and social 
standards.
Participation, initiative and individual creative opportunities 
are particularly important when it comes to keeping our prom-
ise to be an excellent employer. We would like our employees to 
be responsible, competent and confident “Company citizens” 
who actively take part in company affairs and get involved in  
decision-making processes. “Me@Volkswagen” – one of the target 
levels of the new people strategy – is based on precisely this 
principle.
Social Compatibility of the Transformation in Focus
Collective job security agreements play an important role in the 
transformation. In Volkswagen AG in Germany, the job security 
applies until 2029 as a result of the Digital Transformation Road-
map, which underlines our appreciation for industrial work. 
From 2019 until 2023 and beyond, Volkswagen AG is investing up 
to € 4 billion in major digitalization projects and efficient admin-
istration within this framework in Germany. 
We also strive to act in a socially responsible way anywhere we 
have to cut jobs for economic reasons. For example, as it did many 
other companies, the coronavirus pandemic also challenged 
Volkswagen do Brasil to reduce fixed costs. Volkswagen do Brasil, 
metalworker trade unions and employee representatives of all 
four plants came together to negotiate a restructuring agree-
ment. In addition to cost-cutting, it was also a matter of applying 
flexibility measures and adjusting the headcount through a pro-
gram of voluntary resignations.
At MAN, partial retirement contracts, termination agreements, a 
change of Group and the establishment of a transfer company 
were used as tools for the socially responsible headcount reduc-
tion that was also necessary there. The basis for this was the  
negotiation of a joint key issues paper between the company’s 
management and the employee representatives. The corresponding 
rules and programs that were implemented in the reporting year 
continue to apply until 2023.
We provide the HR answers to various challenges at a national or 
international level with future-proofing programs that we have 
concluded as part of codetermination. For example, Germany 
and other parts of Western Europe face not only risks resulting 
from demographic changes but continue to face shortages of 
skilled workers who we will need for cutting-edge areas of work. 
In order to fill jobs with experienced and creative IT, digitaliza-
tion and electrification experts even more to the benefit of the 
candidates, we are strengthening our efforts in digitalizing the 
internal recruitment processes. 
Applicants are at the heart of our activities, and we are increas-
ingly addressing them via digital formats due to the current  
situation. This also includes our “Hello Possible 2.0” recruit-
ment campaign for the Volkswagen brand, which we ran exclu-
sively in digital space and which is aimed at selected experts 
from the areas of intuitive operability, digital transformation 
and emission-free mobility.
Commitment to External Employer Attractiveness
The transformation requires particular dedication to acquiring 
top talent. An indicator for this is external employer attractive-
ness. In addition to measuring external employer attractiveness, 
which includes rankings in surveys conducted by Universum for 
the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles, Audi, ŠKODA, SEAT and Porsche brands (p. 77), we compile a 
strategic KPI for Volkswagen Financial Services AG: the external 
employer ranking. This involves taking part in the “Great Place 
to Work” external benchmarking, in general once every two 
years. The aim is to position ourselves as an attractive employer 
and derive appropriate measures to achieve a ranking among the 
top 20 employers by 2025 – not just in Europe, but globally. For 
2023, we plan to participate in this ranking on a global scale.  
In competition with other European employers, we achieved  
that targeted top 20 ranking. In 2021, Volkswagen Financial  
Services AG was represented in further national and inter-
national best-employer rankings. 
Fair and Transparent Pay
A fair and transparent pay system and payment of fair remunera-
tion make a significant contribution to employees’ job satisfac-
tion. In accordance with our Social Charter, the remuneration 
and fringe benefits for our employees correspond at least to the 
legally required minimum level which is to be guaranteed in the 
particular country. As they are collectively agreed with trade 
unions, our rates of pay are usually higher than the prevailing 
minimum levels. Our employees are generally selected, hired 
and promoted on the basis of their qualifications, experience 
and abilities. Individual pay is based on the job performed.
The remuneration system not only reflects the corporate culture 
but also the organization of work and represents a significant 
GRI 402-1, 404-2
71
P E O P L E  I N  T H E  T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
competitive factor for the Group. The gradual transition from old 
product range to new also comes into play in matters of pay. For 
example, changes in work, roles and expertise also need to be  
reclassified with respect to their value. 
Employees of Group companies enjoy further Company benefits. 
Depending on location, these may include subsidized transport 
and meals, employee terms at cooperation partners and discounts 
on certain leisure activities. Additional healthcare or supplemen-
tary pension benefits may round off the range of company benefits 
at specific sites. By offering occupational pension schemes, 
Volkswagen AG and many of its brands and subsidiaries make an 
important contribution towards securing their employees’ income 
in old age. Employee participation in the Company’s success in 
the form of an employee share program – such as a stock option 
plan – is not currently offered.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Information on strategies, measures and programs, including 
on enabling a better work/life balance is summarized in the 
chapter on the focus topic of diversity. 
 
 
 Diversity
TRANSFORMATION-ORIENTED  
HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
As an employer, we want our employees to be able to work creat-
ing value at workplaces in our Group for their entire working 
lives. This requires not just for them to retain their health, but  
also adjusting skills and capabilities to the quickly changing envi-
ronment. That is why training our employees and adjustment to 
new work and career profiles is a key action area in the workforce 
transformation. This is because the comprehensive specialist 
qualifications of our employees remain the basis for the highest 
technological excellence. The electrification of the vehicle fleet, 
the transition towards connected, autonomous driving and the 
digital transformation of our Group mean that employees already 
need very different qualifications today. We handle these changes 
with our comprehensive training system with its individual train-
ing measures, which is also part of the gradual implementation of 
our new people strategy with the target focus of “Me@Volkswagen”.
Dual vocational training at the Volkswagen Group supports the 
workforce transformation. With its flexible combination of 
practical activities and theoretical knowledge, vocational train-
ing prepares our young professionals for the forthcoming chal-
lenges. On an international level, we are guided by the high  
German training standards but also comply with the relevant 
national standards and regulations.
In 2021, the Volkswagen Group trained 17,151 young people. We 
also support the career development of new entrants once they 
have completed their apprenticeship. For example, particularly 
talented young specialists are nurtured in talent groups.
Training Skilled Workers and Managers
At the Volkswagen Group Academy, which is responsible for vo-
cational and advanced training, skilled workers can choose from 
a broad range of advanced training courses. These range from 
further training on topics of the future and occupational or 
cross-disciplinary areas of general interest to specific qualifications 
in vocational groups and even comprehensive personnel 
develop ment programs. The COVID-19 pandemic meant that  
only a restricted range of options was available again in 2021, 
particularly in multidisciplinary areas. This went hand in hand 
with a greater shift from classroom seminars to online semi-
nars. In 2021, a start was also made on creating a new learning 
ecosystem, which will be used to continuously expand the learn-
ing options through a platform solution. The “Individual career 
orientation” (ICO) module offers all Volkswagen AG employees 
the opportunity to reflect on career goals, interests and personal 
skills and compare these with the development opportunities in 
the Group. Various methods of self-reflection or assessment by 
others, practical exercises, literature recommendations, seminars 
and podcasts are also offered in a toolkit.
The leadership and management programs and training were 
further developed in 2021 and their content updated to adapt 
them to future requirements. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand’s foreman base training (FBT) and manager base training 
(MBT) were revised in the reporting year. The manager base 
training has also had agile management content added. In addi-
tion, there is a program for future managers of the Volkswagen 
brand, the management development program, which focuses 
on corporate culture, diversity, compliance & integrity, and  
personal responsibility. Two new modules train prospective 
managers on agility in day-to-day management. For newly  
appointed managers of the Volkswagen brand, the new manage-
ment program launched in 2020 with the company Malik  
St. Gallen was continued in the reporting year. Its objective is  
to strengthen managers’ ability to deal with the challenges of  
the transformation using scientifically based leadership and 
management models. For experienced managers, the Group-
wide senior management program provides high-quality knowl-
edge from research and practice with focuses on customer focus, 
innovation and leadership, which have been supplemented by 
learning content including design thinking methods, tools such 
as Triple Impact and Lean Canvas, and decision biases. We set up 
this human capital development program with Paris business 
school HEC and the Potsdam Hasso Plattner Institute Academy. 
The Volkswagen Group has also compiled a decentralized training 
and qualifications catalog for its managers, and these qualifica-
tions are conceptually designed by individual brands and can be 
used by other brands. For example, the Group Leadership Academy 
provides seminars that support and inspire management in the 
transformation of the Group with the Group Training Catalog for 
Leadership and Transformation. Under coronavirus conditions, 
160 managers took part in nine pilot training courses across the 
Group in fiscal year 2021. This builds on the enormous stock of 
know-how and experience for manager training, uses synergies 
GRI 404-2

P E O P L E  I N  T H E  T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
between the brands and expands knowledge transfer and net-
working. For example, the “Building a sustainable organization. 
Together.” training teaches how sustainability can be proactively 
factored into operational management decisions. 
The Transform Leadership 2030 program provides the opportunity 
to explore all the aspects of the transformation in dialog with ex-
perts and members of the Board of Management in eight core mod-
ules and, in particular, to deepen technology-specific knowledge. 
Promoting Agility and Cultural Change
In view of the many upheavals and to strengthen a culture of  
cooperation, the Volkswagen Group puts a special emphasis on 
employees’ ability to act agilely and entrepreneurially. Until 
2020, there was, however, a lack of uniform standards that define 
concrete agile skills. We therefore developed a skills matrix for 
training in the area of agile business processes together with 30 
major listed companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland 
in the DACH30 initiative. In the course of this, the Volkswagen 
Group Academy established a training portfolio on agility. 
In order to actively support divisions, departments and project 
teams with implementing strategic realignments, the Culture & 
Change Factory was founded at Volkswagen in 2021. The new 
unit under the umbrella of the Group Academy supports and 
steers various transformation projects with around 40 experts. 
The team’s expertise includes change management, culture 
change, agile training, coaching, process design and continuing 
training. 
Investment in Development of Skills for New Technologies
In the current upheaval of the automotive industry, the 
Volkswagen Group’s particular training focus is on training  
employees on important future technologies and closely sup-
porting them in the transformation process. For example, 
Volkswagen specifically added new courses on the topic of  
e-mobility to its professional training program at the site in 
Chattanooga, USA, with the aid of the Volkswagen Group  
Academy. It largely comprises the two program lines high- 
voltage qualification and automation qualification, which had 
around 3,000 participants in the reporting year. We plan to ex-
pand the training programs to include the topics of 3D printing, 
cybersecurity and robotics in the future.
By 2023, Volkswagen AG wants to create at least 2,000 new jobs 
connected to digitalization at its traditional West German sites. 
For the HR transformation in the course of the digitalization 
drive, the Group is increasing its training budget relating to new 
technologies by € 40 million to a total of around € 200 million, 
around € 126 million of which had already been released by the 
end of 2021. 
In particular , we are broadening the knowledge base for the digital 
transformation in the Group with the Faculty 73 program. We 
train 100 software developers each year here for our own needs. 
The two-year training program is designed for employees and 
external applicants with an affinity for IT. The future experts  
acquire all the necessary skills for a successful career as a soft-
ware developer in the automotive industry within the training. 
In 2021, we placed all 94 graduates of the first phase of the pro-
gram within Volkswagen AG and CARIAD. In March 2021, 100 
people became the third year of students to begin the training 
program. 
Volkswagen AG and CARIAD have also encouraged the establish-
ment of innovative programming schools in Wolfsburg and  
Berlin in cooperation with the non-profit École 42. The training 
institute in Wolfsburg commenced operations in May 2021 with 
170 students from 30 countries. By the end of 2022, 600 students 
in Wolfsburg and Berlin are to be admitted and learn from and 
with each other in line with an innovative training concept. Like 
at École 42 in Paris, the free training at 42Wolfsburg and 42Berlin 
is also open to applicants who have not graduated high school or 
college, irrespective of their age, sex or origin.
PREVENTIVE HEALTH AND  
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
The Volkswagen Group and its HR division continued to have to 
deal with the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic in 2021 
and therefore had to respond to challenges that needed to be 
handled at the same time as the transformation work. For example, 
HR repeatedly had to deal with production downtime caused by 
regional outbreaks of the pandemic and adapt activities to pro-
tect employees at the various sites in line with the threat 
situation.
In addition to this central task currently facing us, we are fur-
ther expanding preventive health and occupational safety in 
the Volkswagen Group. This is because physical and mental 
well-being are important if employees are to perform well at 
work and cope with the stress typical of working in a changing 
production company. We have also committed ourselves to this 
goal of promoting optimum health within the framework of the 
Group people strategy under the “Me@Volkswagen” target 
dimension.
In the area of health, sustainability means for us that we want to 
help every employee to retire healthy. This long-term approach 
also helps our Group to cope with demographic change in the 
form of an aging population, which is now typical of many in-
dustrial countries in which we operate.
Holistic health management at Volkswagen already goes beyond 
the statutory preventive healthcare and occupational health 
and safety requirements. It also includes aspects such as work 
organization, ergonomics, prevention, integration and rehabili-
tation, along with leadership culture.

Group Policy Regulates Occupational Health and Safety
Our employees receive medical care at all our sites in accordance 
with the relevant national legal regulations and internal rules and 
on the basis of Group guidelines on protecting and promoting 
health. All Group sites have at least one facility for dealing with 
medical emergencies. Most of them also offer medical care pro-
vided by a company doctor. 
A Group policy regulates the responsibility for occupational 
health and safety uniformly for all the Group’s brands and  
companies. Health care is managed at Group level by the Head of 
Group Occupational Health and Safety, who is also Volkswagen AG’s 
senior physician. They report directly to the Chief Human  
Resources Officer, reporting to the latter on the topics of health 
and occupational safety.
The Group Steering Committee for Health Care makes decisions 
on strategic direction and coordinates topics of fundamental  
importance across brands. The steering committee initiates  
projects, ensures the transparency of expert knowledge and  
organizes the leveraging of synergies in health care. Its partici-
pants are the Head of Group Health Care and the brands’ heads of 
health care or their representatives. The Group Steering Commit-
tee for Occupational Safety makes decisions on the strategic  
direction and the development of occupational safety. Its  
participants are the Head of Group Occupational Safety and the 
brands’ heads of occupational safety or their representatives.
In addition to meeting statutory requirements, Volkswagen’s 
Health department focuses to a large extent on preventive ap-
proaches. Employees are therefore offered regular checkups. As 
part of the discussion of the checkup findings, employees are 
offered customized healthcare services based on new scientific 
knowledge. However, the pandemic meant it was only possible 
to maintain these services to a very restricted degree in the re-
porting year. In fiscal year 2021, the Health department carried 
out ten initial and 38 subsequent checkups in Volkswagen AG. 
Since the introduction of the service in 2010, a total of 86,027 
Volkswagen checkups have been completed (active permanent 
workforce). 
Diverse Programs for Combating the Pandemic
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Volkswagen’s Health 
department began operating its own PCR test facilities at all 
Volkswagen AG sites at an early stage in order to minimize the 
risk of cluster outbreaks and protect employees and the Group 
as well as possible. In addition, Volkswagen also made its PCR 
test infrastructure available to public health departments at the 
sites and thus reduced the burden on the public health service.
In addition, the Volkswagen Health department set up and  
operated its own vaccination centers at 31 sites for a high level 
of protection against infection. 332,004 coronavirus vaccina-
tions were given across the Group in 2021 (Volkswagen AG: 
91,874). Here too, Volkswagen assumed social responsibility and 
opened the vaccination centers in some Group companies for 
people outside the Group.
The Wolfsburg Volkswagen plant’s health department also 
launched a project for monitoring waste water in mid 2021 in 
order to establish an early warning system for infection clusters 
via the changes in the viral load in wastewater. This project adds 
to the range of coronavirus protection measures at an early stage. 
High Standards for Occupational Safety 
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the 
continuous improvement of occupational health and safety is 
vitally important to us. In 2004, the Volkswagen Group adopted 
an internationally valid occupational safety policy. Among other 
things, it is intended to promote the development of concepts in 
Group companies for continually improving occupational safety 
at work. 
In the area of occupational safety, sustainability means for  
us that employees do not suffer accidents when working. 
Volkswagen is supporting this objective through the introduc-
tion of the Safety First strategy. The vision of this strategy is to 
anchor “safety first” as a guiding principle in the actions of all 
managers and employees. All occupational safety processes are 
to be known and to be applied reliably. Workplaces are to be safe 
and the Occupational Safety department is to be involved in 
shaping them. All managers and employees are to be informed 
and trained and act in line with safety requirements.
The strategy requires all Volkswagen Group production sites to 
comply with the standards of ISO 45001 occupational health 
and safety management systems and more specific Group  
requirements. At the end of 2021, a total of 48 (2020: 46) Group 
sites were certified in accordance with ISO 45001. This cor-
responds to coverage of 29% of the Volkswagen Group’s 
employees.
In addition to the number of ISO 45001 certificates and their 
level of coverage, the Volkswagen Group uses the accident  
frequency and accident severity for employees excluding  
temporary agency workers as key performance indicators for  
reporting. The accident frequency index provides information 
on the number of accidents at work as a proportion of the total 
of all hours worked. The underlying calculation formula is: 
number of accidents at work reported x 1 million ÷ the total 
number of hours worked. The accident severity index expresses 
the severity of the accidents reported by showing the total number 
of working days lost due to accidents reported in the fiscal year 
as a proportion of the total of all hours worked. The underlying 
calculation formula is: number of working days lost through ac-
cidents reported in the fiscal year x 100,000 ÷ the number of 
hours worked. The Group uses a Group process standard to pro-
vide cross-brand information in the event of serious or fatal ac-
cidents involving our own employees or workers from partner 
firms. On this basis, specific measures can be taken to prevent 
similar accidents across all our sites in the future. 
GRI 404-2
74
P E O P L E  I N  T H E  T R A N S F O R M AT I O N
In 2021, the accident frequency1 was 3.7 (2020: 3.6) in the 
Volkswagen Group and 6.8 (2020: 5.5) in Volkswagen AG. The  
accident severity1 was 5.7 (2020: 5.1) in the Volkswagen Group 
and 9.1 (2020: 7.4) in Volkswagen AG. The Volkswagen Group  
and Volkswagen AG recorded one fatal accident involving our 
own employees in the reporting year. 
Volkswagen Sites Recognized for High Occupational Safety
The Board of Management awards occupational safety trophies 
each year for the best plant in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand in Europe. The best vehicle plant and the best component 
plant of the Volkswagen brand in Europe were also awarded 
prizes for the progress on reducing accident numbers. The tro-
phies for 2019 and 2020 were awarded in Wolfsburg in October 
of the reporting year.  
 
MANAGING THE WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION 
AND MAKING IT MEASURABLE
 
We resolutely want to follow the path described above and be 
measured by tangible progress in reaching our targets. To this 
end, we will in future use strategic KPIs, such as training hours 
completed by employees, employer attractiveness as part of the 
Opinion Survey and the diversity index.

CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Especially during the transformation, our HR policy’s core tasks 
include creating a working environment in which talent of any 
age or gender, irrespective of origin and cultural background, 
can optimally contribute skills and viewpoints. The basis for this 
is an open, positive and partnership-based culture, a high level 
of diversity in the workforce and exemplary and inspiring leader-
ship. Diversity, respect, tolerance and equality of opportunity are 
critical success factors for an open corporate culture. It increases 
employee motivation and performance as well as our customers’ 
satisfaction.
INTEGRATION INTO GROUP STRATEGY
Diversity was defined as a focus topic for sustainability as part of 
the NEW AUTO Group strategy and the Group initiative derived 
from it. The particular importance of this action area is further 
underpinned in the Volkswagen Group by the fact that the diver-
sity index1 as a strategic KPI has acquired direct remuneration 
relevance at Group Board of Management level.
We have also codified the aim of diverse workforces in key docu-
ments. The declaration “We live diversity” as one of the seven 
Group Essentials is thus a firm part of the Volkswagen Group’s 
cultural DNA. Safeguarding and promoting diversity and equal 
opportunities is also an important component of the Group’s HR 
Compliance policy.
DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHED  
ACROSS THE GROUP
Group diversity management is directly assigned to the member 
of the Board of Management with responsibility for Human  
Resources and reports to this individual. We have enshrined the 
topic of diversity and equal opportunities in the HR Compliance 
Group policy. More than 110 diversity managers are working on 
the topic in the Volkswagen Group. They meet at an annual di-
versity convention to promote the sharing of best practices and 
to discuss the implementation of programs and action.
TRAINING AS A SUCCESS FACTOR FOR 
DIVERSITY WINS@VOLKSWAGEN
Through our diversity management and the implementation of 
the Diversity Wins@Volkswagen program, we want to deliberate-
ly expand approaches for promoting diversity and inclusion. We 
pursue a holistic approach that considers diversity in its over-
riding importance for businesses and society and does not give 
priority to the needs of any particular group. 
Mandatory training for managers from foremen to top managers 
is a key pillar of the program. The training participants develop 
an understanding of why diversity and inclusion are important 
for the Group, what design approaches and activities can be  
developed and what responsibility as a manager means  
in concrete terms. Managers are primarily to be supported and 
encouraged in avoiding unconscious bias – i.e. unconscious  
prejudice and stereotypes – in their decisions. We have set our-
selves a target of training 75% of around 28,300 managers across 
the Group and worldwide by December 31, 2021. We outper-
formed the target, achieving a ratio of 83%. Participation in the 
training is tracked.
ENCOURAGEMENT OF NETWORKS
The Volkswagen Group supports the formation of employee  
networks to promote personal initiative and the willingness to 
take on responsibility. This includes, for example, the LGBTQI+ & 
friends network “We Drive Proud”, which not only represents the 
interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender+, intersex+ and 
queer people, but first and foremost helps to shape cultural 
change in the Group. “We Drive Proud” sees itself as an open, 
Group-wide initiative that maintains dialog with existing net-
works, e.g. those at Audi, Porsche or SEAT. The establishment of 
fathers’ networks was also further supported. There are now ad-
ditional networks at Audi (“Dads @ Audi”) and at Volkswagen 
Group Components (“VäterConnection”).
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THROUGH THE 
DIVERSITY PANEL AND DIVERSITY CHARTER
The Volkswagen Group created an advisory committee in the 
form of the Diversity Panel in 2021. This was one of the measures 
with which the Group responded to accusations of racism relat-
ing to a video advertising the Golf VIII. The panel includes ex-
perts from civil society, business and academia but also high- 
ranking managers from various areas of the Group. The aim is to 
raise awareness of discriminatory content and conduct and  
enhance in-house skills to systematically counteract everyday 
discrimination and racisim. The panel met three times in the  
reporting year and issued concrete recommendations for action 
regarding organization, processes and activities in the Group.  
An exchange in the Group IT department’s data lab in Munich 
regarding discrimination by algorithms and various open talks 
with the workforce on the topic of everyday racism have already 
taken place. The diversity panel also maintains regular commu-
nication with the Volkswagen Group’s Sustainability Council. 
The Volkswagen Group has also underscored its commitment  
to diversity in Germany by its signature of and financial support  
for the Diversity Charter initiative and through Chefsache – a  
network of managers from business, academia, the public sector 
and the media for promoting equal opportunities for women 
and men.

OBJECTIVES AND KPIS 
We not only want to establish processes geared to equal oppor-
tunities but also aim to set targets for measures and programs at  
all levels of management. Our diversity approach centers around 
quotas for women in managerial positions and targets for the 
internationality of our top management. These two figures are 
combined in our diversity index, which has been in force since 
January 1, 2017.
The diversity index forms part of our Group people strategy  
and data are collected for the whole Volkswagen Group with its 
active workforce.3 We use this index to manage and measure  
the implementation of our targets. At 16.3% in 2021, the propor-
tion of women in management – comprising managers,  
senior managers and top managers (including the members  
of the Group Board of Management) – was significantly higher 
than the previous year’s level. We aim to raise this figure to 
20.2% by 2025.

³ Adjustment of figure for 2020.
We aim to increase the level of internationalization in top man-
agement, the uppermost of our three management tiers, to 25.0 % 
by 2025. In the past fiscal year this was 20.3 % (2020: 18.7 %).
The figures for the proportion of women and internationaliza-
tion are each included with equal weighting in an index that was 
set to 100 in each case for 2016. Both indices were included in 
equal proportions when setting targets and in the compilation 
of the overall index (proportion of women figure and top man-
agement internationalization figure). An increase in this index 
to 129 was planned for 2021. This target was narrowly missed 
with a figure of 127. The targets are decided by the Group Board 
of Management.
Pursuing Goals for Increasing the Proportion of Women 
We have also formulated goals as regards the proportion of 
women in management for Volkswagen AG in accordance with 
section 76 (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz 
– AktG). In line with the German Act on the Equal Participation  
of Women and Men in Executive Positions (Gesetz für die 
gleich berech tigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungs-
positionen) and section 76 (4) of the German Stock Corporation 
Act, Volkswagen AG achieved the targets set in the reporting 
year: by December 31, 2021 the proportion of women in the  
active workforce at the first level of management (senior managers, 
top managers and brand board of management members) had 
reached 13.5% (target: 13.0%) and at the second level of  
management (non-senior managers) it was 18.3% (target: 16.9%). 
For the new period until the end of 2025, Volkswagen AG has set 
itself the target of having a proportion of women of 16.5% for 
the first level of management and of 23.4% for the second level 
within the active workforce. The Group’s Board of Management 
and Supervisory Board are regularly updated on the progress we 
are making towards these targets.

Programs for Greater Equality of Opportunity  
in Career Development 
By offering various programs, we are aiming at increasing the 
proportion of women at management levels within the Group 
and at ensuring greater equality of opportunity and equal rights 
in career development. The Volkswagen AG-wide Kompass 2.0 
program provides female talent with guidance and a decision aid 
for starting a management or leadership career. The program 
centers around a nine-month period of mentoring accompanied 
by networking days, dialog events, seminars and feedback meet-
ings. 162 employees are taking part in the current 2021/2022 
round of the program.
The Volkswagen AG-wide modular mentoring management  
program is designed for all talent, whether female or male, in the 
development phase of management development. It is intended 
to raise awareness of the importance of gender diversity and 
equal opportunities and serve the purpose of fostering commu-
nication between established managers and junior employees on 
questions of cultural change. The establishment of a men-
tor-mentee tandem relationship, dialog events with members of 
the Board of Management and analysis and feedback meetings 
are therefore important program elements. During the current 
2021/2022 round, 31 people are participating in the program.
In order to achieve a sustainable increase in the proportion of 
women in management, work was done on the further integra-
tion of diversity and gender equality in HR processes in key  
thematic areas. This includes the expansion of job sharing at 
Volkswagen AG and an impat program aimed at top talent of 
non-German origin and both genders, who take on responsibility 
at the first level of management at the Group’s head office. This 
ensures greater visibility of international managers, leverages 
their expertise and promotes Group-wide networking. 
The Volkswagen Group actively participates in the “Target  
Gender Equality” program, which was set up by the UN Global 
Compact and targets increased gender equality. The program is 
based on the “UN Women’s Empowerment Principles”, which 
provide all companies with guidance on how they can promote 
the empowerment of women and gender equality in the work-
place, in business and in society. The program is also accompa-
nied by workshops each focusing on different issues, such as the 
gender pay gap, cross-sector peer-to-peer learning processes and 
multi-stakeholder dialogs. This is intended to help companies 
achieve their gender equality goals and increase the proportion 
of women in leadership positions. 
Volkswagen in Argentina has already launched an action plan 
aimed at strengthening gender equality in working life, which  
is to be implemented using the UN Women’s Empowerment Prin-
ciples. The focus is on a better work/life balance as a result of 
flexible working time models and equal opportunities for female 
managers.  
WORK/LIFE BALANCE 
Volkswagen has recognized its employees’ need to be able to re-
spond flexibly and at short notice in various life situations. We 
are therefore constantly working on improving our employees’ 
work/life balance through flexible working time models. For ex-
ample, we want not only to take into account the specific needs 
of parents, single parents or employees who are also carers of 
relatives but to facilitate needs-based and individual flexibility 
for all employees. The rules and programs here vary from coun-
try to country and are determined by the legal framework, cul-
tural circumstances and the results of collective negotiations. 
For example, Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Financial Services 
AG have introduced a new instrument with “Meine AusZeit”, 
through which employees can take a career break at short notice 
and flexibly without saving time credits beforehand. In the  
leave of three to six months, remuneration continues to be paid,  
financed by advance payment by the employer. This is repaid in 
the sub sequent period of work immediately after the leave.
In addition, we are working on meeting the need many employ-
ees have for more flexibility in their working hours and place of 
work. Volkswagen AG, Audi, Porsche, SEAT and Bugatti have con-
cluded far-reaching company agreements regarding working 
outside company premises (mobile working). It has become  
apparent that many employees also want to continue to work  
remotely to a greater extent after the pandemic. Volkswagen AG 
has therefore updated the existing 2021 rules. The rules will en-
ter into force after the normalization of the COVID-19 situation 
and increase flexibility in the structuring of working hours.
Our guarantee of reemployment also offers a high level of flexi-
bility. For the past 20 years or so, Volkswagen AG employees have 
been able to take up to eight years’ leave of absence without hav-
ing to give a reason. Regardless of whether this leave is for career 
development purposes or for parental leave, employees have a 
guaranteed right to re-employment on the same terms and con-
ditions as before. 
In particular, we help our employees to care for and look after 
close relatives. Employees can take up to ten days’ leave at short 
notice in order to organize care for sick relatives, for instance. 
Employees can take up to six months’ leave or reduce their work-
ing hours for the same period in order to care for a relative. Em-
ployees can work part-time for up to 24 months in order to care 
for their families in accordance with the statutory entitlement 
in Germany. 
For certain groups of employees at Volkswagen AG and Audi, 
there is an annual option: a conversion to paid leave may  
be made in place of payment of additional remuneration in  
accordance with the collective agreement.

In Germany, the large number of people who take advantage of 
their statutory parental leave entitlement proves how many  
employees wish for reconcilability of work and family life. For 
parents, we grant additional benefits that go beyond statutory 
entitlements. Thus, to ensure they remain mobile when on  
parental leave, Volkswagen AG employees that are entitled to 
company cars may continue using their vehicles privately. 
Volkswagen AG and subsidiaries with corresponding rules grant 
their employees a benefit provision in the employer-financed  
occupational pension plan (basic plan) during parental leave. 
We also consider childcare during working hours highly im-
portant for enabling work/life balance for our employees. The 
Volkswagen Group therefore endeavors to offer childcare geared 
to specific groups of people. Additionally, we provide daycare 
centers near a number of our sites. 
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION
At Volkswagen, we have a clear stance when it comes to discrimi-
nation: we reject it, because we stand for respect, for equal  
opportunities, for working together and for equal treatment of 
people, irrespective of their ethnicity, race, gender, disability, 
ideology, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, social back-
ground or political beliefs, provided the latter are based on  
democratic principles and tolerance towards those who hold dif-
ferent views. The Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct provides 
guidance throughout the Group and we sanction any breaches of 
the rules set out in it. Under the code, every employee and man-
ager is responsible for ensuring that colleagues work together in 
partnership and for taking action if rules are breached. We also 
keep central statistics on this: in 2021, 15 Volkswagen Group em-
ployees were dismissed due to breaches in the area of discrimi-
nation, harassment or stalking.1 
INCLUSION AT THE WORKPLACE 
However, our understanding of diversity extends beyond gen-
der equality, sexual orientation and internationality. For exam-
ple, we also focus on the inclusion and integration of employees 
with disabilities. We take account of our social responsibility by 
supporting workshops for people with disabilities. To this end, 
we awarded contracts worth around € 12.4 million  in various 
Group companies during 2021. But we also champion the inclu-
sion of people with disabilities internally. On an international 
level, we operate five protected workshops and are setting up ad-
ditional workstations for more than 120 people with disabilities 
at the ŠKODA production sites in the Czech Republic. In 2021, 
the proportion of employees with disabilities at Volkswagen AG 
was 8.7%
Our responsibility for keeping employees in valuable activities 
for their entire career if possible also extends to the needs of em-
ployees with a restricted working capacity. After all, individual 
forms of work organization can result in significantly higher 
performance and job satisfaction levels for precisely these 
groups of employees. The Work2Work program provides a good 
example. Since 2001, Volkswagen AG has opened up new career 
opportunities within the business for employees with differing 
abilities. In Wolfsburg, around 700 employees are currently em-
ployed in Work2Work jobs in more than 50 different areas.

INTEGRITY
INTEGRITY AS THE FOUNDATION OF SUCCESS
Acting with integrity and in compliance with the rules are of key 
importance for the success and resilience of our Group. This is 
why we have made integrity and compliance a key element of 
our NEW AUTO Group strategy and chosen them as one of six  
focus topics of our sustainability program. Our objective is to act 
as a role model in this area and thus deepen the trust of existing 
and future employees, customers, shareholders and partners. We 
have set out the ethical basis of our actions in our Code of Conduct 
and in the Group Essentials.
The aim is to gear our rules, processes and corporate culture to 
enabling every employee to act with integrity and in compli-
ance with the rules at all times. At the same time, we want to en-
sure that integrity and compliance permanently have the same 
strategic and operational priority as, for example, sales revenue, 
profit, product quality or employer attractiveness. 
Our Understanding of Integrity
For us, integrity means doing the right thing in a professional 
context on the basis of our own convictions. This includes 
steadfastness in adhering to these principles – regardless of eco-
nomic or social pressures. Integrity is an attitude. It provides an 
inner compass for correct action. This becomes crucial in gray 
areas where there are no explicit (compliance) rules or conflict-
ing goals exist. 
In addition to personal integrity, organizational integrity mat-
ters to us too. It is based on anchoring integrity in the Group’s 
processes and decisions and offers people a fixed framework for 
interaction. In a third dimension, we understand integrity as an 
intangible corporate asset: it strengthens our stakeholders’ trust 
and makes us more attractive for investors, customers and 
employees. 
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE
Integrity and compliance (I&C) should form the core of our 
business activities, including in our transformation from a  
vehicle manufacturer to a provider of sustainable mobility.  
We set binding standards for this in all areas. 
For example, every proposed resolution submitted to the Group 
Board of Management must demonstrate that it is in line with 
integrity and compliance requirements and state which relevant 
risks the targeted resolution includes and how the risks can be 
reduced. This I&C statement is also binding for decisions of the 
boards of management of the individual Group brands and com-
panies and for bodies to which the board of management in 
question has delegated decision-making powers. The I&C state-
ment is thus anchored in the proposed resolutions of the Group’s 
and the brands’ top bodies.
As the highest Group body, the Integrity and Compliance Group 
Board of Management Committee (K-VAC) deals with the design 
and guiding principles of the integrity and compliance manage-
ment system.  It is overseen by the Group Board of Management 
Integrity and Legal Affairs function. The committee includes the 
members of the Group Board of Management responsible for hu-
man resources, finance and IT and other members of the boards 
of management and top management of the brands. K-VAC analyzes 
the design of the respective compliance management systems 
for each risk area and harmonizes the intervening processes. It 
reviews reports from the brands and regions on integrity, com-
pliance and the T4I initiatives, strategically develops the program 
and monitors the implementation of the recommendations 
made in the Monitorship. 
In particular, the structures and processes changed in the context 
of the Monitorship have proven to be an important foundation 
for our Group. At the same time, they are a task for the future. The 
boards of management of Volkswagen AG, AUDI AG, Volkswagen 
Group of America, Inc. and Volkswagen Group of America Chatta-
nooga Operations LLC in particular have committed to continuing 
on the course adopted and to further promote compliance and  
integrity in the Group on a permanent basis. An independent au-
ditor is also monitoring the change in our Group. He was appointed 
on the basis of an administrative agreement with the U.S. 
Environ mental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA auditorship will 
run until August 2022.
Together4Integrity: Umbrella for  
Integrity and Compliance 
We are implementing the Together4Integrity (T4I) program to 
anchor integrity and compliance measures across the Group. It 
combines the vast majority of the Group’s integrity and compli-
ance activities under a single umbrella, applying uniform, robust 
process and implementation standards. The program not only 
establishes a worldwide integrity and compliance management 
system for all Group and brand companies but also advances one 
of the most extensive change and cultural programs in the history 
of the Volkswagen Group. The T4I program also refers to the 
package of measures of the internal compliance risk assessment 
(ICRA) for implementing the compliance management system 
across the Group.
T4I Bundles the Activities in Eleven Key Initiatives 
T4I will be rolled out in the Volkswagen Group by 2022 and im-
plemented by 2025. The Integrity and Legal Affairs function of 
the Board of Management has responsibility for it. Under the T4I 
umbrella, uniform Group standards are defined for a total of 16 
departments, including not only integrity management and 
compliance but also risk management, human resources, pro-
curement and production. T4I is rolling out these standards in 
the form of more than 100 packages of measures and monitoring 
their implementation as part of effectiveness assurance. 
86
I N T E G R I T Y
The packages of measures are grouped in 11 key initiatives: 
1)  HR compliance policies and procedures: The core topic is the 
integration of integrity and compliance into standard HR  
processes such as recruitment, training, promotion and remu-
neration (granting bonuses). Integrity and compliance are also 
a compulsory topic in annual employee appraisals and form 
part of training measures for employees across various hierarchy 
levels. Volkswagen AG and other defined companies addition-
ally keep anonymized statistics on misconduct and the  
resulting sanctions. These are regularly communicated to 
employees.
2)  Code of Conduct: The Volkswagen Group’s Code of Conduct 
(CoC) serves as the key element for reinforcing awareness of 
responsible conduct and decision-making within the work-
force, giving employees support and guidance, and finding the 
right contact persons in cases of doubt. This creates the basis 
for compliance with the rules within the Company. The CoC is 
a component of the Group’s employment contracts and is 
mandatory for all the Group’s employees. It is also addressed 
in annual employee appraisals based on the criterion of  
“living integrity”. In the reporting year, as scheduled, the 
Volkswagen Group reviewed its Code of Conduct for funda-
mental, previously unaddressed compliance risks and for 
whether it was up to date. No fundamental risks were identified.
3)  Integrity program: The integrity program aims to anchor in-
tegrity as a strategic lever and a control variable for decision- 
making processes in all the brands and companies and con-
tribute to strengthening the culture of integrity. The most  
important instruments in this program include dialog-oriented 
communication measures and event formats. The aim is to 
communicate the key importance of integrity to employees, to 
make integrity visible and tangible in day-to-day work and to 
support employees in acting with integrity in their day-to-day 
work. Employees from various parts of the company who want 
to advance the topic due to their own personal motivation – 
so-called integrity ambassadors – carry the topic into the 
structures of the company and aim to promote lively discussion 
in this way. 
 
One focus of the program is training for the ability to make  
decisions with integrity. Specific training modules for all levels 
of management (including foremen) have been developed for 
this. Since the end of the reporting year, these have been inte-
grated into all Volkswagen AG’s obligatory management training 
programs. The brands and companies that do not use these 
programs are required to include corresponding modules in 
their own development programs for managers. 
 
An additional initiative in the reporting year aimed to further 
empower employees and managers to demonstrate integrity by 
exercising their decision-making leeway, thinking entrepre-
neurially and acting in a solution-oriented manner and thereby 
advance the transformation of the Group from a cultural per-
spective as well.
4)  Risk management and internal control processes: Our busi-
ness activities entail risks. Binding structures and processes 
are intended to create transparency and help manage risk. 
These include the quarterly risk process, which is focused on 
acute risks, the standard internal control system (ICS), which is 
intended to protect key processes, business continuity man-
agement, which identifies business-critical processes and pro-
tects them with contingency plans, and root cause analysis.
5)  Internal compliance risk assessment (ICRA) and compliance 
organization: The ICRA determines the compliance risks in the 
Group. Based on their risk profile, measures are defined for 
each company and their implementation is tracked. The com-
pliance risks particularly address corruption, money launder-
ing, embezzlement and business and human rights risks. The 
ICRA also defines implementation standards for the Code of 
Conduct, whistleblower system and compliance training. The 
Group Chief Compliance Officer reports to the K-VAC on a reg-
ular basis, but at least annually, on the implementation status 
of the measures. In the reporting year, the risk assessment was 
revised, the topic of business and human rights was integrated 
and the risk exposure of 782 companies was reassessed. The 
catalog of measures was also revised and updated. 
6)  Whistleblower system: The whistleblower system is the cen-
tral point of contact for reporting cases of rule-breaking by 
Group employees, such as white collar crimes, acts of corrup-
tion, tax offenses, environmental offenses, human rights  
violations, infringements of antitrust and competition legis-
lation, money laundering and terrorism financing, breaches 
of product safety and licensing regulations, and serious 
breaches of privacy. 
7)  M&A and NCS compliance: Where mergers & acquisitions 
transactions (M&A) requiring the involvement of the Compli-
ance team are planned, the relevant companies and transac-
tions are audited in respect of white collar crime risks, like  
corruption, embezzlement or fraud, for instance as part of a 
due diligence audit. Based on this, the business units are given 
recommendations for measures to reduce the risks identified. 
This also applies to joint ventures and industrialization projects, 
such as the construction of new foreign production sites with 
external partners, and is now binding for cooperation projects 
with external partners. Furthermore, Group Compliance deals 
with compliance management at noncontrolled shareholdings 
(NCSs), i.e. companies that are not controlled by a Volkswagen 
Group company as a majority shareholder. This also applies to 
Chinese joint ventures. Strategic, economic and ethical deci-
sion-making parameters are essential for the sustainability of 
investment decisions in M&A transactions and when support-
ing NCS.

I N T E G R I T Y
8)  Business partner due diligence: In the business partner due 
diligence (BPDD) process, the integrity, and especially the cor-
ruption risks, of business partners and suppliers are reviewed. 
The process comprises an audit, and further, the constant 
monitoring of the business partners in respect of compliance 
with laws and ethical standards. 
9)  Product compliance: The product compliance management 
system (PCMS) supports our products in meeting the statutory 
and regulatory requirements of the exporting and importing 
countries, internal and external standards, contractually 
agreed customer requirements and externally communicated 
commitments over their entire service life. The PCMS defines 
roles and responsibilities for design, implementation and mon-
itoring. We train employees and managers on product compli-
ance and have central points of contact to which our employees 
can address their questions.
10)  Environmental compliance: The Group’s environmental policy 
and the environmental compliance management system 
(ECMS) stipulate that environmentally relevant aspects and 
requirements must be taken into account in all strategy, plan-
ning and decision-making processes of the brands and Group 
companies. This includes a KPI system that measures prog-
ress on the achievement of environmental targets. In addition 
to actual environmental risks, we take potential environmental 
risks into account as well. We also extrapolate opportunities 
that arise for our business model from changes in environ-
mental conditions and regulations. In addition, we prepare 
for dangerous situations in order to protect employees, cus-
tomers, society and the environment. Our employees receive 
training on climate and environmental requirements to im-
prove awareness of these topics.
11)  Anti-corruption program: The Volkswagen Group has a zero- 
tolerance policy on active or passive corruption. This is an-
chored in both the Code of Conduct for Employees and in the 
Code of Conduct for Business Partners. Further Group policies 
set out how to deal with conflicts of interest, gifts, invitations, 
donations and sponsorship. In addition, there are operating 
guidelines addressing approval procedures and record-keep-
ing. Reported breaches of the code are pursued and processed 
by our investigation offices, and sanctions are imposed on the 
employees concerned.
The T4I Program’s Implementation Status 
For each key initiative, including associated measures, there is a 
responsible department at Group level. This department deter-
mines the design of the measures from the perspective of content 
and advises the brands and companies during implementation.  
A consistent, structured plan supports uniform implementation. 
By 2025, T4I will be implemented in around 850 Group companies. 
The T4I toolbox forms the basis for the implementation of the 
key initiatives that have not already been implemented through 
their own organization structures and management systems –  
for example, the compliance management system. The toolbox 
contains all the specific deliverables that each Group or brand 
company needs to achieve within agreed timing and milestone 
planning. 
In the 2021 reporting year, T4I was rolled out in another 95 com-
panies. A total of 707 companies had thus started implementation 
by the end of the reporting year. These companies together employ 
more than 90% of all employees in companies majority-owned 
by the Volkswagen Group.
The managing directors of the relevant company are responsible 
for successful implementation in the companies. Local adaptation 
and implementation status of individual measures may differ 
from entity to entity. The implementation time will also vary.  
In order to safeguard implementation quality in the individual 
companies, independent effectiveness assurance testing has 
been established since the end of 2020. As part of the effective-
ness assurance testing, content and processes of the 11 key ini-
tiatives regarding design and operational effectiveness derived 
from the U.S. Monitorship will be reviewed for their sustainability 
anchoring; implementation of the minimum requirements by 
the T4I program will also be reviewed on the basis of a risk-based 
testing approach.
CULTURE CHANGE: INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE 
T4I not only aims to strengthen uniform corporate governance 
on integrity and compliance across the Group, the program also 
wants to further develop the culture of integrity. T4I is intended 
to inspire and motivate employees and strengthen their own  
incentive to act with integrity in all situations. Communication 
plays a key role here. This is how our senior executives regularly 
spell out in their “Tones from the top” format how important  
integrity and compliance are for both the company and every 
single employee. 
Volkswagen’s corporate culture is founded on the seven Group 
Essentials.  They define how we want to work together and thus 
supplement the Code of Conduct. The Group Essentials also form 
the frame of reference for the role model program, in which 
managers are to be equipped to set an example of an open dis-
cussion culture and contribute to allowing questions, risks or 
conflicting targets to be discussed without fear of sanctions. 
As part of T4I, we want to inspire and motivate employees, par-
ticularly through launch events and perception workshops. 
These events form part of every local T4I implementation strategy. 
They involve representatively selected employees and managers 
across hierarchies as players in the change process. This should 
increase awareness of each individual’s valuable contribution. 
There is also an opportunity to ask questions, name problems 
and discuss solutions. The events focus on the everyday practice 
of integrity and compliance, in relation to employee perception. 
GRI 102-11
88
I N T E G R I T Y
Since the start of the T4I program in 2018, 573 events have been 
initiated at 634 companies, of which 115 were recurring percep-
tion workshops. More than 33,500 managers and employees have 
already taken part. By repeating the events, it is possible to mea-
sure the progress of the company in question. Discussions can 
thus be deepened and awareness of the importance of the 
change process can be strengthened. This has enabled us to 
make further progress: more than 80% of those surveyed saw the 
anchoring of I&C as part of the T4I program in the companies as 
progressing successfully. This represents a further increase com-
pared with the previous year (78%) and a significant increase 
compared with the first measurement point in 2019 (71%).
Further Increasing the Measurability of Integrity
Methods of monitoring impact and measuring progress are an 
integral part of the Volkswagen Group’s integrity and compli-
ance management system. For example, the central planning 
and reporting system of the T4I program provides continuous 
transparency on the implementation status of the key initia-
tives. This serves both internal Board of Management reporting 
and effective project management.
In addition to the recurring perception workshops, the annual 
employee survey – the Opinion Survey – in particular provides 
information about the progress of our culture of integrity. The 
Group-wide survey includes a question on whether it is possible 
for each individual to act with integrity. If employees have any 
doubts about this, the relevant manager needs to identify and 
clear possible obstacles together with their team. The question 
was first asked in the Opinion Survey in 2017 and since then, in-
cluding in the reporting period, has been one of the three ques-
tions with the highest level of agreement in the Volkswagen 
Group – and the level of agreement has been improving.
In addition, an integrity and compliance survey was run for the 
first time in the reporting year, and more than 47,000 employees 
anonymously and voluntarily took part in it. Based on the overall 
approval rate of 86%, the result shows there is great personal will-
ingness to take responsibility among employees. They know how 
important integrity and compliance are, know the negative con-
sequences of misconduct and are willing to report such conduct. 
In addition, the majority emphasize that there is room for open 
discussion and constructive criticism. However, the survey also 
shows the differences between the departments, brands and com-
panies. The action areas identified are now being dealt with. The 
survey will be repeated in 2023.
The brands that manufacture passenger cars use the “compli-
ance, culture of dealing openly with mistakes and acting with in-
tegrity” strategic indicator as an additional metric. This is also 
based on the Opinion Survey and asks about compliance with 
regulations and processes, dealing with risks and errors, and 
whether it is possible to act with integrity. The key performance 
indicator has continuously improved through to 2021 from an 
already good starting point: since compilation of this indicator 
began, employee agreement has always been in the highest 
category of the underlying five-point scale. Compared to the 
baseline value, the index rose by 4.1 points, as against a rise in 
the previous year of 0.2 points. We also use the integrity index. It 
measures the Group’s integrity and functions as a structural ear-
ly warning system. The index was started in 2019 as a pilot project 
for the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi brands. Independent 
business ethicists collect more than 100 measuring points in the 
categories of compliance & infrastructure, working atmosphere 
& integrity culture, products & customers, society, and partners 
& markets. The assessments conducted in the reporting year 
show an index improvement both at Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
Germany and at Audi Germany. Gains at both brands in the cate-
gories of compliance & infrastructure, working atmosphere & 
integrity culture, products & customers and society contribut-
ed to this.
COMPLIANCE: CLEAR RULES 
IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP
Sustainable economic success can only be achieved if each indi-
vidual complies with laws, internal regulations and voluntary 
commitments. Compliant behavior should be a matter of course 
for all Group employees. The compliance organization provides 
support through programs, guidelines for action, processes and 
practical advice in the Group-wide compliance management sys-
tem. All compliance measures to be implemented in the compa-
nies are set by Group Compliance on the basis of internal risk as-
sessment and defined through a standardized catalog of 
measures (see ICRA, KI5, p. 86). 
In light of the transformation the Group is currently undergoing 
and international legislative initiatives – including on whistle-
blower systems and supply chains – the Compliance department 
constantly updates and monitors its own objectives and imple-
mentation in the companies. Group Compliance worked on  
additional focus points and future-oriented action areas in the 
reporting year with an action package of 13 initiatives. These  
included projects for cross-Group cooperation in the markets, 
further development of IT-based compliance tools and exchange 
formats with internal and external compliance experts.
Compliance Organization established  
across the Group
The Group Chief Compliance Officer heads the global compliance 
organization. They report directly to the member of the Board of 
Management for Integrity and Legal Affairs and to the Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG. The 
compliance organization is structured by division, which is  
intended to strengthen communication and enable harmonized 
processes across all relevant Group companies.
The divisional compliance officers are generally responsible for 
several brands and implement compliance measures in their area 
of responsibility. One exception is Porsche AG; the Divisional  
Compliance Officer there is only responsible for one brand.  
One regional compliance officer is responsible for the activities 
89
I N T E G R I T Y
of the Volkswagen-controlled entities in China. In the reporting 
year, Group Compliance appointed an additional regional com-
pliance officer for the Asia region. The officer’s area of responsi-
bility covers entities in, for example, Korea, Malaysia and Japan.
Group Compliance helps the respective Group and brand compa-
nies to carry out their business activities in compliance with the 
rules and comply with the relevant laws and internal regulations. 
Focuses include anti-corruption, preventing embezzlement,  
preventing money laundering, and business and human rights. 
In addition, compliance must be bindingly included in M&A 
transactions. Furthermore, Group Legal is conducting correspond-
ing risk assessments in relevant company units and Group com-
panies on antitrust and anti-competitive risks.
Clear Standards for Business Partners 
Group Compliance supports the entities with operational  
responsibility (first line) in conducting business partner due dili-
gence. The aim is to identify risks for breaches of the law such as 
corruption and disregard of ethical standards at an early stage, 
avoid high-risk business partners and define measures to mini-
mize risk and implement these with business partners. If this is 
not possible, the business relationship will be terminated or not 
commenced in the first place. The business partner in question 
may be blacklisted from doing business with the Volkswagen 
Group and blocked from all its brands and companies. The BPDD 
process is conducted in cooperation with the commissioning  
department, for example Procurement or Sales. More than 8,600 
BPDD reviews were carried out in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, 
we had identified around 400 cases that led to terminating or not 
commencing business relationships. 
Integration of the Topic of Business and Human Rights
The Volkswagen Group has integrated the topic of business and 
human rights into the compliance management system and  
given this area of responsibility key strategic importance. The 
compliance management system for business and human rights 
(CMS BHR) is geared to the UN’s requirements and specifications 
regarding business and human rights due diligence. 
Continuous Improvement
Internal and external auditors regularly scrutinize the compli-
ance management system. Particularly in the context of the 
monitoring and improvement process, external auditors regu-
larly audit the effectiveness of the compliance measures in the 
Group on the basis of risk. In addition, continuous improvement 
processes support the development of the compliance manage-
ment system. This system also has Group-wide hot-topic report-
ing, which serves to rapidly process compliance incidents.
Extensive Compliance and Anti-Corruption Training 
Across the Group, all employees are required to complete regular 
Code of Conduct training (CoC training) in accordance with uni-
form standards. The content is updated every two years and 
made available to the brands and companies. The last update was 
in the reporting year, including on the topics of business and  
human rights, environmental compliance, product conformity 
and product safety, and occupational safety. Employees who  
underwent their mandatory Code of Conduct training in the  
reporting year after the training update either for the first time 
or as part of the regular repeat cycle have therefore been trained 
in these topics.
Employees have to complete the training and final test in the 
form of a web-based training (WBT) and repeat it every two 
years. Passing is documented in their training history. Interns, 
student workers and doctoral candidates are excluded from the 
training for technical and process reasons. Production employ-
ees regularly receive mandatory Code of Conduct training from 
their direct managers. This is repeated every four years. Mem-
bers of the higher levels of management are annually certified 
on the CoC. They confirm that they will comply with the require-
ments and undertake to report any serious regulatory violations. 
Not only are internal staff made aware of and trained on the CoC, 
business partners from sales and procurement are also made 
aware of and trained on it on a risk-based basis. The basis for this 
is the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, which has been a 
component of the agreements with suppliers and service providers 
since 2020. The focus of the training is on combating corruption.
Volkswagen AG systematically records the number of permanent 
staff (employees and management, including full-time and part-
time staff) who have a valid qualification for the mandatory 
Code of Conduct web-based training. In Volkswagen AG, 48,017 
employees in the relevant target group had a valid Code of Con-
duct qualification as of the end of December 2021. This equates 
to 98.2% of the permanent workforce (employees and manage-
ment) in Volkswagen AG who need to be qualified with the web-
based training on the Code of Conduct.
In addition, Group Compliance develops and implements tar-
get-group-specific training for employees in areas or companies 
with high risk exposure. Anti-corruption training with an  
in-depth module on dealing with officeholders and mandate 
holders is mandatory for white-collar employees. Companies 
with high risk exposure must implement this training in a  
mandatory way. Volkswagen AG systematically records the num-
ber of permanent staff subject to mandatory qualification who 
have a valid qualification for the mandatory web-based training 
on the topic of anti-corruption. In Volkswagen AG, 36,565 em-
ployees in the relevant target group had a valid anti-corruption 
qualification as of December 31, 2021. This equates to 74.8% of 
the permanent workforce (employees and management) in 
Volkswagen AG who need to be qualified with the web-based 
training on the topic of anti-corruption, including full-time and 
part-time employees. The periodic update of the training and the 
associated repeat cycle in the reporting year led to a reduction in 
the rate compared with the previous year. The rate is expected to 
increase again next year once the repeat qualification cycle has 
been completed. Group Legal also continuously provides antitrust 
training on a risk-based basis, and the Group Board of Manage-
ment is also trained on its content. 
90
I N T E G R I T Y
Training for employees who are employed to key positions in 
companies with high risk exposure – for example, as a managing  
director or a financial officer – was continued in the reporting 
year. This training is implemented across the Group by the  
respective companies’ compliance and personnel managers.
In addition to the aforementioned training, Volkswagen AG’s 
compliance departments offer target-group-specific training for-
mats and communication formats, including management dis-
cussions and training courses for disseminators of information. 
Moreover, compliance content is an established component of all 
career development paths, from the trainee induction program 
through programs for leadership and management development 
to the senior management program. The measures are supple-
mented by information and communication activities such as 
awareness campaigns, film and dialog formats, newsletters and 
interactive games. Based on risk, the Compliance department 
regularly addresses employees that are exposed to particular 
compliance risks due to their role or their area of work, e.g. in 
Sales or Procurement. 
Communication and Advice: Options for Employees 
The compliance information point has been established as the 
central advisory office for compliance matters within the 
Volkswagen Group. The team gives a direct recommendation on 
the situation or passes the question on to a competent body.  
Dialog events in the departments supplement the advice offered. 
Tasks and example cases from the advisory work are regularly 
included in compliance communication.
In the reporting year, the information point handled 1,335 in-
quiries (previous year: 1,482, in each case Volkswagen AG). The 
contact options have been further expanded. Employees can 
now directly contact the information point in the Volkswagen 
360° app. This mainly benefits employees who do not have their 
own computer connection in the office. 
The content of the continuous compliance communication in-
cludes the prevention of corruption, conduct in the event of con-
flicts of interest and correctly dealing with officeholders and 
mandate holders. The practical “Anti-corruption” guidelines can 
be accessed at any time. Employees and managers’ awareness of 
the issue is regularly raised with information documents, docu-
mentation, films, example cases and extensive communication. 
Risk Prevention through the Whistleblower System
The whistleblower system is intended to avert damage to the 
Group, the workforce and other stakeholders with binding prin-
ciples and clearly regulated procedures. Employees, business 
partners and their employees, customers and other third parties 
can report information on potential breaches of the rules at any 
time and in any language – including anonymously if they so 
choose. The whistleblower system offers six different reporting 
channels for this, which each enable a report to be made anony-
mously if desired. These include an online reporting channel, 
through which information is accepted in all languages. This 
online channel allows whistleblowers to set up a protected mail-
box in the system through which messages can be exchanged 
with the Central Investigation Office, Audi Investigation Office or 
Traton Investigation Office including anonymously, for the pur-
pose of processing the whistleblower information – for example, 
in the event of further questions. Here, anonymity is additionally 
ensured through special technical protection. In other words, in 
addition to a voluntary commitment by the Group, it is not pos-
sible, for example, to identify the source of the information due 
to the IT infrastructure used. The other channels include an  
international 24-hour telephone hotline, through which infor-
mation can be reported in a total of 16 languages, and external 
attorneys, who are available as ombudsmen. 
The Volkswagen Group assures all whistleblowers and people 
who support the whistleblowers or the investigations of protec-
tion from any reprisals they could experience due to their reports 
and their efforts to investigate breaches. This is anchored in a 
Group policy that applies worldwide and described in the Code of 
Conduct. The terms stated in the Group policy show that the 
Volkswagen Group complies with the provisions of international 
whistleblower protection laws. Breaches of the ban on discrimi-
nation are treated as serious breaches of the rules. 
Strict confidentiality and secrecy apply throughout the investiga-
tion process. An investigation is only initiated after a thorough re-
view and in the event of concrete indications of rule-breaking. The 
presumption of innocence is applied to those concerned. Their 
response is heard as soon as possible, and, if necessary, their 
names are cleared if they have been wrongly accused. Sanctions 
are applied where misconduct is proven. This can comprise a 
warning, a reprimand or termination. Following serious breach-
es of rules to which sanctions are applied, structured root cause 
analyses are conducted and, if necessary, measures to be taken 
are determined in order to prevent similar incidents in the 
future.
The task and functioning of the whistleblower system are ad-
dressed in the compliance trainings. In addition, in-depth train-
ing has been introduced for those target groups that may come 
into contact with serious breaches of rules due to their work – 
e.g. employees of the audit functions or in security, human  
resources, legal or compliance departments. In addition, the 
whistleblower system is regularly part of the compliance com-
munication – for example, in articles, sharing best practice, ex-
ample cases, dialog events or film and audio contributions. 
The whistleblower system is coordinated by the Central Investi-
gation Office in Wolfsburg. The employees there are processing 
whistleblower information concerning Volkswagen AG and its 
subsidiaries. They also process whistleblower information  
relevant to the Volkswagen Group. 
In the event of the investigation of an operational case, the  
investigation office is supported by Group Internal Audit, Group 
Security and Group Legal. The experience and expertise 
91
I N T E G R I T Y
necessary and relevant for this are available in the departments 
in question. The aim is to ensure the investigation of an opera-
tional case as well as possible with internal resources. In addi-
tion, the investigation office can also arrange for an investiga-
tion by independent and external third parties, such as law firms 
or auditors. This may occur especially when the accusations con-
cern members of the Group Board of Management or the cases are 
exceptionally complex legally – particularly with imminent legal 
impacts (e.g. in the event of particularly serious corruption or 
possible breaches of antitrust and anti-competitive law). In addi-
tion, this approach may be used in cases that include very high 
risk potential for the Volkswagen Group.
AUDI AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG and TRATON SE each have 
separate investigation offices for themselves and their subsidiaries. 
There is also a regional investigation office at Volkswagen (China) 
Investment Company Ltd. This processes whistleblower informa-
tion concerning Volkswagen AG’s Chinese subsidiaries. Coopera-
tion between the investigation offices and uniform processing of 
whistleblower information are centrally monitored and coordi-
nated in Wolfsburg. 
An IT system, internal controls and multiple-party verification 
support the processing of suspicious activity reports. Reports on 
the use of the whistleblower system are also made to the Board 
of Management and the Supervisory Board at regular intervals. 
The workforce is also regularly informed about the whistleblower 
system so as to create more transparency and encourage a posi-
tive change in the culture.
In 2021, 3,219 pieces of whistleblower information were regis-
tered with the aforementioned investigation offices (2020: ap-
prox. 2,873). Of this total, around 20% of the whistleblower infor-
mation was reported anonymously, but with the option of 
contacting the whistleblower, and around 10% was reported 
anonymously without the option of making contact. Around 
90% of whistleblowers thus permitted the investigation offices 
to contact them (2020: around 88%).
In 714 cases, the Central Investigation Office accepted an initial 
suspicion of breaches of rules, particularly breaches of the Code 
of Conduct, in several cases also of laws and/or specific internal 
regulations at the same time, with the result that an internal in-
vestigation was initiated. Of these, 205 cases involved potentially 
serious breaches of rules. 
In the reporting year, due to relevant whistleblower information 
the investigation offices investigated individual suspected cases in 
connection with breaches of rules for the avoidance of corruption. 
In ten cases, significant sanctions such as warning notices or 
severance were imposed. In six cases, these sanctions resulted 
from the contravention of rules governing the acceptance of 
gifts as well as governing the avoidance of conflicts of interest in 
contract award decisions. In three cases, employees did not  
comply with rules relating to extending invitations to business 
partners and officials. In one case, so-called facilitation pay-
ments by a service provider to customs officials were tolerated, 
which resulted in one case of employee dismissal.
Eleven investigations due to suspicion of serious breaches of 
rules in relation to antitrust or anti-competitive law were com-
pleted. Of these, the suspicion of a serious breach of the rules 
was confirmed in one case. 
An independent external auditor regularly audits the effective-
ness and functionality of the whistleblower system. The audit  
is currently conducted annually. The Audit Committee of the  
Supervisory Board, the Group Board of Management and the 
boards of management of companies concerned are informed  
of the result and possible suggestions for improvement. 
Volkswagen AG’s Group Compliance department regularly en-
gages in dialog with experts from other companies with the  
digital ComplianceXChange workshop format to discuss various 
approaches and solutions together in interactive talks and 
workshops.
Protection of Customer Data
To meet the requirements of the EU-wide General Data Protec-
tion Regulation, Volkswagen AG has created a data protection 
management system (DPMS) and a data protection management 
organization. The DPMS ensures that the data protection pro-
cesses set up are regularly analyzed, are up to date and are fur-
ther developed. One component of the DPMS is the process for 
reporting data protection violations (reporting process). It is  
connected with Volkswagen AG’s whistleblower system and IT 
Security.
In fiscal year 2021, there were two reportable data protection 
breaches pursuant to Art. 33 EU GDPR in the processing of per-
sonal customer data. In addition, reportable data protection 
breaches outside of the processing of personal customer data 
were also reported to the competent supervisory authority in 
due time.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPLY CHAINS AND BUSINESS
The Volkswagen Group is pursuing a vision of enabling sustainable 
mobility for future generations: we want to live up to our legal,  
social and environmental responsibility not only within our own 
business but also in our supply chains as well. In 2021, the 
Volkswagen Group anchored the focus topic of “Responsibility for 
supply chains and business” in the key Group initiatives. 
Our ambition, which we want to translate into lived corporate 
practice by 2030, is: we are fully and entirely committed to our 
corporate human rights responsibility in our business relation-
ships, in our business units and at our sites. For this reason, we 
are integrating business and human rights in the compliance 
management system.
This ambition results in concrete objectives in the field of hu-
man rights: in our supply chain, we want to avoid ESG-related 
risks, including human rights risks, to achieve a situation where 
85% of our direct business partners obtain an A in our sustain-
ability rating (S rating) by 2025. All other business partners need 
to achieve a B rating and thus at least meet our requirements. 
All entities within the scope of Group Compliance are tasked 
with incorporating business and human rights in their compli-
ance management system by 2023. We will tie suitable measures 
and programs to the achievement of each target and manage 
this by means of KPIs.
RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR GROUP
Politicians and civil society increasingly demand that companies 
respect their duties of human rights due diligence. In numerous 
countries, these demands are leading to legislation. The latest  
example is the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Liefer-
kettensorgfaltspflichten-Gesetz – LkSG), which was passed in July 
2021. At the same time, investors and analysts are subjecting 
corporate actions with regard to human rights duties to a system-
atic and increasingly strict assessment through the use of sus-
tainability ratings. Volkswagen acknowledges its human rights 
due diligence duties and codifies these in the Social Charter.

Acting on the Basis of Firm Values and Principles  
The work in our factories and sales companies around the world 
is based on our principles, such as respect for minorities and 
compliance with labor standards. We continuously assess social 
and labor standards and the human rights risk in the countries 
where we operate. The basis for this is, in particular, the publicly 
available reports of the United Nations and specific analyses and 
indices. We explore critical topics internally and communicate 
about these as needed and on a target-group-specific basis. For ex-
ample, our investor relations website has an area for controversial 
ESG topics. 
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Investor Relations > Corporate 
 
Governance > ESG Controversies
The Volkswagen Group respects international policies and  
conventions, particularly: 
•   The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is  
codified in the International Covenant on Civil and  
Political Rights and in the International Covenant on  
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
•   The Core Labor Standards of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO)
•   The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
•   The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 
•   The principles of the UN Global Compact 
The Volkswagen Group has anchored the topic of business and 
human rights in its processes and policies independently from 
external expectations and legislation. For example, the Group 
and employee representatives have signed the “Declaration by 
the Volkswagen Group on social rights, industrial relations and 
business & human rights” – the Social Charter. This declaration 
provides a binding basis for social and industrial relations within 
the Volkswagen Group. It also serves as a benchmark for shaping 
relationships with suppliers and other business partners. The 
specific expectations regarding suppliers arising from this decla-
ration are defined in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners. 
This Code of Conduct must be recognized by all suppliers prior to 
the commencement of the business relationship.
Focal Points: Business and Human Rights
We have compared the above international human rights frame-
works with our business-specific activities, worked out the aspects 
that are relevant for us and defined these as focal points. These  
“salient business & human rights issues” refer to:
Labor rights 
• Freedom of association and the right to 
 collective bargaining  
• No slavery and trafficking  
• No child labor 
• Good working conditions
Safety 
• No involvement in any unlawful activities 
• Guarantee of people’s safety 
Tolerance 
• Tolerance towards different ideological and  
 religious opinions and respectful expression of them  
• No discrimination 
•  Diversity and protection of disadvantaged, especially 
indigenous groups

Clear Responsibilities Defined
Since 2019, the Volkswagen Group has had a coordinator for the 
business and human rights action area. The coordinator is appoint-
ed by the Group Board of Management and also manages the 
collaboration with the brands and regions. In addition, we have  
established committee structures for steering the topic of business 
and human rights from the Group Board of Management through 
to regional level in the Group’s brands.
Code of Conduct and Group Policies as a Framework for Action
Expectations of our employees and our Group-wide understand-
ing of the observance of universal human rights are also set out 
in our Code of Conduct. The issue of human rights is covered in 
the chapter on “Our responsibilities as a member of society”. 
Our Code of Conduct and additional topic-related Group policies  
apply to all the Volkswagen Group’s employees around the world. 
Employees of the Volkswagen Group’s controlled companies are 
trained to this end as part of the mandatory Code of Conduct 
training. The training on the Code of Conduct was updated in the 
reporting year. As part of this, the training focal points of business 
and human rights, the environmental compliance management 
system, product conformity and product safety, and occupa-
tional safety were further strengthened. Employees who took 
their mandatory Code of Conduct training in the reporting year 
either for the first time or as part of the regular repeat cycle 
have therefore been trained on these topics. 
In addition to the Code of Conduct training, there is also  
in-depth training on business and human rights for business di-
visions with medium risk exposure and interested employees. 
In the reporting year, six of these in-depth training courses were 
held for Volkswagen AG employees. Further information on the 
implementation rates for the Code of Conduct training can be 
found in the “Integrity” chapter. 
 
 Integrity 
Group policies create precise specifications. For example, it was 
stipulated in Group Policy 31 that business and human rights is  
a focal point of the Volkswagen Group’s Compliance department. 
With the revision of the “Participation Management of Non- 
Controlled Participations” Group policy and the adoption of the 
“Conducting Site Projects for Industrialization” Group policy,  
we also procedurally anchored the topic of business and human 
rights in site decisions and M&A projects. 
Compliance Management System for Human Rights
We implement our management approach throughout the Group: 
we have integrated the topic of business and human rights into 
the Group’s established compliance management system.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN …
USE OF THE EXISTING COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS IN DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH UN GUIDELINES
UN Elements of Human Rights Due Diligence. Our controlled 
companies are included using the standardized internal compli-
ance risk management process (ICRA). In the case of noncon-
trolled companies (excluding Chinese joint ventures), an individ-
ual analysis is made with our respective company partners. We 
rely on the cooperation of these partners here.
In the reporting year, the introduction of the set of compliance 
measures on the topic of business & human rights was completed 
in the companies falling within the scope of compliance; the scope 
of compliance covers the Group’s controlled companies that are  
active and have their own staff (see “Internal Compliance Risk  
Assessment (ICRA)” section).
Transparency through human rights risk management
The Volkswagen Group has 120 production sites worldwide, in-
cluding the Chinese joint venture production facilities. These are 
mainly in countries with a medium or high human rights risk. 
Group Compliance made risk assessments for the field of human 
rights for 782 controlled Group companies around the world. 
This means that 100% of our controlled companies within the 
scope of compliance in a total of 82 countries were audited.  
97
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  F O R  S U P P LY  C H A I N S  A N D  B U S I N E S S
This human rights risk assessment is largely based on a correla-
tion of country and business-area risks. The country risks refer-
ence the Maplecroft index, a meta-index that draws on more 
than 30 individual indices of international organizations – for 
example, the UN or the Business & Human Rights Resource Cen-
tre. The specific business-area risks are based on corresponding 
publicly available, relevant, well-known information. 
The completion of this analysis means that we have assessed our 
business units’ gross human-rights risks and can allocate it to 
the low, medium and high categories. This means we are also 
aware of those with a high gross risk. We have had the companies 
audit and confirm the results. These companies were then given 
risk-specific measures to be implemented by the end of 2021. 
This will be audited by the Group from 2022. 
In the next step, the companies with a high gross risk are to be 
assessed in respect of their net risks. To this end, we developed a 
self-assessment questionnaire in the reporting year and tested 
and finalized it in a pilot project. At the same time, starting with 
the publication of the first draft of the Supply Chain Due Dili-
gence Act (LkSG) in the spring of the reporting year, we synchro-
nized the content of the net risk assessment with the require-
ments of the act, which has now been passed. 
Implementing legal requirements for human rights protection
In the last few years, a trend of also regulating the issue of busi-
ness and human rights in national laws has emerged in leading 
economic powers. Volkswagen, as a global business, observes 
such national requirements that put international standards in 
concrete form. One example of this is the UK Modern Slavery 
Act 2015. We publish a corresponding Group statement on this 
on our website annually.
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Policy > Slavery
 
and Human Trafficking Statement 
Since the first draft legislation on the LkSG came into existence, 
we have been addressing the corresponding requirements and 
comparing these with the structures and processes in the 
Volkswagen Group. We welcome the fact that the adoption of  
the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act means a long and important  
debate has reached a conclusion. The Volkswagen Group sup-
ports a binding legal framework that requires companies and 
their suppliers to respect human rights. We also welcome the 
EU’s legislative initiative, particularly the associated level play-
ing field for equal and fair competition conditions at interna-
tional level.
Engaged Dialog with Our Stakeholders 
We provide our workforce with information on business and hu-
man rights over a number of channels. This includes articles in 
internal media and newsletters and internal dialog and Q&A 
events. This is because it is important to us that our employees 
obtain information directly at first hand. We communicate our 
positioning to the public and external stakeholders through in-
terviews with top managers and in media reports. 
In our view, continuous dialog between those involved about 
principles and implementation issues is needed in differentiating 
between the state’s duty to protect human rights and corporate 
human rights responsibility. For businesses, it is often challeng-
ing to obtain concrete and objective information enabling a 
comprehensive assessment of human rights situations. In order 
to achieve further progress, we also seek cooperation with inter-
national organizations. For example, we are continuously in 
written and personal dialog with NGOs and human rights insti-
tutions. In this context, we gave, for example, the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) an insight into our activi-
ties upon request. 
Institutional investors and investment banks also seek dialog with 
us on the topic of business and human rights. The corresponding 
activities are, for example, the subject of the Volkswagen ESG 
Conference. We also publish our standpoint, including on con-
troversial aspects, on the Volkswagen Group’s investor relations 
website. 
Internationally, we continue to be the only carmaker to engage 
in the cross-sector initiative “Global Business Initiative for Busi-
ness and Human Rights” (GBI). 
Furthermore, our involvement with econsense, the sustainability 
association of German business, is key to our activities. In Ger-
many, we also actively participate in the German automotive in-
dustry’s sector dialog in the context of the National Action Plan 
for Business and Human Rights, in which manufacturers, suppliers, 
trade unions, NGOs and the German federal government are in-
volved. Volkswagen AG, Audi and Porsche participate in the three 
working groups of the sector dialog. In its working groups on raw 
materials and on the introduction of overarching complaint 
mechanisms, we are promoting, among other things, the pilot-
ing of a cross-company complaint mechanism.
In the first Volkswagen Business and Human Rights Industry  
Dialog, in June 2021 we sought professional discussion with 
those responsible for the topic from other companies and also  
to share best practices. We plan to continue these events.

RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Due to the complexity of its products, the Volkswagen Group’s 
supply chain is highly complex, globally distributed and subject 
to constant change. It comprises more than 60,000 supplier sites 
around the world in almost 100 countries. In the Sustainable 
Procurement 2025+ strategy, we set the following goals as an 
aspiration: 
1.  Performance: We improve our direct and indirect suppliers’ 
sustainability performance through our activities. 
2.  Partnership: We work together with our suppliers and other 
stakeholders cooperatively, constructively and on an equal 
footing. 
3.  Transparency: We are committed to transparency in our  
activities and supply chains. 
We will only be able to achieve these targets together with our 
suppliers. That is why we pursue systematic and continuous  
development of these suppliers founded on partnership-based 
cooperation. Long-term partnerships with strategic suppliers are 
at the forefront of our activities in purchasing. This is also re-
flected in the key figures by which we want to be measured by 
2025. For example, 85% of direct suppliers (based on revenue) 
will have their awareness of sustainability topics raised and be 
trained on these. We also want to reach a point where 85% of 
suppliers audited (based on revenue) obtain a sustainability  
rating of A. In our own Group, we will train 100% of buyers 
around the world on sustainability topics.
Management Approach with Three Dimensions of Action
We want to live up to our responsibility in our business relation-
ships on a global level and want to act proactively beyond fulfilling 
legal requirements – for example, with regard to decarboniza-
tion or our sustainability rating. In procurement, we follow a 
three-pronged approach. This step requires transparency about 
the supply relationships that go beyond the first tier (tier 1).
•  Prevent: Sustainability requirements are enshrined in con-
tracts and specifications, particularly the Code of Conduct for 
Business Partners. Suppliers’ awareness is raised and they  
receive training.
•  Detect: The sustainability risks in the supply chain are system-
atically detected and prioritized. Sustainability is anchored  
in the material contract award decisions across the Group and  
a rating of potential suppliers’ sustainability performance  
(“S rating”) is used. The basis for this is self-assessment and 
risk-based on-site audits. 
•  React: Various measures are available to react to the risks  
and impacts identified. These include a process for reviewing 
breaches by individual suppliers and action plans derived  
from on-site audits.
Implementation of this management approach is mandatory 
worldwide and is enshrined in corresponding policies for the 
Group’s brands and controlled companies. The Procurement Sus-
tainability Management department conducts the operational 
management. To better bundle skills, the department was directly 
assigned to a division below the member of the Group Board of 
Management responsible for purchasing in a restructuring of pro-
curement during the reporting year. In order to identify current 
developments and long-term challenges in the individual coun-
tries, we also encourage dialog between our brands and regions 
through the Sustainability Procurement Network, in which more 
than 50 experts from five continents work together.
Prevent: requirements for our suppliers
The core element of our supplier management is the 
“Volkswagen requirements for sustainability in relations with 
business partners” – the Code of Conduct for Business Partners”. 
The Code of Conduct is agreed with all the Volkswagen Group’s 
suppliers. It embeds our expectations of our business partners’ 
conduct with respect to key environmental, social and compli-
ance standards in our contractual agreements. The requirements 
are based, among other things, on the OECD Guidelines for Mul-
tinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights and the relevant International Labour Orga-
nization (ILO) conventions. The Code of Conduct is, however, not 
just based on international standards, but also objectives, rules 
and policies of the Volkswagen Group. 
Before submitting a quote, our suppliers must confirm that they 
acknowledge our sustainability requirements in the Code of Con-
duct; this explicit acknowledgment must be repeated after 12 
months have elapsed if they wish to submit new quotes. We also 
call on our tier 1 suppliers to pass our requirements set out in 
the Code of Conduct for Business Partners down along the supply 
chain. The Code of Conduct is currently being revised and further 
requirements arising, for example from the Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act, are being added. We plan to publish the revised 
Code of Conduct in the first quarter of 2022. 
In addition to the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, there 
are additional product-specific requirements for suppliers. These 
are set out in the specifications and stipulate the way in which 
certain products must be manufactured. The guidelines include, 
for example, only manufacturing battery cells with renewable 
energy and cooperating on full supplier disclosure for the cobalt 
supply chain. These requirements are also binding for the suppli-
ers in question.
Detect: systematic detection of sustainability risks 
Our aim is to know and effectively address the material sustain-
ability risks in our supply chain. A sustainability rating (S rat-
ing) was introduced as a key measure for all relevant companies 
and suppliers in 2019, and its implementation was completed by 
the end of 2021. The S rating is used to audit the sustainability 
99
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  F O R  S U P P LY  C H A I N S  A N D  B U S I N E S S
performance of relevant suppliers1 and reveal opportunities for 
continuous improvement. It assesses the environmental perfor-
mance of suppliers and their social sustainability and integrity. 
The S rating is directly relevant to awarding contracts. If a sup-
plier does not meet our requirements for compliance with sus-
tainability standards, it is fundamentally not eligible for the 
award of contracts. There is thus a direct incentive for suppliers 
to improve their sustainability performance.
The check for the S rating takes place via a multistage process. 
In an initial step, the risk exposure is identified from a combi-
nation of country risk and the supplier’s corporate processes 
and policies. A specialist service provider is used for the identi-
fication of the country risk. The Group’s sustainability perfor-
mance is analyzed by means of a standardized questionnaire 
for self-assessment. We developed the “SAQ” questionnaire in  
a joint project with other automotive corporations involved in 
the DRIVE Sustainability Working Group organized by CSR Eu-
rope. The information and documents in the SAQ are checked 
and validated by a service provider via a central platform. If a 
supplier states that it has appropriate processes and policies, it 
must prove this with documents. Minimum requirements were 
drafted for the questionnaire. Every supplier that the S rating 
applies to must meet the requirements enshrined in the ques-
tionnaire in the areas of corporate governance, the environ-
ment, social issues, human rights, compliance and supplier 
management.
A total of more than 15,532 active suppliers submitted a sustain-
ability questionnaire by the end of the reporting period. In the 
reporting period, 6,353 suppliers improved their sustainability 
performance through taking appropriate steps. Based on sales 
revenue, more than 78% of our production suppliers have docu-
mented that they have a certified environmental management 
system in accordance with ISO 14001 and/or EMAS. Our objective 
is for 100% of direct, revenue-generating suppliers with a pro-
duction site and more than 100 employees to have a certified  
environmental management system by 2025. 
Following an initial analysis of the supplier data, in-depth audits 
are carried out on site, based on risk. 654 on-site audits were  
conducted around the world in 2021 (2020: 790). On average, five 
breaches of our sustainability requirements were identified.2 
Clear differences can be seen depending on the region. 
NUMBER OF BREACHES IDENTIFIED WORLDWIDE PER ON-SITE 
AUDIT BY REGION AND IDENTIFIED TOP RISKS BY REGION³ 
In the reporting period, we further developed and used a special 
approach for the on-site check of logistics service providers, 
which, in addition to checking whether environmental criteria 
have been met, in particular also checks observance of 
minimum social standards when deploying driving staff. 
We are also working continuously on avoiding duplication 
when auditing and, to achieve broader coverage of the supply 
chain, are partnering with original equipment manufacturers 
(OEM) and suppliers in a German Association of the Automotive 
Industry (VDA) task force to create a common standard for on-site 
audits. To this end, major Group companies founded the Responsible 
Supply Chain Initiative e. V. in October 2021 together with 11 
additional partners; the initiative plans to share initial audit 
findings next year. The Volkswagen Group supports the continuous 
growth of the initiative with a Board of Management mandate.
By the end of the reporting year, we had 12,483 S ratings for sup-
pliers, accounting for around 85% of total procurement expendi-
ture. Of these suppliers, 3,524 have an A rating, which equates to 
54% of suppliers based on revenue. 91 were rated C and are thus 
not currently eligible for the award of contracts.

React: make improvements on site 
A series of measures are available to react to risks identified in  
the supply chain and concrete breaches by suppliers, and thus to 
actively bring about improvements.
Our supply chain grievance mechanism is an important compo-
nent of sustainable supply chain management. We use it to  
investigate any suspected breaches of our sustainability require-
ments that occur. The corresponding channel is accessible via 
our website, an email address and an anonymized channel and is 
open to anyone potentially affected and stakeholders, e.g. em-
ployees of suppliers, civil society players or representatives of 
communities in the immediate vicinity of our production loca-
tions. The processing of cases is uniformly described in a binding 
policy and is managed by the Group. Cases are processed together 
with the brands and regions of the Volkswagen Group. If violations 
are identified, measures are introduced immediately. If there are 
particularly serious breaches, termination of the business relation-
ship is also possible.
In the reporting period, 111 reports of breaches were dealt with. 
This concerned suppliers where behavior contravening the rules 
or contracts was identified as a result of information provided. 
Collaboration was ended or suppliers were blocked for the award 
of new contracts in the case of four suppliers as a result of activi-
ties by Procurement.

Sustainability Training for Employees and Partners
Systematic training of our employees and suppliers is a central 
component of our strategy and essential for the improvement of 
sustainability in the supply chain. For this purpose we are cur-
rently using two different formats: live online training, as the 
pandemic continues to make in-person training impossible, and 
e-learning courses, which can be accessed and conducted online 
at any time. 
For all Procurement employees, the topic of sustainability is an 
established part of the skills profile. Worldwide, more than 1,900 
Procurement staff were trained in this issue in 2021. Our train-
ing measures continue also to be geared to specific target groups. 
For example, buyers of components associated with higher sus-
tainability risks were given an intensive training program in a 
separate format. Since 2017, we have trained our Procurement 
employees to deal with the special challenges found in battery 
supply chains. In-depth human rights training has been avail-
able since 2020 and was held again in 2021.
To enable continuous supplier development, we usually conduct 
issue-specific sustainability training courses and workshops 
with our suppliers at selected sites. In fiscal year 2020, this was 
not possible due to worldwide restrictions. We therefore devel-
oped an online training option in order to train suppliers on our 
requirements and their implementation in shorter sessions. 
During the reporting period, more than 1,000 participants took 
advantage of this opportunity. As part of the DRIVE Sustainability 
initiative, online training was also provided for suppliers in  
India, Argentina, France and Russia, involving 84 participants. 
In addition to the trainings, we make an e-learning module on sus-
tainability available to current suppliers in the nine languages of 
defined risk countries. By the end of the reporting year, more than 
18,000 suppliers had completed the e-learning course, which 
equates to around 36% of the sales revenue generated by suppliers 
of our procurement expenditure.
Content Focus of Supply Chain Management
For the way we responsibly organize supply chain, the thematic 
focus areas of compliance, decarbonization and human rights 
are an indispensable part of our sustainability activities across 
the entire value creation process in the Volkswagen Group.
We audit the integrity and compliance systems of selected sup-
pliers and service providers through our Business Partner Due 
Diligence (BPDD). This review of existing and potentially new 
business partners is carried out as part of a risk-based, transparent, 
documented process that is implemented worldwide using an  
IT-based tool. Business partners who we have identified as having 
an increased corruption risk due to their business and region are 
also subjected to a more in-depth corruption risk audit. All rele-
vant business partners will then be continuously checked for 
any change in general conditions through a risk and news 
screening. For the period from the start of the process in 2019 to 
December 31, 2021, our database contains 1,513 Business Partner 
Due Diligence audits.
To achieve our climate-protection targets, we also continuously 
develop the procurement processes within the Group’s  
In 2021, more than
 
  1,900 
buyers were trained on 
sustainability globally.

organizational structures and processes. This systematically  
anchors the criterion of CO₂ reduction in the Group’s product 
development processes. In order to encourage measures among 
suppliers, the Group systematically identifies the biggest sources 
of emissions along the supply chain in a component-related way 
by means of life cycle assessments and extends the responsibility 
for the environmental impact of the vehicles to its suppliers 
along the whole value chain. For example, all new suppliers of 
high-voltage batteries are contractually obliged to use certified 
energy from renewable sources in their production. When the 
Group awards new contracts, it now also requires the tier 2 sup-
pliers of relevant intermediate products for battery production 
to exclusively use renewably generated electricity.
Particular Duty of Due Diligence for Human Rights  
in the Supply Chain
As part of our sustainable supplier management measures, we 
pay particular attention to protecting those groups of people 
who, along our supply chain, are at particularly high risk of  
human rights abuses. In order to comply with international 
frameworks and requirements, we piloted a human rights due 
diligence management system in 2021, which we use to system-
atically analyze, prioritize and reduce our supply chain’s human 
rights risks. The management system is based on two process 
steps. First, aggregated assessments are performed for risk analysis 
based on the S rating data. Through this quantitative approach, 
we identify 15 high-risk countries for negative impacts on human 
rights and implement prevention and mitigation measures with 
our brands and regions. To this end, a total of 575 employees of 
suppliers were trained in the implementation of human rights- 
related due diligence in these 15 countries in 2021. In the second 
step, in addition to the data from the S rating, aggregated data 
from our grievance mechanism and information from studies, 
NGO reports and stakeholder conversations are evaluated to  
determine focus activities. In 2021, we prioritized and worked  
on the topics of forced labor, risks in service sectors and the  
revision of our Code of Conduct for Business Partners. 
Raw material due diligence management system 
and reporting
With regard to responsible sourcing of raw materials, the 
Volkswagen Group implements the fifth step of the OECD Due 
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and the re-
quirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk 
Areas. In 2020, we implemented an OECD-oriented raw material 
due diligence management system in the Group. It serves to 
identify, assess and avoid actual and potential human rights 
risks in our upstream raw material supply chains. The risk scope 
of the management system goes beyond Annex 2 of the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Miner-
als from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and currently 
covers 16 particularly high-risk raw materials. These include the 
battery raw materials cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite, the 
conflict minerals tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG), and 
aluminum, copper, leather, mica, steel, natural rubber, platinum 
group metals and rare earths.
With this risk-based approach, we prioritize our activities on the 
basis of the severity and probability of breaches of the law and 
on the basis of the Group’s influence. We also systematically use 
our Group structure for developing and implementing specific 
mitigation measures, whose effectiveness we audit. New report 
structures and toolkits have been developed, and existing tools, 
such as the complaint mechanism, have been integrated in the 
management system. Depending on the results of the due dili-
gence process, the measures are adapted and improved on an  
ongoing basis.
Since 2021 the Volkswagen Group has also reported on the obser-
vation of its human rights due diligence obligations in the raw 
material supply chain – including reporting on the status, prog-
ress and goals of the raw material due diligence management 
system – in an annual Responsible Raw Materials Report. The 
Group’s specific activities and measures regarding the 16 raw 
materials are also set out there.

Supply Chains and Business > Sustainability in the Supply Chain
Collaboration with suppliers and digital innovations 
for more transparency in the supply chain
Increasing transparency is an important prerequisite for identi-
fying, avoiding and mitigating human rights risks in the up-
stream supply chain. To this end, the Volkswagen Group works  
in the context of the raw materials due diligence management 
system closely with its direct suppliers and business partners. 
For battery raw materials, especially cobalt, we pursue the objec-
tive of creating supply chain transparency from mining the raw 
materials to manufacturing the finished product. We have been 
passing the requirement for full transparency on to our direct 
battery suppliers in our contracts since 2020. Volkswagen has the 
data received audited and verified by partner companies 
through second-party supply chain mapping audits.
With respect to digital innovations, Volkswagen also relies on 
blockchain technology and is working on developing corre-
sponding solutions. This tamper-proof type of data processing  
allows complete and fraud-proof documentation of supply 
streams. We also cooperate with service providers that enable 
suppliers to be competitively audited using artificial intelli-
gence. Here, permanent real-time monitoring of freely available 
internet sources, including social media, provides us with indi-
cations of possible breaches by suppliers. 
Certification of raw materials
Because the human-rights-related risks are often highest at the 
start of the supply chain and these can be countered most effec-
tively here, direct collaboration with mine operators on the certi-
fication of mines is an additional part of our strategy. In this way, 
102
R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  F O R  S U P P LY  C H A I N S  A N D  B U S I N E S S
we intend to audit, assess and improve the sustainability perfor-
mance of the mines in our supply chain in the medium term. 
 
  www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Strategy &  
Reporting > Policy > Responsible Raw Materials Report 
Involvement in International and 
Cross-Industry Initiatives 
In addition to close collaboration with our direct suppliers and 
(sub)suppliers, we get involved in initiatives and local projects to 
address human rights risks in the upstream supply chain and  
beyond our contractual relationships. These cross-industry and, 
in some cases, raw-material-specific initiatives are listed in our 
Responsible Raw Materials Report 2020. The Responsible Raw 
Materials Report 2021 is going to include additional information 
on the initiatives’ goals and the progress of our local projects. 
One example of our approach is Volkswagen AG’s membership of 
the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), un-
der the umbrella of which we work towards a sustainable natural 
rubber supply chain. 
In the case of the battery raw material cobalt, the Volkswagen 
Group is working together with other partners in the Cobalt for 
Development project for improved working and living 
conditions for small-scale cobalt miners and their communities 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The pilot project aims 
to strengthen compliance with laws and improve health and 
safety conditions and social well-being for people locally. Addi-
tional information is available on the project website.
In the case of the battery raw material lithium, the Volkswagen 
Group, together with other partners, has created the Responsible 
Lithium Partnership initiative, which works towards responsible 
use of resources and sustainable lithium production in Salar de 
Atacama in Chile. This is to be achieved through a multi-stake-
holder platform comprising all the relevant players in the Salar 
watershed – from civil society groups, including indigenous 
communities, through government institutions to local mining 
companies.
Beyond raw material activities, our involvement in the industry- 
led initiative DRIVE Sustainability under the umbrella of CSR  
Europe remains key. The development of the common question-
naire standard for auditing sustainability aspects of suppliers 
was a milestone in this respect, as was the training approach for 
suppliers pursued jointly with other OEMs via training events in 
selected countries.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT
TO VOLKSWAGEN AG, WOLFSBURG
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the sepa-
rate nonfinancial report of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg, (hereinaf-
ter the “Company”), which is combined with the separate non-
financial report of the Group (hereinafter the “combined non- 
financial report”), for the period from January 1 to December 31, 
2021. The combined nonfinancial report is included in the Sus-
tainability Report 2021.
Not included in the combined nonfinancial report are the para-
graphs listed in chapter “About This Report” in section “Basis for 
Report” of the Sustainability Report (Interview, Value Chain, The 
German Corporate Governance Code and Further Information, 
Making the Social and Environmental Impact of Our Actions 
Measurable), references to disclosures made outside the com-
bined nonfinancial report (e.g. references to disclosures in the 
Annual Report or to additional sustainability disclosures of the 
Company in the internet), disclosures next to chapter and sec-
tion headings that reference the Standards of the Global Report-
ing Initiative (GRI) as well as the Company’s disclosure that the 
Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance with the GRI 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), applying the 
“Core” option. The aforementioned disclosures were therefore 
not subject to our assurance engagement.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the combined nonfinancial report in accordance 
with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (Handels-
gesetzbuch: German Commercial Code) and Art. 8 of Regulation 
(EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate 
sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 
(hereinafter the “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and the Delegated 
Acts adopted thereunder as well as in accordance with their own 
interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Tax-
onomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as 
set out in the chapter “EU Taxonomy” of the combined nonfinan-
cial report. 
These responsibilities of the Company’s executive directors in-
clude the selection and application of appropriate nonfinancial 
reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates  
about individual nonfinancial disclosures that are reasonable  
in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are  
responsible for such internal control as the executive directors 
consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-
financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud (manipulation of the combined nonfinancial report) 
or error.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted 
thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which 
clarifications have not yet been published in every case. There-
fore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation 
of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted 
thereunder in the chapter “EU Taxonomy” of the combined non-
financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility  
of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined  
legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity 
of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
OF THE AUDITOR’S FIRM
We have complied with the German professional requirements 
on independence as well as other professional conduct 
requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and pro-
fessional pronouncements – in particular the BS WP/vBP (Berufs-
satzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer/vereidigte Buchprüfer: Profes-
sional Charter for German Public Accountants/German Sworn 
Auditors) in the exercise of their profession and the IDW Stan-
dard on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public 
Auditors in Germany (IDW): Requirements for Quality Manage-
ment in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1) and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive quality management system that includes docu-
mented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with 
professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well 
as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUDITOR
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited 
assurance on the combined nonfinancial report based on our 
assurance engagement. 
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information” issued by the IAASB. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any 
matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that 
the Company’s combined nonfinancial report is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction 
with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the 
Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation 
by the executive directors disclosed in chapter “EU Taxonomy” 
of the combined nonfinancial report. 
Not included in the combined nonfinancial report are the 
paragraphs listed in chapter “About this Report” in section “Basis 
for Report” of the Sustainability Report (Interview, Value Chain, 
The German Corporate Governance Code and Further Information, 
Making the Social and Environmental Impact of Our Actions 
Measurable), references to disclosures made outside the 
combined nonfinancial report (e.g. references to disclosures in 
107
A P P E N D I X
the Annual Report or to additional sustainability disclosures of 
the company in the internet), disclosures next to chapter and 
section headings that reference the Standards of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as the Company’s disclosure 
that the Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance with 
the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
applying the “Core” option. The aforementioned disclosures were 
therefore not subject to our assurance engagement.
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed 
are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, 
and, accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is 
obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject  
to the professional judgment of the auditor. 
In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among 
other things, performed the following assurance procedures and 
other activities:
• Inquiries of relevant employees involved in the preparation of 
the combined nonfinancial report about the preparation pro-
cess, about the internal control system related to this process, 
and about disclosures in the combined nonfinancial report,
• Inquiries of the employees regarding the selection of topics for 
the combined nonfinancial report, the risk assessment and the 
concepts of the Company and Group for the topics identified as 
material, 
• Inquiries of employees of the Company and the Group responsi-
ble for data capture and consolidation as well as the preparation 
of the combined nonfinancial report, to evaluate the reporting 
system, the data capture and compilation methods as well as 
internal controls to the extent relevant for the assurance of the 
disclosures in the combined nonfinancial report,
• Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the 
combined nonfinancial report,
• Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the combined 
nonfinancial report at the level of the Company and the Group,
• Inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis relat-
ing to the collection and reporting of selected data,
• Evaluation of the implementation of Group management  
requirements, processes and specifications regarding  
data capture through onsite visits at selected sites of the  
Volkswagen Group:
 -  Audi AG (Ingolstadt, Germany)
 - Volkswagen Group of America Chattanooga Operations LLC 
(Chattanooga, USA)
 - FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd. (Chengdu, China)
 - SAIC Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd. Shanghai (Anting, 
China)
 - Volkswagen BR (São Carlos, Brazil)
 - SEAT S.A. (Martorell, Spain)
 - ŠKODA AUTO a.s. (Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic)
 - Volkswagen AG (Wolfsburg, Germany)
 - Volkswagen AG (Emden, Germany)
 - SCANIA CV AB (Södertälje, Sweden)
• Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding 
data in the annual financial statements and management 
report, 
• Evaluation of the presentation of the combined nonfinancial 
report,
• Evaluation of the process to collect the disclosures according to 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the combined nonfinancial 
report.
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Art. 8 of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to 
interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our 
assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.
ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
Based on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the combined nonfinancial report of the Company 
for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2021 is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in 
conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as 
the interpretation by the executive directors as disclosed in the 
chapter “EU Taxonomy” of the combined nonfinancial report.
We do not express an assurance conclusion on the disclosures 
that are not part of the combined nonfinancial report and that 
were therefore not subject to our assurance engagement. These 
are the paragraphs listed in chapter “About this Report” in 
section “Basis for Report” of the Sustainability Report (Interview, 
Value Chain, The German Corporate Governance Code and 
Further Information, Making the Social and Environmental 
Impact of Our Actions Measurable), references to disclosures 
made outside the combined nonfinancial report (e.g. references 
to disclosures in the Annual Report or to additional 
sustainability disclosures of the Company in the internet), 
disclosures next to chapter and section headings that reference 
the Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as 
the company’s disclosure that the Sustainability Report was 
prepared in compliance with the GRI Standards of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), applying the “Core” option.
RESTRICTION OF USE
We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was 
conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report is 
intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the 
assurance engagement. As a result, it may not be suitable for 
another purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the 
report is not intended to be used by third parties for making 
(financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the 
Company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third 
parties. Our assurance conclusion is not modified in this respect.
